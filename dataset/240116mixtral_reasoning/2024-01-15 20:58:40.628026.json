    "Reason": "\n- The compound contains a benzoate group (COO-) which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds, increasing the melting point. Estimate +20 degrees Celsius.\n- The compound also contains an amine group (-NH2) which can form hydrogen bonds, increasing the melting point. Estimate +10 degrees Celsius.\n- The compound has a cyclopentyl ring which is relatively rigid and can form stronger intermolecular forces due to its shape. Estimate +10 degrees Celsius.\n- The compound has four methyl groups (CH3) which increase molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Estimate +20 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Celsius per methyl group).\n\nSumming these effects for prediction, we have the baseline value of 25 degrees Celsius (+20 for benzoate group) + (+10 for amine group) + (+10 for cyclopentyl ring) + (+20 for methyl groups).\n##Prediction: 65\n\n\n#Problem",
