    "Reason": "\n- The compound (1,2,2,3-tetramethylcyclopentyl)methyl 4-aminobenzoate contains a cyclopentyl ring with four methyl groups, which increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Estimating the effect of each methyl group as about +5 degrees Celsius considering the size and potential increase in van der Waals interactions.\n- The ester group (-COO-) typically raises the melting point due to the polarity it introduces, allowing for stronger intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole interaction). Estimating this effect at about +10 degrees Celsius.\n- The amine group (-NH2) participates in hydrogen bonding, adding to the melting point increase; however, with two proton donors, its contribution is higher than a single amine group. Estimating this effect at about +20 degrees Celsius.\n- The aromatic benzene ring contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. Estimating this effect at about +10 degrees Celsius.\n\nSumming these effects for prediction, we have the baseline value of 25 degrees Celsius (+20 for the ester group) + (4 * +5 for each methyl group) + (+20 for the amine group) + (+10 for the aromatic ring).\n##Prediction: 75\n\n\n#Problem",
