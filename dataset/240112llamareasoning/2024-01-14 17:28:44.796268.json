    "Reason": "The compound 1,3-butanedione, 1-(3-pyridinyl)- contains both diketone and pyridyl functional groups. Starting from a base molecule like acetone, which has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius, the addition of the keto groups generally increases the melting point due to enhanced dipole-dipole interactions. The presence of two keto groups is expected to contribute significantly to the melting point. Each carbonyl group may add roughly +20 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring contributes to rigidity and potential pi-stacking, as well as dipolar interactions due to the nitrogen atom. The pyridyl group could be estimated to add around +30 degrees Celsius. Adjusting for the molecular weight and the ability of the bulkier structure to pack efficiently in a solid state could lead to an increased melting point as well, due to the van der Waals forces. However, the estimated increments for molecular weight are generally lower and less predictable; thus, a conservative estimate of an additional +5 degrees might be included for overall molecular complexity. The increments in temperature need to be adjusted to reflect the actual measured melting point.",
