    "Reason": "The target compound, chlorohydroquinone, is structurally related to benzene. Benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The two hydroxyl groups in chlorohydroquinone greatly increase the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Each hydroxyl group can be expected to raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius, adding a total of +100 degrees Celsius to the base benzene structure. The chlorine substituent is an electron-withdrawing group and enhances the intermolecular attractions due to increased polarity, although its effect is typically less than that of hydroxyl groups. The effect of the chlorine atom is estimated to raise the melting point by an additional +10 degrees Celsius. Hence, combining these effects, the melting point of chlorohydroquinone can be predicted.",
