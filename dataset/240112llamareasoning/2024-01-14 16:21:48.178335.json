    "Reason": "The target compound zonisamide has several functional groups affecting its melting point: benzisoxazole ring, sulfonamide group, and an aliphatic carbon connecting the two. Benzene, our basic aromatic unit, has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of an oxygen and nitrogen into the ring to form the benzisoxazole contributes a higher degree of molecular rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which should substantially increase the melting point. The sulfonamide group is also capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding due to the presence of nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which should contribute an additional increase. The aliphatic carbon itself would have a minor effect, but it contributes minimal steric hindrance and molecular weight, so we expect it to have a moderate increase on the melting point due to the addition of a single carbon atom and the flexibility it provides might slightly reduce the effect of the rigid ring structures. Combining these effects: Benzene (+5.5\u00b0C), oxygen+nitrogen in the ring system (+100\u00b0C), sulfonamide group (+50\u00b0C), and aliphatic carbon (+1\u00b0C), one can predict the melting point.",
