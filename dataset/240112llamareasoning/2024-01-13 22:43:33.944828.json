    "Reason": "The structure of 4-tert-butylbenzophenone consists of benzophenone (diphenylmethanone) as the basic unit with a tert-butyl group added to the para position of one of the benzene rings. Benzophenone has a relatively high melting point due to its planar structure and ability to engage in strong intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, as well as some \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the phenyl groups. The melting point of pure benzophenone is around 48 degrees Celsius. Adding a bulky tert-butyl group increases the molecular weight and volume, which could potentially disrupt the crystal lattice leading to a decrease in melting point due to steric hindrance, which reduces the efficiency of molecular packing. However, the tert-butyl group can also provide more van der Waals forces, potentially raising the melting point slightly. These two effects are somewhat opposing, but the disruption to crystalline packing generally has a more significant effect on the melting point than the increase in van der Waals forces. Therefore, we might predict the melting point to slightly decrease.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a ketone group (C=O) typically increases the melting point due to the polar nature of the carbonyl group and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions. This could add approximately +40\u00b0C. \n- The tert-butyl group is a bulky substituent that can disrupt the crystal lattice, leading to a decrease in the melting point. However, it also increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which could counteract the disruptive effect. The tert-butyl group might decrease the melting point by about -20\u00b0C. \n- The additional phenyl ring contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, which could increase the melting point. This could add approximately +10\u00b0C. \n- The overall effect of these functional groups on the melting point is complex and depends on how they interact with each other and the base structure.\n##Prediction: 35.0\n##Reason",
