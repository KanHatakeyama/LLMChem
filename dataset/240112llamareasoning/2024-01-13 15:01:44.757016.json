    "Reason": "The basic unit for alkanes, methane, has a melting point of -182.5. For each additional carbon in a straight-chain alkane, the melting point tends to increase due to increased Van der Waals forces from the greater surface area. Each methylene unit (CH2) typically adds about 5 to the melting point. However, the introduction of a double bond in an alkene like pent-1-ene lowers the symmetry of the molecule and can slightly reduce the melting point due to less efficient packing in the solid state. For a double bond, this reduction might be around 5 to 10. Hence, starting from methane: -182.5 + (4 additional carbons * 5) - 5 for the double bond.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethene (ethylene) has a melting point of -169.2 \u00b0C. \n- Each additional methylene (CH2) group in a linear alkane chain typically increases the melting point by approximately 2 \u00b0C. Pent-1-ene has four more CH2 groups than ethene. \n- The double bond in pent-1-ene slightly lowers the melting point due to less efficient packing compared to a saturated alkane. However, the effect of the double bond is not as significant as the increase in molecular weight and surface area due to the additional CH2 groups. \n##Prediction: -167.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
