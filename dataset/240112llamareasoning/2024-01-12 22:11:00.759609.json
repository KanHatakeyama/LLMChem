    "Reason": "The core flavone structure confers a relatively high melting point due to the planar, aromatic nature of the system, which allows for strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between molecules. A basic flavone has a melting point in the region of 95-100\u00b0C. The addition of a methoxy (-OCH3) group on the benzene ring introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and contributes to additional dipole-dipole interactions due to the electronegative oxygen, which is expected to marginally increase the melting point, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl (C=O) group and the oxygen within the lactone ring contribute through potential hydrogen bonding with other molecules and stronger dipole-dipole interactions due to their polar nature, which can significantly raise the melting point, estimated at +60\u00b0C. Furthermore, flavones with additional ring substituents typically display higher melting points due to an increase in molecular complexity and intermolecular interaction capabilities.",
