    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a boiling point of 80 degrees Celsius. Each chloromethyl group is expected to increase the boiling point due to the introduction of additional molecular weight and polarizability. However, chlorine atoms are also electron-withdrawing, which can have a stabilizing effect on the electron cloud of the benzene ring, potentially decreasing the boiling point compared to alkyl groups. Each chloromethyl group on benzene usually contributes an increase in the boiling point of around 10 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two chloromethyl groups (\u2013CCl) on the benzene ring will significantly increase the melting point due to the introduction of electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms, which enhance intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each chloromethyl group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 40\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n##Reason",
