    "Reason": "The target compound 1,2-dichloro-4-(trichloromethyl)benzene includes a benzene ring with multiple chlorine substituents, which significantly influence its melting point when compared to the base structure of benzene with a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The electronegativity and mass of the chlorine atoms cause stronger intermolecular forces, be it van der Waals interactions or dipole-induced dipole interactions. Each chlorine on the benzene ring introduces significant polarity and can increase the melting point. Dichloro substituents in the ortho position relative to each other can be expected to increase the melting point by about +10 to +15 degrees Celsius each due to their added electron-withdrawing nature and the increased molecular rigidity they provide. The trichloromethyl group, with three chlorines, is a hefty substituent that will substantially elevate the melting point because of the cumulative effect of three more electronegative atoms and additional molecular weight. The effect of this group might be around +50 to +60 degrees Celsius. When considering these group contributions, the predicted melting point has to take into account the sum of these effects, not forgetting that there can be a non-linear response when adding the influence of multiple substituents.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of substituents will affect this value. Each chlorine atom is a heavy atom that increases the molecular weight and provides significant dipole-dipole interactions, which can significantly raise the melting point. The presence of three chlorine atoms on the benzene ring is expected to increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius per chlorine atom due to these interactions. The trichloromethyl group, which is a bulky and electron-withdrawing group, will also increase the melting point due to its size and the potential for additional dipole-dipole interactions. This group is expected to contribute an additional +10 degrees Celsius to the melting point. The overall increase in molecular weight and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the trichloromethyl group will significantly raise the melting point.\n##Prediction: 31.0\n\n##Prediction",
