    "Reason": "Alclofenac features a benzene ring as its core structure, which has a baseline melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Addition of functional groups will modify this base value. - The chlorine atom, due to its high electronegativity and the polarizability of the resulting C-Cl bond, as well as the additional van der Waals forces it facilitates, typically increases the melting point. This addition may contribute an estimated +40\u00b0C. - The vinyl group (ethenyl, C=C) is a relatively small group and not highly electron-withdrawing, so its effect on the melting point would likely be relatively modest, perhaps around +5\u00b0C. - The ester group (COO) is a polar functional group capable of engaging in dipole-dipole interactions, and might raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to these intermolecular forces. - The acetyl group (CC(=O)O) is planar and may enable better packing and stacking in the solid state, potentially adding another +20\u00b0C to the melting point. Adding these values to the baseline gives an estimated total increase.",
