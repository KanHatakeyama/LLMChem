    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the benzene ring, as in pyrocatechol, significantly affects the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding. However, a 50 degrees Celsius increase for each hydroxyl group seems excessive. Typically, a hydroxyl group can be expected to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, but the effect should be evaluated more conservatively. A range of 20-30 degrees Celsius increase per hydroxyl group is more reasonable. Thus, the combined contribution of two hydroxyl groups would be approximately 40-60 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound Pyrocatechol has a benzene ring and a hydroxyl group. The benzene ring provides a base melting point, and the hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point.\n- Basic unit, benzene: The base melting point of benzene is 5.5 \u00b0C.\n- Hydroxyl group: The hydroxyl group can form strong hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. We can estimate this effect to be around +100 \u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
