    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, cyclohexanone has a melting point of around 42\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a phenyl group generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi interactions, which can be estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The addition of a methyl group to the bicyclic structure can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a second phenyl group further increases the melting point due to additional pi-pi interactions and van der Waals forces, estimated at +15\u00b0C. \n- The bicyclic structure contributes to a higher melting point due to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can be estimated at +10\u00b0C. \n- The ketone group (C=O) is polar and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, which can increase the melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall structure is complex and the effects of the functional groups are not strictly additive, so the actual increase may be less than the sum of the individual contributions.\n##Prediction: 87.0\n##Reason",
