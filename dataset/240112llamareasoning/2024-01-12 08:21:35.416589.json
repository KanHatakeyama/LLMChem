    "Reason": "Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of about 5.5\u00b0C. Each additional phenyl group adds about +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. The -NH2 (amine) groups collectively add about +80\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding capabilities and increased polarity. The bromine atom adds about +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The 1,2,4-triazine ring adds about +50\u00b0C because of its nitrogen heteroatoms which strongly influence the packing in the solid state and its potential for hydrogen bonding. These shifts are not simply additive but can give an estimated sum for predicting the melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound N~5~-(4-bromophenyl)-6-phenyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5-diamine has several functional groups that influence its melting point. The base structure is similar to biphenyl, which has a melting point of around 70 degrees Celsius. The presence of a bromine atom on a phenyl ring increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The triazine ring, which contains nitrogen and sulfur atoms, significantly raises the melting point due to the rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding; this could be estimated at +100-120 degrees Celsius. The presence of two amine groups (\u2013NH2) can form hydrogen bonds, which would further increase the melting point; this effect could be estimated at +20-30 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 220.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
