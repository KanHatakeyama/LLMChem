    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of Isatin Thiosemicarbazone, we can begin by considering the contributions of its functional groups and structural features to its melting point. Here is the breakdown: \n- Basic molecular structure (Isatin): Isatin itself has a relatively high melting point due to its rigid planar structure and the presence of hydrogen bonding. Presence of both keto and amide groups stabilizes the crystal lattice increasing the melting point. Assume the base value of isatin to be around 200\u00b0C since it has a melting point of 201-203\u00b0C. \n- Thiosemicarbazone group: The addition of a thiosemicarbazide group to isatin would typically increase the melting point due to additional opportunities for hydrogen bonding and increased molecular rigidity. The sulfur may also participate in stronger intermolecular interactions. We can assume an increment of approximately +30\u00b0C. \n- Aromatic ring: The aromatic system in isatin is already accounted for in the base value, thus no additional increment is needed for the phenyl part. \nThe overall increment for Isatin Thiosemicarbazone would therefore be due to the thiosemicarbazone grouping, as the base molecule of isatin and the aromaticity has already been considered.
