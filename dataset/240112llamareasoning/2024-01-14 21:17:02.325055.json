    "Reason": "The target compound N-(hydroxymethyl)benzamide can be analyzed based on its functional groups compared to a reference compound, benzamide, whose melting point is 130 degrees Celsius. The presence of a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is expected to lower the melting point relative to benzamide. The hydroxymethyl group introduces additional flexibility and lowers the symmetry of the molecule, which typically reduces the melting point because it can disrupt the crystalline lattice formation: -CH2OH effect approximately -30 to -35 (based on similar hydroxyalkyl substitutions on aromatic systems). Additionally, hydroxymethyl may participate in hydrogen bonding, but this effect is less predictable: hydroxyl (OH) can form hydrogen bonds but they don\u2019t necessarily increase the melting point as they could either lead to a more ordered structure, or introduce disorder if they prevent effective packing. We estimate this effect to be around -5, due to competing effects in the solid phase (enhanced molecular interactions vs. steric hindrance and disruption of crystal packing). Summing up the effects, we get a total estimated decrease of approximately -35 to -40 degrees Celsius from the benzamide reference melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Amide group: +80\u00b0C (due to strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability). \n- Hydroxymethyl group: +20\u00b0C (due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase polarity). \n- The presence of both functional groups contributes to an increase in the melting point due to the strong intermolecular forces they introduce. \n- The amide group's contribution is slightly less than initially estimated, as it does not significantly increase the melting point beyond the initial prediction. \n- The hydroxymethyl group's contribution is also less than initially estimated, as it does not significantly increase the melting point beyond the initial prediction. \n##Prediction: 105.0\n##Reason",
