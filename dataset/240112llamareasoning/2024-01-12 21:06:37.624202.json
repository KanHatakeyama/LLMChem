    "Reason": "The basic units for fumaronitrile are an alkene and two nitrile groups. For alkenes, we can start with ethylene, which has a melting point of \u2212169.2\u00b0C. Each nitrile (cyano) group raises the melting point due to the strong dipole-dipole interactions and potential for cyano-cyano interactions across molecules. We can assign a +130\u00b0C contribution per nitrile group. There is also a contribution due to the conjugated system of the double bond with the nitrile groups, which adds rigidity and pi-pi interactions that could further raise the melting point, estimated at +10\u00b0C. Combining these factors: ethylene base (-169.2), nitrile contributions (2 * +130), and conjugation (+10).",
