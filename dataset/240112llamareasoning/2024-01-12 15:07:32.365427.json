    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzoic acid, has a melting point of 122\u00b0C. The ethyl ester group tends to lower the melting point compared to the acid due to a decrease in hydrogen bonding capacity (-5). However, the presence of the indole moiety, similar to an additional fused benzene ring, will increase the melting point due to greater pi-pi interactions and rigid structure (+7).",
