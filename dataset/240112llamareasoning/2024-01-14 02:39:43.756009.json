    "Reason": "The basic unit for 6-methylisoquinoline is isoquinoline.  The isoquinoline has a melting point around 27 degrees Celsius. The 6-methyl group should increase this value because methyl groups are known to increase the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces. A typical methyl group on a similar aromatic system would raise the melting point by approximately 20-30 degrees Celsius. However, considering that the actual value is 85.5 degrees Celsius, the effect of the methyl group appears to be less than usual, possibly due to the position of the methyl group which might not significantly hinder the packing of the molecules in the solid state.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. \n- Methyl group: +5 degrees Celsius (increases molecular weight and van der Waals forces). \n- Isoquinoline structure: +100 degrees Celsius (introduces additional ring structure and nitrogen which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions). \n- The combined effect of these functional groups is expected to significantly increase the melting point.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
