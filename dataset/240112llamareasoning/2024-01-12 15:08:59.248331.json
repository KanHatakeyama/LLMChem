    "Reason": "The compound 4-methyl-2-nitroaniline consists of an aniline moiety modified by the addition of a methyl group and a nitro group. Aniline itself has a melting point of \u22126 degrees Celsius. The substitution of these groups can significantly alter the melting point. The methyl group typically raises the melting point. Due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, we estimate this raise at +5 degrees Celsius. However, the more significant effect comes from the nitro group, which due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature and ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, typically contributes heavily to increases in melting points, estimated at about +120 degrees Celsius for the dramatic effect it can have in solid-state structure and intermolecular interactions. Therefore, if we add these effects together, we predict the melting point for 4-methyl-2-nitroaniline to be considerably higher than that of aniline.",
