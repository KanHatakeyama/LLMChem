    "Reason": "The basic unit for 1,1,2-trichloroethane can be considered as ethane, which has a melting point of -183.3 degrees Celsius. Each chloro functional group will raise the melting point relative to ethane due to increased molecular weight and enhanced van der Waals forces. However, the overall shape of the molecule remains fairly symmetrical, not drastically affecting the melting point. Given that each chloro group is similar, we can estimate an incremental increase per chloro group. If we estimate an increment of +49 degrees Celsius per chloro group, for three chloro groups, the total increase would be +147 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethane has a melting point of -183.3\u00b0C. \n- Each chlorine atom adds to the molecular weight and increases the intermolecular forces due to its electronegativity and polarizability, which typically raises the melting point. However, the presence of three chlorine atoms in a small molecule like 1,1,2-trichloroethane can lead to steric hindrance and less efficient packing in the solid state, which might lower the melting point. \n- The effect of each chlorine atom on the melting point is not simply additive due to these factors. \n- The actual value of -37.0\u00b0C suggests that the increase in molecular weight and intermolecular forces due to the chlorine atoms is not enough to overcome the destabilizing effect of the steric hindrance.\n##Prediction: -37.0\n##Reason",
