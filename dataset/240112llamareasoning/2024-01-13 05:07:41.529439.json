    "Reason": "The basic unit to compare with might be glucose, since miglustat resembles a modified glucose molecule; glucose has a melting point of about 146 degrees Celsius. The following changes are present in miglustat: (1) a hydroxyl group at position 2 is replaced by a nitrogen-containing six-membered ring. Replacing a hydroxy group with a more complex, heterocyclic ring system could potentially heighten the melting point due to additional van der Waals forces and possible hydrogen bonding, let's approximate this increase to be around +20 degrees Celsius. (2) The nitrogen substituent includes butyl chains (propyl + methyl) which should raise the melting point slightly due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; let's estimate the butyl effect to be +5 degrees Celsius for the propyl part and +2 for the methyl part. Summing the effects gives an increase of 27 degrees Celsius to the base melting point of glucose.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of around 20 degrees Celsius.\n- The presence of the methyl group (CH3) attached to the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring typically increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +5 degrees.\n- The presence of the ethyl group (C2H5) attached to the nitrogen in the pyridine ring also increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +10 degrees.\n- The presence of the two hydroxyl groups (OH) significantly increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, estimated at +40 degrees for each group.\n- The presence of the amide group (CONH) contributes to the melting point through hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, estimated at +50 degrees.\n- The overall molecular complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups that can engage in intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions will further increase the melting point, estimated at +20 degrees.\n##Prediction: 155.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
