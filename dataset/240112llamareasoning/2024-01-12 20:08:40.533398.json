    "Reason": "The basic unit for p-hydroxybenzoic acid is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The carboxyl group (-COOH) substantially increases the melting point due to its ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and its resonance stability, this can be estimated to raise the melting point by about +160 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at the para position will also increase the melting point due to its hydrogen bonding capability, contributing an estimated additional +50 degrees Celsius. These functional groups contribute to intermolecular forces that make the compound more rigid, thus requiring more energy to melt.",
