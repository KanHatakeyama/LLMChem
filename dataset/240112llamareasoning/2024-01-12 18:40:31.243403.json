    "Reason": "The compound 6-aminophthalide is composed of a phthalide backbone, which is a benzene ring fused with a five-membered lactone ring, and an amino group attached to the benzene ring. The rigid fused-ring structure of the phthalide contributes significantly to the melting point by promoting a tight molecular packing in the solid state, possibly adding around +100 units above the benzene baseline. The lactone functionality augments this effect due to its capability for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, further increasing the melting point by an estimated +30 units. The primary amino group can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which would likely increase the melting point by another +50 units. The cumulative effect of these functional groups leads to a considerable elevation in melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the phthalide structure, which includes a lactam ring, contributes to the melting point through increased rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding. This could add approximately +100\u00b0C. \n- The amino group (-NH2) can form hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point. This could add around +20\u00b0C. \n- The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. This could add around +50\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the additional methylene group (CH2) in the phthalide structure may slightly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but this effect is generally less pronounced than the effects of the functional groups mentioned above. This could add around +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall structure of the molecule, with its rigid and planar structure, also contributes to a higher melting point due to better packing in the solid state. This effect is difficult to quantify but could add another +20\u00b0C. \n##Prediction: 190.0\n##Reason",
