    "Reason": "The basic unit methane has a melting point of -182.5\u00b0C. The fluorination of the hydrogens results in a higher melting point due to the polarity and the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond compared to the carbon-hydrogen bond. Each fluorine is estimated to add around +20\u00b0C due to these effects. However, since there is one hydrogen left in the structure, we don't have complete fluorination which would maximize the melting point. Therefore, the increment is slightly lower than the theoretical maximum per fluorine atom. The addition of four fluorine atoms would thus contribute approximately +80\u00b0C in total.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethane, has a melting point of -183.3 \u00b0C. \n- Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and introduce strong dipole-dipole interactions, which typically increase the melting point. Each fluorine atom is estimated to contribute +20 \u00b0C. \n- The tetrafluoroethane molecule has four fluorine atoms, so the total increase would be +80 \u00b0C. \n- The molecule is symmetrical, which can lead to better packing in the solid phase, potentially increasing the melting point. \n- The molecule is small and has a low molecular weight, which can also contribute to a lower melting point. \n- The presence of four fluorine atoms also increases the molecular weight and size, which can slightly increase the melting point. \n- The overall effect of the fluorine atoms is expected to be the dominant factor in determining the melting point. \n##Prediction: -103.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
