    "Reason": "The compound in question contains several functional groups and structural features that influence its melting point: \n- Basic unit, biphenyl, has a melting point around 70\u00b0C. \n- Two ester groups: Each can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to their capability of forming dipole-dipole interactions and perhaps weak hydrogen bonds, giving +40\u00b0C in total. \n- Four nitro groups: Each nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and can engage in intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each can be reasonably estimated to increase the melting point by +15\u00b0C, giving +60\u00b0C in total. \n- Ethylene linkages: The presence of ethylene links between the aromatic rings and ester groups may provide some flexibility to the molecule, slightly lowering the symmetry and possibly reducing the melting point. This might give a combined effect of -10\u00b0C for the two ethylene groups. \n- The overall structure is relatively rigid and planar, which promotes stacking and crystalline packing, aiding in a higher melting point. However, since we\u2019ve already considered the individual group contributions, this effect is not quantified separately to avoid double-counting.\nCombining these effects: 70 (biphenyl) + 40 (esters) + 60 (nitro groups) - 10 (ethylene linkages) = 160\u00b0C",
