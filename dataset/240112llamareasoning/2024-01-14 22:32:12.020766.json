    "Reason": "The target compound n-heptyl hydroperoxide (C7H15OOH) has functional groups that affect its melting point. First, we consider n-heptane, as it is the hydrocarbon backbone of our molecule. The melting point of n-heptane is -90.6\u00b0C. Each additional -CH2- group in a straight-chain alkane generally increases the melting point by about 20 to 30\u00b0C, but as we already account for heptane, we do not need to add further increase for each methylene group. Hydroperoxides, with their -OOH group, have the ability for hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point; however, this effect is generally less pronounced than what is observed with alcohols or carboxylic acids due to the less favorable hydrogen bond donor ability of the -OOH group. Comparing to alcohols, which can increase the melting point around 50 to 100\u00b0C because of hydrogen bonding, it's reasonable to estimate the increase for a hydroperoxide group would be roughly half of that, so an increase of approximately 25 to 50\u00b0C. Thus, combining the base value of n-heptane with the influence of the hydroperoxide, we arrive at an estimated increase in melting point.",
