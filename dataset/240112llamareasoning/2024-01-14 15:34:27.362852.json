    "Reason": "The target compound isophthalaldehyde consists of a benzene ring with two formyl groups (\u2013CHO) attached in the meta position. Benzene as the basic unit has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The formyl groups increase the melting point due to the introduction of greater molecular weight, additional rigidity, and the ability for carbonyl groups to engage in dipole-dipole interactions, enhancing the intermolecular forces. Furthermore, the meta substitution of the formyl groups may support a more crystalline and ordered structure, likely leading to a higher melting point. Quantitatively, if we estimate that each formyl group increases the melting point by approximately 41\u00b0C, we account for the influence of both formyl groups on benzene's base melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The aldehyde group (\u2013CHO) can form hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. \n- The isophthalaldehyde structure introduces additional rigidity and planarity, which can further increase the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two phenyl rings contributes to the melting point through increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +15\u00b0C for each ring. \n- The overall structure is planar and rigid, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, further increasing the melting point. This effect is difficult to quantify but can be estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The molecule has a relatively high molecular weight, which can also contribute to an increased melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can significantly increase the melting point. Each hydroxyl group can be estimated to contribute +20\u00b0C. \n- The compound has a symmetrical structure, which can facilitate better packing and higher melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The total estimated increase is the sum of the contributions from each functional group.\n##Prediction: 75.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
