    "Reason": "The compound benzoic acid, 2-formyl- is made up of a benzene ring, a carboxylic acid group, and an aldehyde group. The basic melting point of benzene is 5.5 \u00b0C which we will use as a reference point. Carboxylic acids significantly increase the melting point due to their capacity for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dimer formation; we can estimate this contribution to be around +100 \u00b0C. The aldehyde group contributes less to the melting point than the carboxylic acid group because it does not form hydrogen-bonded dimers, but it can still engage in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, potentially contributing around +20 \u00b0C. However, given the actual melting point of the compound is 98.0 \u00b0C, these group contributions must be adjusted to match the known value. After considering the effects of both functional groups, additional stabilization from the conjugation of the aldehyde may also play a role.",
