    "Reason": "The clobuzarit molecule consists of multiple functional groups that influence its melting point. First, the basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The molecule includes two phenyl groups, which will increase the melting point due to \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions and increased molecular weight, each phenyl group adds about +20 \u00b0C. The presence of a chlorine atom contributes to higher melting point due to increased molecular weight and possible dipole-dipole interactions; it's worth estimating an increase of +50 \u00b0C. The tertiary butyl ether (COC(C)(C)C) group is a large, bulky group that increases the molecular weight significantly, contributing to higher melting point, approximately +30 \u00b0C. The carboxylic ester (COO) group can form hydrogen bonds and dipole-dipole interactions which can also increase the melting point, estimated +40 \u00b0C. However, the presence of these multiple non-covalent interactions could have a synergistic effect, making a simple additive model less accurate. Adjusting for synergistic interactions, we can estimate a lower combined increase.",
