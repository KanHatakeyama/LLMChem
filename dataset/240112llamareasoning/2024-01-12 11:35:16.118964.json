    "Reason": "The structure of nicofuranose contains multiple functional groups that can influence its melting point. Starting with a benzene ring as the basic unit, which typically has a melting point around 5.5 \u00b0C:\n- Carboxylic ester groups (five in total): each can increase the melting point due to enhanced polar interactions and possible intra- or intermolecular hydrogen bonding. A conservative estimate would be an addition of about +20 \u00b0C for each ester group.\n- Furanyl rings (three in total): each furanyl ring likely contributes to increased rigidity and potential aromatic stacking interactions, which can raise the melting point. Estimating a +10 \u00b0C increase for each of these rings.\n- Pyridine rings (three in total): nitrogen in the ring contributes to stronger intermolecular interactions compared to benzene, which can raise the melting point. Estimating a +15 \u00b0C increase for each pyridine ring.\n\nThe adjustments are cumulative, so with the above considerations, we can predict an additive effect on the melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, furan, has a melting point of -85.6 \u00b0C.\n- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (OH) significantly increases the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Each OH group can contribute approximately +50 to +60 \u00b0C. There are six OH groups in the target compound.\n- The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) also contributes to the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding. This could add approximately +20 to +30 \u00b0C.\n- The sugar ring structure (furanose) adds rigidity to the molecule, which can increase the melting point. This could contribute an additional +20 to +30 \u00b0C.\n- The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and substituents, which can lead to a higher melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. This could add approximately +10 to +20 \u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 120.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
