    "Reason": "The basic aliphatic chain of undecane has a melting point of -25.6 degrees Celsius. The presence of the ketone functional group, particularly 3-undecanone where the carbonyl is closer to the end than to the center, typically introduces a polar character to the molecule, increasing intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Considering its position on the third carbon and the fact that the long hydrocarbon chains slightly diminish the polar effect by adding to the molecular weight and increasing London dispersion forces, the ketone is estimated to elevate the melting point by approximately 37.6 degrees Celsius (given that ketones are polar and influence the melting point, but the effect is dampened by the long nonpolar chains).",
