    "Reason": "The parent structure, benzoic acid, has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius. The addition of the isopropyl group to the aromatic ring generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for van der Waals interactions, however, it also introduces steric hindrance which disrupts the planarity and packing efficiency of the molecules in the solid state. This can slightly lower the melting point compared to unsubstituted benzoic acid. Considering these effects, the isopropyl group's influence will be approximated as a net decrease of about 3 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The base structure for predicting the melting point of 4-isopropylbenzoic acid is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The isopropyl group is an alkyl chain that increases the molecular weight and provides some steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point. The carboxylic acid group is capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds, which significantly raises the melting point. The isopropyl group is expected to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to its alkyl chain effect and the acid group is expected to add approximately +100\u00b0C due to its ability to form strong hydrogen bonds.\n##Prediction: 135.0\n\n##Prediction",
