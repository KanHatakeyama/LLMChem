    "Reason": "The compound 5-methyl-1,10-phenanthroline is composed of a phenanthroline moiety with an additional methyl group. The basic phenanthroline unit, similar to pyridine, has a melting point of about 23\u00b0C. Phenanthroline itself is a polycyclic compound with nitrogen atoms in the rings, which raises the melting point due to increased rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, though exact data for pure phenanthroline is less common. A single methyl group typically raises the melting point of an aromatic compound by 5-10\u00b0C due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Considering the complexity and rigidity of the phenanthroline structure, we will apply a melting point increment somewhat higher than what we would for a simpler aromatic compound, so approximately 70\u00b0C for the base phenanthroline structure and an additional 20\u00b0C for the methyl group.",
