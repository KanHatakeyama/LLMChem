    "Reason": "The basic unit for the prediction is aniline (phenylamine), which has a melting point of around \u22126 \u00b0C. A cyclohexyl group is added to the para position of the benzene ring in 4-cyclohexylbenzenamine. The cyclohexyl group is bulky and non-polar, and it increases the molecular weight significantly compared to a hydrogen atom it replaces. The increased molecular weight and non-polar nature of the cyclohexyl group typically raise the melting point due to greater London dispersion forces. Furthermore, the cyclohexyl substituent introduces steric hindrance, which can disrupt the crystal lattice of the compound, potentially impacting its melting point. The hindrance by the cyclohexyl substituent, however, does not raise the melting point substantially as it does not contribute to intermolecular hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions. Considering the effects, the increase in melting point due to the cyclohexyl group can be estimated to be around 60 \u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The cyclohexyl group is a large, non-polar alkyl chain that increases the molecular weight and provides van der Waals interactions, which typically raises the melting point. This can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. \n- The amine group can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. This effect can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 40\u00b0C. \n- The combination of these effects should be additive. \n##Prediction: 65.5\n\n\n#Problem",
