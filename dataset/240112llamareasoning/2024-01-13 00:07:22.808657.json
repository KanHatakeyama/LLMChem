    "Reason": "The basic unit, cyclohexane, has a melting point of 6.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of a tert-butyl group (tertiary-butyl, (CH3)3C-) typically raises the melting point as it increases molecular weight and volume, however in this case, it significantly lowers the melting point due to increasing steric hindrance which disrupts crystalline packing, leading to a less stable solid phase and a lower melting point. The tert-butyl group effect might be estimated as -47.6 \u00b0C.",
