    "Reason": "The starting point for comparison could be benzoic acid, which has a melting point of approximately 122 degrees Celsius. The 1,2-hydrazinedicarboxylic acid diethyl ester features functional groups such as ester (-COOC-) and hydrazine (-NH-NH-) that will affect the melting point. The ester groups often increase the melting point due to polar interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +5 degrees for each ester group. The hydrazine functionality should further elevate the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase in molecular rigidity; this might contribute an additional +8 to +10 degrees. Conversely, the diethyl ester groups impart larger alkyl chains which can reduce the melting point by making the molecule bulkier and less capable of efficient packing, possibly subtracting around -2 degrees for each ethyl group, totaling -4 degrees. Combining these effects yields an estimate for the melting point.",
