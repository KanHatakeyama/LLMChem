    "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of around 42 \u00b0C. The introduction of an amino group can lead to increased hydrogen bonding, significantly raising the melting point by approximately +80 \u00b0C. Each chloro substituent will contribute to a higher melting point due to increased molecular weight and enhanced van der Waals interactions; this effect is estimated at about +25 \u00b0C per chloro group. Taking into account these substituent effects without considering the potential disruptiveness of the chloro groups on the overall symmetry and crystal packing, which are harder to predict quantitatively without detailed analysis.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyridine has a melting point of 115\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the amino group (-NH2) generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can be estimated to add about +20\u00b0C. \n- Each chlorine atom, being an electron-withdrawing group, increases the melting point due to the increased polarity and intermolecular forces, estimated at +10\u00b0C per chlorine atom. \n- The nitrogen in the amino group is also involved in hydrogen bonding, which could further increase the melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular structure is more rigid and planar due to the presence of the chlorines and the amino group, which could contribute to a higher melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the nitrogen in the amino group also contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, which could further increase the melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The cumulative effect of these functional groups should be additive. \n##Prediction: 165.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
