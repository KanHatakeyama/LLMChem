    "Reason": "The base structure for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the ortho-di hydroxy groups in resorcinol leads to strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which considerably raises the melting point. Each hydroxy group could contribute to an increase in the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. Additionally, the two acetate groups (-OCC(=O)O) contribute by increasing the molecular weight and providing more opportunities for intermolecular hydrogen bonding; each acetate group could add approximately +25\u00b0C to the melting point. The effects of the hydroxy and acetate groups are additive.",
