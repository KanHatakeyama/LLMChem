    "Reason": "The basic unit for 1-iodopentane would be pentane, which has a melting point of -130. The addition of an iodine atom increases the molecular weight significantly and also introduces stronger intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces) due to the larger electron cloud of iodine. Iodine atom: +44 (due to larger molecular weight and increased van der Waals interaction).",
