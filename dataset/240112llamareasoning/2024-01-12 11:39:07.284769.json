    "Reason": "The basic unit is benzene which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (41.9\u00b0F). Adding fluorine atoms generally increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity and ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine might add roughly +20\u00b0C to the melting point. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contributes significantly to the melting point due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds. This can add approximately +70\u00b0C. Thus, the combination of these effects should be considered for the final prediction.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a carboxylic acid group (\u2013COOH) generally increases the melting point due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds. This effect can be estimated to be around +100 degrees Celsius. The presence of two fluorine atoms on the aromatic ring (\u2013F) will also increase the melting point due to the electronegativity of fluorine and the polarizability of the molecule. Each fluorine might contribute an additional +5 degrees Celsius. The overall prediction would be: 5.5 (benzene) + 100 (carboxylic acid) + 2 * 5 (fluorine) = 110.5 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 110.0\n\n##Prediction",
