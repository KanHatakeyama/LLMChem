    "Reason": "The compound 2-amino-4-methylbenzonitrile contains several functional groups: a benzene ring, an amino group, a nitrile group, and a methyl group. Each of these will influence the melting point differently. The benzene ring provides a starting point for the melting point estimation. The addition of an amino group tends to significantly increase the melting point as it allows for hydrogen bonding, contributing to a stronger intermolecular force (+50). The nitrile group, with its strong dipole and the ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions, further increases the melting point (+35). The methyl group adds some, though lesser, increase due to van der Waals interactions (+5). These increments should be added to the base value of the benzene ring to predict the overall melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The amino group (-NH2) is capable of hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. We can estimate this increase to be around +80\u00b0C. \n- The methyl group attached to the benzene ring typically raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. We can estimate this increase to be around +10\u00b0C. \n- The nitrile group (-C#N) is a polar group that can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. We can estimate this increase to be around +15\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular structure is complex and the effects of the functional groups are not strictly additive, but the predicted values should give a rough estimate of the melting point.\n##Prediction: 110.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
