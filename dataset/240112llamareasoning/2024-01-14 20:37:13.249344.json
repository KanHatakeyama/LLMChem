    "Reason": "When predicting the melting point of 2-chloroethanol, we consider the influence of its functional groups on the base structure of ethane, which has a melting point of -172 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom is larger and more electronegative than a hydrogen atom it replaces, leading to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, which typically raises the melting point. The increase because of chlorination is roughly +70 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group (-OH) also substantially increases the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are strong intermolecular forces. The influence of a hydroxyl group is around +35 degrees Celsius. Thus, the combined effect of chlorination and hydroxyl addition would lead to an overall increase in the melting point.",
