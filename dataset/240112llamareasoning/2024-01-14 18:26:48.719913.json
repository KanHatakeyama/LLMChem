    "Reason": "The predicted melting point for 2-chlorophenylacetonitrile incorporates the melting point of the basic phenyl structure and adjustments for substituents. The basic phenyl has a melting point similar to benzene, which is 5.5 degrees Celsius. Adding a chlorine to the phenyl ring increases the melting point due to the higher atomic mass and potential for increased van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions. This increase is estimated to be +20 degrees. The nitrile group enhances the melting point because of its ability to act as a hydrogen bond acceptor and its strong electronegativity, adding roughly +10 to the melting point. The alkyl chain (ethylene group) adds some flexibility and reduces the extent to which the molecules can pack efficiently, slightly lowering the melting point; this effect is approximately -5 degrees. Summing these contributions gives the estimated melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of a chloro substituent typically increases the melting point due to the inductive effect and the increase in molecular weight. The chloro group can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point. The acetonitrile group, being a polar and linear molecule, can form dipole-dipole interactions and may slightly increase the melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 26.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
