    "Reason": "Starting with ethane as a base, which has a melting point of roughly -182\u00b0C, the addition of functional groups to form acetamide results in substantial changes in the melting point. The methyl group (CH3-) contributes a small increase in melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group (C=O) introduces a significant increase in melting point due to strong polar interactions and dipole-dipole forces, estimated at approximately +45\u00b0C. The amide group (-CONH2) causes the greatest increase in melting point due to its ability to participate in extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is a very strong force. The increase from the amide group is estimated at around +207\u00b0C. By summing these contributions, the predicted melting point for acetamide would align closely with the actual value.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for acetamide is acetic acid, which has a melting point of -13.5. The introduction of an amide group (\u2013CONH2) significantly increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization. The amide group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 100 degrees.\n##Prediction: 86.5\n\n\n#Prediction",
