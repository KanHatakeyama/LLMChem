    "Reason": "The basic unit for dulcitol can be considered as hexane, which has a melting point of -95\u00b0C. Dulcitol has six hydroxyl groups attached to the hexane backbone. Each hydroxyl group increases the ability for hydrogen bonding, substantially raising the melting point. Each hydroxyl (OH) group could be estimated to add about 47.5\u00b0C to the melting point of the base structure (since 6*47.5 \u2248 285, and 285 - 95 brings us close to the actual melting point).",
