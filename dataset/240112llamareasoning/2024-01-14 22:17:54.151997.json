    "Reason": "Starting base unit is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122\u00b0C. Adding hydroxy groups (OH) generally increases the melting point due to the hydrogen bonding, with an approximate increment of +40\u00b0C for each hydroxy group. Two methoxy groups (OCH3) are expected to raise the melting point as well due to an increase in molecular weight and slight increase in polarity, estimate an increase of +10\u00b0C for each methoxy group. However, because of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding that may occur between the hydroxy group and the carboxyl group, the net effect on the melting point might be less than that of typical hydrogen bond formation, therefore, we will adjust the hydroxy contribution to +30\u00b0C. Thus, 122\u00b0C (benzoic acid) + 40\u00b0C (two methoxy groups) + 30\u00b0C (hydroxy group) = 192\u00b0C.",
