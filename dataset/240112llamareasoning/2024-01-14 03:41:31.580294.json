    "Reason": "The compound 3-methyl-butyraldehyde oxime can be examined by considering the effects of its functional groups and structure relative to a simpler molecule. A good starting reference compound could be butanal, which has a melting point around -78. As we analyze the effects of different groups, we need to consider the following contributions: \n\n- Aldehyde to oxime: The aldehyde group in butanal is substituted by an oxime group in 3-methyl-butyraldehyde oxime. The oxime group, with its nitrogen, allows for stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding, significantly increasing the melting point. Increase: +110 \n- Methyl group: The extra methyl group on the third carbon increases the molecular weight and provides some steric hindrance that could slightly raise the melting point. Increase: +20\n\nCombining these effects with the known melting point of butanal, we can estimate the melting point of 3-methyl-butyraldehyde oxime.",
