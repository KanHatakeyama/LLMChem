    "Reason": "The basic unit phenol has a melting point of 41 degrees Celsius. The amino group (-NH2) is expected to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point significantly; this can be estimated as a +50 increase for its contribution. The ethylene glycol side chain (-CH2CH2OH) also contributes to hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point; however, due to its flexibility which diminishes its ability to create a rigid lattice, the effect will be less than that of the amino group. This can be estimated as a +20 increase. The combined effects of these functional groups suggest a higher melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the amino group (-NH2) is expected to increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +40\u00b0C. \n- The hydroxyl group (-OH) is capable of strong hydrogen bonding, which typically raises the melting point significantly, estimated at +50\u00b0C. \n- The ethyl group (-CH2CH3) adds some flexibility and steric bulk, which might slightly lower the melting point, estimated at -5\u00b0C. \n- The overall structure is a phenyl ring with two substituents, which can lead to a more rigid structure that might increase the melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The combined effect of these functional groups should be considered for the prediction.\n##Prediction: 100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
