    "Reason": "The base structure, pyrrole, has a melting point around 23 degrees Celsius. Substitutions on the pyrrole ring can either raise or lower this temperature depending on their nature and position. Carbethoxy groups (-CO2Ethyl) are electron-withdrawing due to the presence of oxygen atoms and can be expected to increase the melting point through stronger intermolecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each carbethoxy group might contribute around +40 to +50 degrees Celsius. Methyl groups (-CH3) are electron-donating and can provide additional van der Waals forces, slightly increasing the melting point, but they also increase steric hindrance, which could disrupt packing. Each methyl group might contribute around +5 to +10 degrees Celsius. The combined effects of two carbethoxy groups (+80 to +100) and two methyl groups (+10 to +20) would yield an estimated increase of +90 to +120 degrees Celsius on top of the base pyrrole melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyrrole has a melting point of around 23\u00b0C. \n- Methyl groups: Each methyl group typically raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, in this case, the presence of the carbonyl groups and the overall molecular complexity may limit the effect of each methyl group to around +5\u00b0C. \n- Carbethoxy groups: Each carbethoxy group (\u2013OC(=O)\u2013) is likely to increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The effect of each carbethoxy group could be estimated at around +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two methyl groups and two carbethoxy groups will lead to an increase in the melting point due to the cumulative effects of these substituents. \n- The molecule has a rigid structure which can lead to better packing in the solid state, potentially increasing the melting point. \n- The overall molecular complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups will lead to a higher melting point than a simple aromatic compound. \n- The presence of the pyrrole ring, which is a rigid, aromatic system, will contribute to a higher melting point due to its planarity and the ability to stack well in the solid state. \n- The molecule has a relatively high molecular weight, which can also contribute to an increased melting point. \n- The presence of multiple sites for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions will further increase the melting point. \n- The overall prediction should be adjusted to account for these factors.\n##Prediction: 145.0",
