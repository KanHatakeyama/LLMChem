    "Reason": "The target compound, 4-(cyanoacetyl)morpholine, can be broken down into individual functional group contributions to predict its melting point. The base structure can be considered as morpholine, which has a melting point of -5 degrees Celsius. Adding a cyano group (nitrile) typically raises the melting point by approximately 40 to 80 degrees due to the increase in polarity and possible dipole-dipole interactions. The acetyl group (ketone) typically increases the melting point by approximately 20 to 50 degrees due to the dipole associated with the carbonyl and the increase in molecular weight. The combination of these effects should provide an estimate for the melting point of the target compound.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound 4-(cyanoacetyl)morpholine has several functional groups that influence its melting point. The morpholine ring, which is a heterocyclic compound, has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The cyano group is an electron-withdrawing group that can increase the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The acetyl group is an ester, which generally lowers the melting point compared to the corresponding carboxylic acid due to the lack of hydrogen bonding, estimated at -20 degrees Celsius. The overall effect of these groups is a net decrease in the melting point from the reference compound.\n##Prediction: 80.0\n\n##Prediction",
