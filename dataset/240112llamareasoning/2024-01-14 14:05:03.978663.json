    "Reason": "The base structure benzothiazole has a melting point of around 98\u00b0C. Each substituent on the core structure affects this melting point:\n- The tert-butyl group, being large and bulky, tends to increase the melting point significantly, approximately by +30\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.\n- The methyl group on the thiazole typically raises the melting point but to a lesser extent than the tert-butyl group, let's approximate it as +5\u00b0C owing to the smaller increase in size and less van der Waals interactions compared to tert-butyl.\n- The carboxylic acid functionality generally leads to a strong increase in the melting point because it can form hydrogen bonds and contribute significantly to crystal lattice stability, estimated to be around +25\u00b0C.\nCombining these effects should predict the overall melting point shift.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, thiazole has a melting point of around 90\u00b0C. \n- The tert-butyl group is a bulky substituent that can increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces, estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The methyl group attached to the thiazole ring is a small alkyl group that can slightly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The carboxylic acid group is a strong hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, which can significantly increase the melting point due to the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, estimated at +40\u00b0C. \n- The combined effect of these groups on the melting point is additive.\n##Prediction: 165.0\n##Reason",
