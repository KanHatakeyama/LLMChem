    "Reason": "The melting point of clometacin is affected by its functional groups and overall molecular structure. Starting with an indole base, which typically has a melting point of about 52 degrees Celsius, we then consider the additional functional groups. The carboxylic acid group present in clometacin is a strong hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, which should increase the melting point significantly, approximately by +80 degrees Celsius. The chlorophenyl group adds more to the molecular weight and increases the intermolecular forces due to its polarity, contributing an estimated +30 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group is an electron-donating group which often has a stabilizing effect on the conjugated system, potentially raising the melting point somewhat, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The ketone functional group can participate in intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, expected to add another +20 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the nitrile group can engage in dipole interactions and could raise the melting point by about +50 degrees Celsius due to its strong dipole and potential for hydrogen bonding. Adding all these contributions gives us a prediction.",
