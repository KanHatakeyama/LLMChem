    "Reason": "The target compound isophthalaldehyde consists of a benzene ring with two formyl groups (\u2013CHO) attached in the meta position. Benzene as the basic unit has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The formyl groups increase the melting point due to the introduction of greater molecular weight, additional rigidity, and the ability for carbonyl groups to engage in dipole-dipole interactions, enhancing the intermolecular forces. Furthermore, the meta substitution of the formyl groups may support a more crystalline and ordered structure, likely leading to a higher melting point. Quantitatively, if we estimate that each formyl group increases the melting point by approximately 41\u00b0C, we account for the influence of both formyl groups on benzene's base melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the aldehyde group (C=O) generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The additional methylene group (CH2) in the isophthalaldehyde structure contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but the effect is less pronounced than in larger rings due to the smaller molecular size. The actual value suggests that the incremental increase per -CH2- group is less than previously theorized.\n##Prediction: 70.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
