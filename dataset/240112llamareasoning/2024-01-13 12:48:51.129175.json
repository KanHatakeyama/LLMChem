    "Reason": "The target compound cyclododecene (trans) has a basic unit of a cycloalkane, which in this case can be compared to cyclododecane. The base value for the melting point of cycloalkane is influenced by the number of carbons, and the cyclododecane will have a certain melting point due to its 12-membered ring structure. Cyclododecane has a melting point of around 60.7\u00b0C. For cyclododecene, the introduction of a double bond (trans) will typically lower the melting point because it reduces the symmetry of the molecule and slightly weakens the intermolecular van der Waals forces due to less efficient packing. The reduction in melting point could be estimated at around -60\u00b0C for the effect of a trans double bond. Other factors that might influence the melting point are minimal in this case since there are no other functional groups present.",
