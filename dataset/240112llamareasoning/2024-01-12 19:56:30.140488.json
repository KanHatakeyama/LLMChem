    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of (1R,2s)-10,2-camphorsultam, we would examine its functional groups and structure. The base structure is the bicyclic ring system found in camphor, which by itself has a melting point of 176 to 178\u00b0C. The sultam group (a sulfonyl group bonded to an amine) is a strong polar, electron-withdrawing group, and it may increase melting point due to its potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, adding approximately +10\u00b0C. The tertiary butyl group adds steric bulk, which can increase melting point, but because it is nonpolar, the effect is likely weaker in this context; we could estimate it contributes a +5\u00b0C increase due to its steric bulk affecting the crystal lattice stability. These effects combined would lead to a prediction slightly higher than the base structure of camphor.",
