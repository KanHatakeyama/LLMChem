    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of meprobamate, we must consider the effects of the functional groups present in the molecule. The two carbamate groups (\u2013OC(=O)NR2) are capable of forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which would significantly increase the melting point. Each carbamate group might contribute an estimated increase of 80 degrees due to hydrogen bonding potential. However, the molecular structure also has a quaternary carbon (C)(C)C that could hinder close packing of the molecules and lower the melting point, potentially by 15 degrees. The ethoxy group (\u2013O\u2013CH2CH3) has a minimal impact on the melting point, maybe increasing it by 5 degrees due to a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The two methyl groups on the quaternary carbon as part of the isopropyl structure would have a small increase in melting point, perhaps by 10 degrees in total, due to increased molecular weight. Combining these effects, we have an increase of 160 degrees (2 carbamates at 80 degrees each) reduced by 15 degrees from the quaternary carbon's effect, plus 5 degrees from the ethoxy group, and 10 degrees from the methyl groups, leading to a net increase of 160 degrees from a base value for an alkane chain of a similar size, which might have a melting point around -100 degrees.",
