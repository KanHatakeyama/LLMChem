    "Reason": "The target compound (3Z)-2-[(5alpha,8xi,9xi,14xi,17beta)-17-hydroxyandrost-2-en-3-yl]-6-methylhept-3-enoic acid appears complex but let's break down the functional groups and their influences. The basic unit to consider could be androstane, which has a cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene core structure. This basic steroid structure is a rigid system of four fused rings which is not directly correlated to a simple molecule like benzene for direct comparison. The rigid structure and increased molecular weight typically lead to a relatively high melting point. However, we need to estimate the melting point based on known functional groups and compare their combined effects: \n- Hydroxyl group (OH) at C17: -5 typically contributes to stronger hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point. \n- Carboxylic acid group (CO2H): +40 is usually a strong contributor to higher melting points due to dimer formation and strong hydrogen bonding. \n- Methyl group at the hept-3-enoic acid chain: +5 typically has a minor effect of increasing melting point due to increased molecular weight and weak Van der Waals forces. \n- Double bonds in the hept-3-enoic acid chain and steroid nucleus: -10 may slightly decrease the melting point as they could reduce crystal packing efficiency. \n- Methyl groups on the steroid nucleus: +(3*5) since they slightly increase the molecular weight and may also hinder close packing. \nCombining these adjustments, if the basic androstane structure has an estimated melting point of 130 (a rough estimation for an average steroid nucleus's melting point), the adjustments would be: \n130 (base steroid) + 40 (carboxylic acid) - 5 (hydroxyl group) + 5 (methyl group in the chain) - 10 (double bonds overall) + 15 (methyl groups on steroid) = 175. However, since this compound is described as having a high degree of rigidity and multiple functional groups which enhance intermolecular forces, the actual melting point might be higher than this calculated value. Adjusting for these additional effects, we estimate that the actual melting point is likely to be around 200.",
