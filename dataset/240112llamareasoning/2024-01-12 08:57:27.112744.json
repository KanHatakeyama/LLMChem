    "Reason": "The base unit for 1-pentene is ethane, which has a melting point of -183. Each additional methylene (-CH2-) group in a straight-chain alkane raises the melting point by an average of 6 degrees due to the increase in molecular weight and surface area impacting the van der Waals forces. With three additional -CH2- units, this contributes to an increase of 18 degrees. The alkene bond (-C=C-) in 1-pentene compared to a single bond in ethane generally causes an increase in the melting point due to more restricted rotation around the double bond, which slightly enhances intermolecular forces. For predicting the impact of the alkene bond, a conservative estimate could be to add 5 degrees. Therefore, the cumulative addition will be 18 (for three -CH2- units) + 5 (for the alkene) to the base melting point of -183.",
