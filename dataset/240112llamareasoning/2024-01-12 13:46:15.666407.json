    "Reason": "The target compound is 2,2,3,4-tetramethylpentane, which is derived from pentane. The base molecule, pentane, has a melting point of around -130 degrees Celsius. Adding methyl groups generally increases the melting point, but due to the branching and the additional steric hindrance that these groups create, they will, in this case, have a lesser effect or potentially even lower the melting point due to decreased ability of the molecules to pack efficiently. Let's assign an average increase of about +2 degrees Celsius per methyl group due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but then also consider the effect of branching, which tends to decrease the melting point. Given that there is significant branching (four methyl groups), let's approximate a decrease of -3 degrees Celsius for the packing inefficiency.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pentane has a melting point of -130.5\u00b0C. \n- Each methyl group generally increases the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces and molecular weight. However, the effect of a methyl group on the melting point is not linear, and the increase is not the same for each methyl group. For a simple alkane like pentane, each methyl group might increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. \n- There are four methyl groups in 2,2,3,4-tetramethylpentane.\n##Prediction: -105.0\n##Reason",
