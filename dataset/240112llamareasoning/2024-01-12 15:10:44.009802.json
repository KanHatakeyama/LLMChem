    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The amino group is expected to significantly increase the melting point because it can participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding; this effect might be around +40 \u00b0C. The nitrile group also tends to increase the melting point due to its ability to act as an acceptor in hydrogen bonding and its strong dipole-dipole interactions. Let's estimate this effect to be about +5 \u00b0C. The overall increase should then be the combined effect of the amino and nitrile groups, which is approximately +45 \u00b0C when added to the base unit of benzene.",
