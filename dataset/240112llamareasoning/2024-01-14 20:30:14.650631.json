    "Reason": "Starting with the basic structure for the consideration is indole, which has a melting point of 52 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group to the indole typically raises the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and slightly increased van der Waals forces. The influence of a methyl group on an aromatic system can generally be estimated at around +20 to +30 degrees Celsius for the melting point. However, indole's nitrogen and its interaction with the methyl group contribute to an additional increase. Therefore, a conservative estimate could be an increment of around 40-45 degrees Celsius over the indole base.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit indole has a melting point of 55 degrees Celsius. The methyl group (-CH3) is an electron-donating group which can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces; this can be estimated as a +5 increase. The additional phenyl ring contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point; this can be estimated as a +10 increase. The presence of the nitrogen atoms in the indole ring allows for hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point; this can be estimated as a +15 increase. The combined effects of these functional groups suggest a higher melting point.\n##Prediction: 79.0\n\n##Prediction",
