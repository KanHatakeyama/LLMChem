    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of carboxylic acid (COOH) group can be expected to raise the melting point significantly because it can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, both within the same molecule (intramolecular) and with other molecules (intermolecular), and this effect could be on the order of +100 degrees Celsius. Each chlorine atom likely contributes to the melting point as well due to the increase in molecular weight and polarity which can enhance the lattice energy of the crystal, giving each around +20 degrees Celsius. However, since they are both ortho to the carboxylic acid, steric hindrance may somewhat reduce this effect. Therefore, we can estimate a slightly lower contribution from the chlorines, let's consider it as around +15 degrees Celsius per chlorine atom.",
