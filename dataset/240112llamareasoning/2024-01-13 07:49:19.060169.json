    "Reason": "The target compound contains several functional groups that influence its melting point. The bicyclic structure creates a rigid framework that generally raises the melting point due to the compound having a more defined crystal lattice, compared to acyclic compounds, this can be estimated to increase the melting point by +50 degrees. A carboxylic acid group typically raises the melting point through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, on average, by about +40 degrees due to dimerization in the solid state. An ester group is generally less capable of hydrogen bonding compared to a carboxylic acid and could be predicted to raise the melting point by +20 degrees as it still allows for some dipole-dipole interaction. Starting with a baseline for simple hydrocarbons near room temperature, around 25 degrees, we can add the effects of the functional groups.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, cyclohexane, has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the bicyclic structure (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane) increases the melting point due to the rigidity and planarity of the structure, which can be estimated at +50\u00b0C. \n- The methoxycarbonyl group (O=C(O)OC) is a polar group that can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. \n- The carboxylic acid group (COOH) is capable of strong hydrogen bonding, which can significantly increase the melting point; this effect can be estimated at +50\u00b0C. \n- The overall increase in molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure due to the bicyclic and the carboxylic acid group will further increase the melting point. \n##Prediction: 136.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
