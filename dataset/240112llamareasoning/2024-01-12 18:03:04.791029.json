    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is ethene (ethylene), which has a melting point of \u2212169.2 \u00b0C. Each additional methyl group increases branching, which typically decreases the melting point because it creates a less regular structure that packs less efficiently in a solid state. Alkenes also have weaker intermolecular forces compared to alkanes due to less effective overlapping of their orbitals caused by the geometry of the double bond. The effect of branching in alkanes is roughly \u221220 \u00b0C per methyl group for small alkyl branches.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethene (ethylene) has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. \n- Each methyl group generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. We can estimate each methyl group to raise the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of three methyl groups would add 60\u00b0C to the melting point of the base unit. \n##Prediction: -109.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
