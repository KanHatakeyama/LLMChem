    "Reason": "Cellobiose is a disaccharide made up of two glucose units linked via a \u03b2(1\u21924) glycosidic bond. The base unit of glucose has a melting point of approximately 146\u00b0C. With cellobiose, the additional glucose unit and the glycosidic linkage increase the molecular weight, which contributes to an enhanced intermolecular hydrogen bonding due to the multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups present on each glucose unit. This bonding typically increases melting points due to the additional energy required to break the intermolecular bonds during melting. Since we're dealing with a disaccharide, we can expect a significant increase from the monosaccharide's base melting point. We attribute an increase of ~47\u00b0C for the additional glucose unit's contribution to the melting point, due to hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, the beta linkage itself might contribute to a higher melting point compared to an alpha linkage due to the different three-dimensional structure it confers to the molecule, allowing for potentially better crystal packing and stability. Since this is a more subtle effect, we estimate an additional increase of about ~10\u00b0C. Therefore, the predicted melting point is calculated by adding these increases to the base melting point of glucose.",
