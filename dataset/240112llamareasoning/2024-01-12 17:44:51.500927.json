    "Reason": "The basic unit for N-decane is methane, which has a melting point of -182 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene (CH2) group in a linear alkane typically increases the melting point, as it increases the molecular weight and the van der Waals forces between molecules. For N-decane, which is a chain of ten carbon atoms, 9 additional CH2 groups are included from methane. The effect of each CH2 unit can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +17 degrees Celsius per unit. Thus, the calculation would be as follows: -182 + (9 * +17) as the estimated contribution from the CH2 units.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, decane, has a melting point of -30.5\u00b0C. Each additional methylene group (\u2013CH2-) in a saturated hydrocarbon chain increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The effect of each methylene group is estimated to be around +5 degrees Celsius. With N-decane having 10 methylene groups, the cumulative effect would be +50 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: -30.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
