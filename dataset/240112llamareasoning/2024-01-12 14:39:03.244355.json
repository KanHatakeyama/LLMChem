    "Reason": "The base structure of the compound is dibenzofuran with a melting point of approximately 82-83\u00b0C. The presence of five chloro (Cl) substituents, being electron-withdrawing and having increased van der Waals forces due to their size, will substantially raise the melting point. Each chloro substituent can increase the melting point by about 20-30\u00b0C due to enhanced intermolecular attractions and molecular rigidity. However, considering the diminishing effect of each subsequent chloro group on an already electron-deficient aromatic system, an increase of 20\u00b0C per chloro group is a conservative estimate.",
