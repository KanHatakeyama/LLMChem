    "Reason": "The target compound N-(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert-butyl ester can be viewed as a modified glycine ester. The basic unit, glycine, has a melting point of approximately 233\u00b0C. However, the presence of various functional groups and structural features will alter this value. A tert-butyl group is bulky, which generally increases melting point due to greater van der Waals interactions, we might estimate this increase to be around +20\u00b0C. The diphenylmethylene group introduces significant rigidity and a potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, which would substantially increase the melting point; however, it also increases the molecular weight, which could lead to a broader range of melting due to the increased size and complexity of the molecule. This group might contribute an increase of +90\u00b0C. The overall structure is also less polar than glycine, and the intramolecular hydrogen bonding possible in the glycine zwitterion is replaced by weaker intermolecular forces in this ester, which will lower the melting point compared to glycine. The decrease due to loss of strong polar interactions and hydrogen bonding might be around -229\u00b0C. When these effects are considered together, the predicted melting point would be considerably lower than that of the base glycine molecule.",
