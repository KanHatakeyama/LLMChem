    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of around 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group can significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and dimers; this can typically add about 100 \u00b0C to the melting point. The tert-butyl group adds steric bulk to the molecule, which can increase the melting point by improving the crystal packing efficiency in the solid state due to greater van der Waals interactions. While steric hindrance could reduce packing efficiency, the tert-butyl group's symmetrical structure likely offsets this effect. The overall increase due to the tert-butyl group is estimated to be about 55 \u00b0C. Therefore, the cumulative effect of these functional groups is estimated to be an increase of approximately 155 \u00b0C from the base structure of benzene.",
