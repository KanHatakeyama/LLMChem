    "Reason": "Starting with the base structure ethene (C2H4) which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C, we add the considerations for the functional groups present in prop-2-en-1-ol (allyl alcohol). Adding a hydroxyl (OH) group typically raises the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds: +40\u00b0C. The presence of the additional methylene (-CH2-) group, which increases the molecular weight and size, can also contribute to an increase in melting point: +10\u00b0C. However, the double bond in the prop-2-en-1-ol does not influence the melting point significantly compared to solely the presence of the alkane chain because the double bond\u2019s effect on the melting point is more subtle and can depend on molecular packing in the solid state.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethene (ethylene) has a melting point of -169.2 \u00b0C.\n- The hydroxyl group (-OH) generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which can be estimated at +40 \u00b0C.\n- The presence of the double bond (C=C) in the prop-2-en-1-ol structure slightly increases the melting point due to the rigidity it introduces, which can be estimated at +5 \u00b0C.\nAdding these together gives us the predicted melting point.\n##Prediction: -114.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
