    "Reason": "The basic unit here is butanone, which has a melting point of -86\u00b0C. The presence of two additional methyl groups increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which could raise the melting point. Each methyl group in this context might approximately raise the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. However, due to the steric hindrance of the two methyl groups being on the same carbon (quaternary carbon), this increase might be somewhat mitigated to around 15\u00b0C per methyl group.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, acetone, has a melting point of -94.7 degrees Celsius. \n- Each methyl group is expected to raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methyl group could contribute approximately +5 degrees Celsius. \n- The ketone group (C=O) is polar and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, which would further increase the melting point. This could add around +20 degrees Celsius. \n- The overall structure is more rigid and bulky due to the additional methyl groups, which could contribute to a higher melting point. This could add an additional +10 degrees Celsius. \n##Prediction: -44.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
