    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 5-bromo-2,4-di-(tert-butoxy)pyrimidine, we need to consider the influences of different functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit, pyrimidine, has a melting point of around 20-22 degrees Celsius. Each tert-butoxy group is expected to increase the melting point due to increased steric hindrance and molecular weight; let's assign a value of +15 for each tert-butoxy group. The bromo substituent is also a heavy atom compared to hydrogen and thus increases the molecular weight; we can estimate its effect on the melting point to be around +10. Since there are two tert-butoxy groups, their combined effect would be +30. Combining these effects, we get: Base pyrimidine: +20, Two tert-butoxy groups: +30 (2 * +15), Bromo substituent: +10, Total predicted increase: 20 + 30 + 10 = +60\u00b0C",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyrimidine has a melting point of around 20\u00b0C. \n- Tert-butyl groups: Each tert-butyl group is bulky and increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point due to more stable crystal lattice formation. The effect of each tert-butyl group can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. \n- Bromine atom: The presence of a bromine atom increases the molecular weight and the polarizability of the molecule, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. This can increase the melting point by about 10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two tert-butyl groups and a bromine atom on the same molecule will have a cumulative effect on the melting point.\n##Prediction: 70.0\n##Reason",
