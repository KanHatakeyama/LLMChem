    "Reason": "The molecular structure of lycopodine suggests several factors that would influence its melting point. The compound has a complex polycyclic structure that includes multiple ring systems, which would tend to raise the melting point due to the resulting rigidity and increased intermolecular forces. The carbonyl group generally increases the melting point due to its ability to form stronger dipole-dipole interactions, potentially around +40 to +50 degrees Celsius. However, there are also aliphatic chains and a tertiary butyl group, which may slightly lower the melting point due to their flexibility and lesser ability to pack efficiently, but this effect is probably minor in comparison to the rigid polycyclic structure. We expect the effects of the carbonyl group to dominate, and therefore predict an increase relative to a simple hydrocarbon with a similar molecular weight.",
