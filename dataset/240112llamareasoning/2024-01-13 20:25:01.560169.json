    "Reason": "The target compound, 4-hydroxybenzophenone, is composed of a benzophenone base structure with the addition of a hydroxy group. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of around 5.5 \u00b0C. When a carbonyl group is added to form benzophenone, the melting point significantly increases because carbonyl groups can form strong dipole-dipole interactions and have the potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which typically raises the melting point by roughly 100 \u00b0C. Adding a hydroxy group to the benzophenone also increases the melting point due to the ability of the hydroxy group to form hydrogen bonds, contributing an additional 30 \u00b0C to the melting point. Therefore, the total predicted increase due to both the carbonyl and hydroxy groups would be around 130 \u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The hydroxyl group (OH) is capable of strong hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. This effect might be estimated at +100\u00b0C. \n- The ketone (C=O) group also contributes to the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding with the OH group. This effect might be estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular structure is rigid and planar, which can increase the melting point due to better packing in the solid state. This effect might be estimated at +10\u00b0C. \nCombining these effects, we get a predicted value.\n##Prediction: 135.5\n\n\n#Problem",
