    "Reason": "The compound 3,4-dihydroxy-?-pentyl-benzenemethanol is structurally similar to phenol, with several additional substituents. Phenol has a melting point of 40.5 degrees Celsius. Each hydroxyl group (-OH) is known to significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to form strong hydrogen bonds; substituting hydrogen with two hydroxyl groups at the positions 3 and 4 of the benzene ring would be expected to raise the melting point substantially, we estimate each hydroxyl group on the benzene ring adds about +20. The pentyl group (-CCCCC) and the additional -OH group on the methylene bridge (C(O)H) typically increase molecular weight and provide more van der Waals interactions; this could be estimated to increase the melting point by an additional +10 for the pentyl group and +10 for the hydroxymethyl group due to both being alkyl chains that contribute to the increase in molecular weight, but the hydroxyl would contribute additionally with its hydrogen bonding capacity. Thus, the prediction is calculated by adding up all these contributions to phenol's melting point.",
