    "Reason": "Sulfluramid is a fluorinated compound with a sulfonamide group. Starting with a basic carbon chain, which has a low melting point around -30 to -20 degrees Celsius, we must then consider the effects of the functional groups. The perfluoroalkyl chain (multiple CF3 and CF2 groups) significantly increases the melting point due to the strong electronegative effect of fluorine atoms, creating a highly polar environment and strong intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole attraction) that require more energy to overcome. Each CF2 group increases the melting point by approx. +20 degrees, and each CF3 group by approx. +30 degrees, due to the additional fluorine providing more polar character. The compound has 9 CF2 groups and 2 CF3 groups. The amide group also contributes to an increase in the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. An amide group generally increases the melting point by +80 degrees. The sulfone group is electron-withdrawing and polar, which increases intermolecular attraction and raises the melting point by approximately +100 degrees. The overall prediction must consider the sum of these effects: -25 (base carbon chain) + (9 x 20) CF2 groups + (2 x 30) CF3 groups + 80 (amide group) + 100 (sulfone group).",
