    "Reason": "The structure of endo-norborneol can be dissected into a bicyclic norbornane backbone with a hydroxyl group attached. The bicyclic structure is rigid and has significant van der Waals interactions due to its relatively larger size compared to simple hydrocarbons, which elevates its melting point. The hydroxyl group is capable of forming hydrogen bonds, which can significantly increase the melting point. Basic norbornane has a melting point of around 85 C. The hydroxyl group typically adds around +50 to +80 C to the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding. Considering these factors, the hydroxyl group's effect on the melting point should lie in this range.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound endo-norborneol has a norbornane backbone with two methyl groups and a norbornyl side chain. The norbornane structure itself has a high melting point due to its rigid and planar structure, which allows for efficient packing in the solid state. The methyl groups add to the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which would increase the melting point. The norbornyl side chain adds more rigidity and planarity, further increasing the melting point. The norbornyl side chain is estimated to contribute an additional +20\u00b0C due to its larger size and increased rigidity. The methyl groups, each contributing +5\u00b0C, add to the overall molecular weight and van der Waals forces.\n##Prediction: 130.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
