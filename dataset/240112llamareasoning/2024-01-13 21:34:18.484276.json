    "Reason": "The basic unit for dl-proline can be considered as butanoic acid, which has a melting point of around -5\u00b0C. Each of the distinct functional groups will adjust the melting point of this basic structure. The secondary amine (part of the pyrrolidine ring in proline) introduces ring strain and hydrogen bonding capability, which significantly increases the melting point, I estimate by about +180\u00b0C. The conversion of a primary carboxylic acid to the secondary amide (part of the same pyrrolidine ring) further enhances hydrogen bonding and restricts rotation, increasing the melting point, estimated at an additional +30\u00b0C. The ring formation itself also limits molecular rotation and adds to the rigidity of the structure, which raises the melting point, and this might be estimated as an additional +10\u00b0C. Altogether, the cumulative estimated increase in melting point is +220\u00b0C when compared to butanoic acid.",
