    "Reason": "The target compound, 2-methyl-2-butenoic acid, is modified from butanoic acid which has a melting point of around -5 degrees Celsius. The addition of a methyl group typically raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and steric hindrance, which could be expected to increase the melting point by approximately +3 degrees Celsius. The alkene group, which causes less effective molecular packing due to its geometric shape, commonly lowers the melting point by about -5 degrees Celsius. However, the presence of the carboxylic acid group greatly increases the melting point because it allows for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which could increase the melting point by about +50 degrees Celsius. Considering these adjustments, the overall increase would be the sum: -5 (base) +3 (methyl) -5 (alkene) +50 (carboxylic acid) = +43 degrees Celsius.",
