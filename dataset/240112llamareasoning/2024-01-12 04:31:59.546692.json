    "Reason": "The basic unit for 3-aminorhodanine can be considered as rhodanine, which typically has a solid-state due to strong dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding. This is attributed to the presence of sulfur atoms and carbonyl groups, which are strong electron withdrawing groups and contribute to intermolecular attractions, stabilizing the crystal lattice. Rhodanine has a melting point around 175\u00b0C. The amino group at the 3-position could provide additional hydrogen bonding, potentially increasing the melting point, but its effect is limited as the molecule is still relatively small. The addition of an amino group to small molecules generally increases the melting point by +5 to +15\u00b0C due to enhanced hydrogen bonding. The estimated decrease due to flexibility of the molecule is not very significant as the main structure is still a rigid 5-membered ring, so the reduction would only be minor, approximately -5 to -15\u00b0C. Since there's no large alkyl side chain or other bulky substituent that would greatly disrupt the crystal packing, the estimated decrease due to the flexibility of the side chain is calculated modestly.",
