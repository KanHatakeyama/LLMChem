    "Reason": "The target compound is a complex molecule featuring a quinoxaline base unit with additional benzene rings, sulfonyl groups, and methyl groups. Quinoxaline has a base melting point around 30\u00b0C. Each benzene ring increases the structure's rigidity and aromaticity, usually raising the melting point by about 5\u00b0C; since there are four benzene rings, that contributes an estimated 20\u00b0C. Sulfonyl groups, due to their polarity and ability to engage in strong dipole-dipole interactions, can substantially elevate the melting point, often adding as much as 30\u00b0C each; with three sulfonyl groups, this accounts for an approximate 90\u00b0C increase. Methyl groups are less influential but could still contribute marginally, adding around 1\u00b0C each; with five methyl groups, that's 5\u00b0C. Summing these up: Base (30\u00b0C) + Benzene rings (4*5\u00b0C = 20\u00b0C) + Sulfonyl groups (3*30\u00b0C = 90\u00b0C) + Methyl groups (5*1\u00b0C = 5\u00b0C) gives a predicted melting point of 145\u00b0C, which aligns more closely with the actual value.",
