    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The functional groups we're considering for this compound are the methyl sulfone group and the bromine atom. The methyl sulfone group introduces significant polarity and potential for strong dipole-dipole interactions due to the presence of the sulfone (SO2) attached to a methyl (CH3) group, which can substantially increase the melting point. The bromine atom also contributes to the increase in melting point due to its relatively high atomic mass and ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions, but its effect is likely less than that of a sulfone group. Estimating the quantitative effects, the sulfone group might add approximately +90 degrees Celsius due to its strong polarity. The bromine atom, contributing to intermolecular forces, might add around +6.5 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Methyl sulfone group (SO2CH3): This group is polar and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, which typically raises the melting point. The sulfone group is also capable of hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. The effect of the methyl sulfone group might be around +50\u00b0C. \n- Bromine atom: Bromine is a large, heavy atom that can increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. The effect of a bromine atom might be around +20\u00b0C. \n##Prediction: 85.0\n\n##Prediction",
