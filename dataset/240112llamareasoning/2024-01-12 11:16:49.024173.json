    "Reason": "The compound (+/+)-ibuprofen consists of several functional groups which can affect the melting point. Benzene forms the basic structure with a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group generally increases the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding; this effect could add around +50\u00b0C to the melting point. Two isobutyl groups attached to the benzene ring would normally increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces; each isobutyl may contribute approximately +10\u00b0C. However, steric hindrance might limit the effective contribution from these groups. Given that ibuprofen is chiral and being considered as a racemate (+/+ indicating a racemic mixture), the melting point may be influenced by the formation of a less ordered crystalline structure. Racemic mixtures often have lower melting points than their pure enantiomers. However, quantitative estimates for the reduction due to racemization are not easy to provide as they are specific to each compound and how the different enantiomers pack in the solid state. Overall, the strong hydrogen bonding of the carboxylic acid group is likely the most dominant factor affecting the melting point.",
