    "Reason": "The basic unit, ethane, has a melting point of -182.8 degrees Celsius. Chlorination generally increases the molecular weight and polarizability of the molecule, which leads to stronger London dispersion forces and a higher melting point. However, the introduction of chlorine also introduces dipole-dipole interactions due to its electronegativity. This replacement typically increases the melting point by about +40 to +50 degrees Celsius.",
