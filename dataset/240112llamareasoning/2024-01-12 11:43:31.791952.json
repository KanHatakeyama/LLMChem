    "Reason": "The basic unit, methane, has a melting point of -182 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene (-CH2-) group in a straight chain alkane typically raises the melting point by approximately 20 degrees Celsius. Given that pentylamine has 4 additional methylene groups compared to methane, the increase would be 4 * 20 = +80 degrees Celsius from the baseline of methane. The amino (-NH2) group typically raises the melting point due to the capability of forming hydrogen bonds, which adds approximately +47 degrees Celsius compared to a similar alkane without the amino group.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, ammonia (NH3), has a melting point of -78.1\u00b0C. The addition of a pentyl group (C5H11) to the amine increases the molecular weight and size, which typically raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces: +20 (for the pentyl group). However, the increase in molecular weight and size also increases the flexibility of the molecule, which can lead to a decrease in the melting point: -5 (for the flexibility).\n##Prediction: -53.0\n\n##Prediction",
