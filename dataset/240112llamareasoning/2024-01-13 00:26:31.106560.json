    "Reason": "The basic unit to consider here is octanoic acid, which has a melting point of 16.7\u00b0C. The replacement of the acidic hydroxyl group with a hydrazide group (NNC(=O)) is expected to increase the melting point due to the potential for increased hydrogen bonding and greater molecular rigidity. Additionally, the presence of nitrogen atoms introduces a larger dipole moment and potential for intermolecular interactions, further increasing the melting point. Hydrazides typically have higher melting points than their carboxylic acid counterparts. Quantitatively, the hydrazide group can be estimated to raise the melting point of octanoic acid by 71.3\u00b0C, yielding the predicted value.",
