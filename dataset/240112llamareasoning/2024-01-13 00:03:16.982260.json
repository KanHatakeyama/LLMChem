    "Reason": "The target compound, p-chloronitrobenzene, consists of a base benzene ring which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) greatly influences the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature and ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which should increase the melting point significantly, estimated to be around +70\u00b0C. On the other hand, a chlorine substituent, also an electron-withdrawing group, impacts the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and enhancing the polarizability, with an estimated contribution of around +3\u00b0C. The combined effect of these substituents should be added to the base value of benzene to predict the melting point of p-chloronitrobenzene.",
