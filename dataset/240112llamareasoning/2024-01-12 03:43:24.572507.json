    "Reason": "The target compound, 1-Bromo-4-methylbenzene, has a benzene ring as its basic unit which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Adding a methyl group to a benzene ring typically has a mild effect on the melting point, and it can be estimated to raise the melting point due to the slight increase in molecular weight and steric hindrance, approximated at +3\u00b0C. Adding a bromine atom significantly increases the molecular weight and introduces stronger intermolecular forces through increased polarizability, which translates to a larger increase in the melting point. For bromine, the effect can be estimated at +18\u00b0C. Therefore, the combined effects of the methyl and bromine groups are predicted to increase the melting point of benzene.",
