    "Reason": "Starting with naphthalene, which has a melting point of 80.2 degrees Celsius, we need to consider the effect of the chloro substituent on the melting point. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) and it increases intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions due to its electronegativity. However, it also leads to a steric effect that might disrupt optimal packing, which would otherwise be beneficial for a higher melting point. Typically, adding a halogen like chlorine to an aromatic ring can increase the melting point by 20-40 degrees Celsius relative to its hydrogen counterpart due to the increased molecular weight and polarity. However, it seems like in the case of 2-chloronaphthalene, the disruption of crystal packing surpasses the increased intermolecular forces, therefore, the net effect is lesser.",

The effect of chlorine on the melting point is estimated to be -20\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 60.0\n##Reason",
