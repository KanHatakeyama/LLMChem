    "Reason": "The compound contains multiple functional groups that influence the melting point. The basic bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure has a cyclohexane ring, which typically has a melting point around 6\u00b0C. However, when fused with another ring and with the degree of saturation in the bicyclo structure, it tends to increase the rigidity and symmetry, likely raising the melting point. The phenyl groups generally add about 20 to 30\u00b0C each because of the increase in molecular weight and pi-pi interactions they can form, leading to a more ordered solid state structure. The presence of the nitro group also increases the melting point because of its strong electronegativity and the ability to form stabilizing intermolecular interactions, adding around 80 to 85\u00b0C. An amide bond typically contributes around 40 to 60\u00b0C due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. An ester bond might contribute to an increase of approximately 20\u00b0C, as they also have polar characteristics and the capability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions. The combined ketone groups contribute to an incremental increase of about 20 to 30\u00b0C each due to their polar carbonyl group which facilitates dipole-dipole interactions.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Base unit, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to its rigid, bicyclic structure and the ability to form hydrogen bonds. \n- Nitro group: +20 (introduces strong intermolecular forces due to its electron-withdrawing nature and potential for hydrogen bonding). \n- Phenyl groups: +20 (each phenyl group contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point). \n- Amide linkage: +30 (the amide group can form strong hydrogen bonds, increasing the melting point). \n- Ester linkage: +10 (the ester group can form dipole-dipole interactions, but its effect is less than that of the amide or carboxylic acid). \n- Methyl groups: +5 (each methyl group slightly increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but their effect is minor). \nCombining these effects, we predict a melting point higher than the base unit due to the strong intermolecular forces and rigid structure.\n##Prediction: 165.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
