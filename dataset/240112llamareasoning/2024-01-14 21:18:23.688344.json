    "Reason": "The basic structural unit in digoxin is the steroid nucleus, which has a high melting point due to the rigid, well-packed structure typical of steroid rings. Let's estimate the melting point based on various functional groups present in digoxin:\n- Steroid nucleus: High baseline melting point due to rigid structure. Let's estimate about 180\u00b0C as a starting point based on typical steroid compounds.\n- Five hydroxyl groups (-OH): Each hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds, increasing intermolecular interactions and melting point. We can estimate approximately +5\u00b0C for each hydroxyl group, resulting in +25\u00b0C collectively.\n- Three additional oxygen atoms in ether linkages: Ethers slightly raise the melting point due to polarizability. We can estimate about +2\u00b0C for each ether linkage, adding +6\u00b0C.\n- Two lactone rings: Lactones significantly increase the melting point due to rigid cyclic structure and potential for additional hydrogen bonding. Estimating about +15\u00b0C for each lactone ring gives us +30\u00b0C.\n- One additional secondary alcohol: Secondary alcohols tend to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, but less so than primary alcohols. Let's estimate an additional +5\u00b0C.\n- Two additional tertiary carbons: The increased steric bulk may slightly raise the melting point due to more van der Waals interactions. We can estimate +2\u00b0C per tertiary carbon for an additional +4\u00b0C.\n\nAdding all these modifications to the baseline estimation for the steroid nucleus gives a total increase of +70\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound Digoxin has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic unit we can consider is the steroid structure, which has a high melting point due to its rigid and planar structure. The presence of a lactone ring and multiple hydroxyl groups will further increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and polar interactions. The compound also contains a quaternary carbon center, which can contribute to the melting point through increased molecular rigidity and potential for additional hydrogen bonding. The presence of a tertiary amine and a tertiary carbonyl group may also contribute to the melting point through increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.\n##Prediction: 230.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
