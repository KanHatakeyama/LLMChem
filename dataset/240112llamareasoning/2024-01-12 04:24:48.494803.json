    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of (2Z)-3-methyl-4-phenylbutan-2-one semicarbazone, we consider the effects of various functional groups and structural features based on a reference compound. For the reference, we will use acetophenone which has a benzene ring with a ketone at the alpha position and has a melting point around 20 degrees Celsius. Each functional group contributes differently to the melting point:\n\n- Phenyl group: generally increases melting point due to pi-pi stacking interactions. We might consider this to add approximately +40 degrees to the melting point, similar to benzene to toluene shift.\n- Methyl group (attached to non-aromatic carbon): may increase the melting point slightly by increasing the molecular weight and providing more surface area for van der Waals interactions. This might add around +5 degrees.\n- Alkene group (the presence of a double bond): may cause either an increase or decrease depending on the isomerism; however, in this structure the double bond is not conjugated with the phenyl ring. Therefore, the effect might be minimal, around +0 to +5 degrees.\n- Semicarbazone (\u2013C(=O)NHNHC(=N)\u2013): introduces hydrogen bonding and significant rigidity to the structure, thus substantially increasing the melting point. The influence of this group could be around +60 to +70 degrees because of the strong intermolecular forces it introduces.\n\nAdding these contributions to the reference compound acetophenone, we get an estimated sum of increases of 105 to 120 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, butanone has a melting point of -85.6\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a phenyl group generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi interactions, estimated at +80\u00b0C. \n- The addition of a methyl group to the butanone structure typically raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +10\u00b0C. \n- The semicarbazone group is a complex functional group that can participate in hydrogen bonding and has a significant impact on the melting point. This effect is estimated at +100\u00b0C. \n- The overall structure is more rigid and planar due to the phenyl and semicarbazone groups, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the carbonyl group (C=O) in the semicarbazone can also contribute to the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n\nAdding these effects together gives us the predicted melting point.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n##Reason",
