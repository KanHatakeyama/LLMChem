    "Reason": "The compound o-nitroaniline consists of a benzene ring with an amino group (NH2) and a nitro group (NO2) as substituents. The base molecule, aniline, has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The electron-withdrawing nitro group in the ortho position relative to the amino group has two primary effects that alter the melting point. First, it increases intermolecular interactions due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which would be expected to substantially increase the melting point by around 80-90 degrees Celsius. Second, the ortho substitution creates steric hindrance, which disrupts the crystal packing and may lead to either increase or decrease in melting point depending on the specific structure and intermolecular forces. In this case, the increase due to enhanced intermolecular forces predominates. Adding the effect of the nitro group to the base value of aniline, we predict the melting point to be substantially higher.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, aniline has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. \n- Nitro group: +80 degrees Celsius (due to strong electron-withdrawing effect and increased polarity, which enhances intermolecular forces). \n- The presence of the amino group (NH2) in aniline already contributes to a higher melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. However, since the nitro group is already accounted for in the base aniline structure, we don't need to double-count this effect.\n##Prediction: 74.0\n##Reason",
