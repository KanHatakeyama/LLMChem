    "Reason": "Target compound: Carbon tetrachloride. The basic unit, methane, has a boiling point of -162 degrees Celsius. Each chlorine atom adds to the molecular weight significantly and also introduces dipole-dipole interactions due to their electronegativity. This would be expected to significantly increase the boiling point. Also, chlorine atoms replace hydrogen atoms which have very little intermolecular force contribution, thus the effect of adding chlorine is more pronounced. Estimating the impact of each Cl could be around +35 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, methane has a melting point of -182.5\u00b0C. \n- Each chlorine substituent on the methane molecule increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the polarizability of the molecule, which enhances intermolecular forces. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. \n- The presence of four chlorine atoms in carbon tetrachloride significantly increases the melting point compared to methane. \n- The molecule is symmetrical, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, further increasing the melting point. \n- The overall molecular weight and the presence of four chlorine atoms contribute to a higher melting point.\n##Prediction: -35.0\n##Reason",
