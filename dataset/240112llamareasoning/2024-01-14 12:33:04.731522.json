    "Reason": "The compound 4-Nitrobenzamide has several functional groups that contribute to its melting point. The benzene ring provides a base structure which contributes to higher melting and boiling points due to its planar and symmetrical structure. The amide group is capable of strong hydrogen bonding and adds significant rigidity to the molecule, raising the melting point. A single amide group typically contributes an increase of approximately +80 degrees Celsius due to these effects. The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and its presence increases the polarity and intermolecular forces within the compound, hence raising the melting point; it can be estimated to contribute around +50 degrees Celsius to the melting point. Combining these effects, we calculate the predicted melting point as follows.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. \n- Nitro group: +80 \u00b0C (strong electron-withdrawing group that can participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, significantly increasing the melting point). \n- Amide group: +100 \u00b0C (capable of strong hydrogen bonding, which can lead to a much higher melting point). \n- The combined effect of these functional groups should be additive.\n##Prediction: 185.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
