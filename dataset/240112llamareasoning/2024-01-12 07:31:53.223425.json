    "Reason": "The base structure for sulfadimethoxine is aniline, which has a melting point of around 6 degrees Celsius. For sulfadimethoxine, the following functional groups have been considered for their contributions to the melting point: - Two methoxy groups that are attached to the aromatic ring can increase the melting point due to additional van der Waals forces and slightly higher molecular complexity; each methoxy might contribute +20 degrees Celsius to the melting point. - A sulfonamide group is present, which contributes significantly to the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the presence of a highly polar sulfonyl group (SO2); this group may add approximately +120 degrees Celsius. - An additional aromatic ring increases the melting point through increased pi-pi stacking interactions, van der Waals forces, and molecular rigidity; this could add about +40 degrees Celsius.",
