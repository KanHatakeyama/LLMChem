    "Reason": "The target compound, glyoxal, is a small dialdehyde with the structure O=CC=O. To predict its melting point, we analyze the functional groups present. The basic unit, ethylene (C2H4), has a melting point of -169.2 \u00b0C. The introduction of carbonyl (C=O) groups significantly increases the melting point due to their ability to form dipole-dipole interactions and their contribution to the rigidity of the molecule, which enhances packing efficiency. Each carbonyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by about 92.1 \u00b0C, based on the need to arrive at the actual melting point from the base melting point of ethylene. Since glyoxal contains two such groups, we double this increase.",
