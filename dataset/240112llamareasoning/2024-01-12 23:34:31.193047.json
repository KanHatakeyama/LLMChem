    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Adding sterically bulky tert-butyl groups typically increases the melting point due to enhanced van der Waals interactions and reduced molecular mobility in the solid state; each tert-butyl may contribute around +30 degrees Celsius. The presence of the quinone structure introduces polar carbonyl groups that also raise the melting point due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions and increased molecular rigidity, this can contribute around +50 degrees Celsius due to the conjugation and the rigidity of the structure. Since there are two tert-butyl groups, the adjustment for tert-butyl groups is doubled. Summing these contributions: 5.5 (benzene) + 60 (two tert-butyl groups) + 50 (quinone structure), we get a total predicted increase.",
