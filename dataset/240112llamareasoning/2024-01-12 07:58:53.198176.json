    "Reason": "The compound 2-Ethoxyethyl acetate consists of an ester group (acetate) linked to an ether chain. The basic building blocks to consider are ethane and acetic acid. Ethane's melting point is -183\u00b0C and brings a low baseline melting point due to its small size and lack of polarity. Acetic acid has a relatively high melting point of 16\u00b0C due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. The ester function in 2-Ethoxyethyl acetate is not capable of hydrogen bonding like an acid but has some dipoles, which moderately increase the melting point, though not as much as free OH groups. The ether linkage will not significantly affect the melting point. The ethoxyethyl group adds molecular weight and steric bulk, which slightly raises the melting point. However, considering this is a flexible and relatively nonpolar molecule overall, the effects of these groups will be to keep the melting point lower than small polar molecules.",
