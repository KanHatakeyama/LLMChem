    "Reason": "Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of about 5.5\u00b0C. Each additional phenyl group adds about +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. The -NH2 (amine) groups collectively add about +80\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding capabilities and increased polarity. The bromine atom adds about +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The 1,2,4-triazine ring adds about +50\u00b0C because of its nitrogen heteroatoms which strongly influence the packing in the solid state and its potential for hydrogen bonding. These shifts are not simply additive but can give an estimated sum for predicting the melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Each phenyl group is expected to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi stacking interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C per phenyl group. \n- The bromine atom is a heavy halogen that can increase the melting point due to its high electronegativity and size, estimated at +15\u00b0C. \n- The triazine ring is a rigid structure that can increase the melting point due to its planarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +30\u00b0C. \n- The amine groups can form hydrogen bonds, which can significantly increase the melting point, estimated at +20\u00b0C for each amine group. \n- The overall molecular weight and the rigidity of the molecule will also contribute to an increased melting point. \n##Prediction: 195.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
