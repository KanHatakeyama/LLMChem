    "Reason": "The target compound 2-chloro-6-fluoro-beta-nitrostyrene consists of different functional groups added to a styrene base structure. The base styrene has an estimated melting point of around -30\u00b0C due to its vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. Each of the functional groups on the styrene ring will influence the melting point in different ways:\n\n- Chlorine substituent: This will generally increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and possible intermolecular interactions with its larger electron cloud. Let's estimate this increase: +40\u00b0C.\n\n- Fluorine substituent: While smaller in size compared to chlorine, fluorine is highly electronegative and will also contribute to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, potentially increasing the melting point by about +20\u00b0C.\n\n- Nitro group: This functional group substantially increases melting point due to its strong dipoles and ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, despite the compound not having hydrogens suitable for hydrogen bonding. Its effect can be substantial, possibly adding another +50\u00b0C to the base melting point of styrene.\n\nConsidering these additions, we can add the estimated effects together with the base melting point.",
