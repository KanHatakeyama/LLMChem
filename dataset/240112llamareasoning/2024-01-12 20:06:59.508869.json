    "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by both its molecular structure and the interactions between molecules. o-Nitrophenol consists of a benzene ring with a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a nitro (-NO2) group attached in the ortho position. Starting with benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C, we then account for the hydroxyl group, which forms strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. These bonds increase the energy required to go from solid to liquid, which typically raises the melting point significantly, potentially by around 50 degrees. The nitro group is both electron-withdrawing and adds steric bulk, which affects molecular packing and decreases intermolecular forces, thus potentially decreasing the melting point. Due to its ortho position, it also disrupts the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl group, further affecting the melting point in a negative direction, estimated to decrease it by about 10-15 degrees. Therefore, the effects of the hydroxyl and nitro groups in o-nitrophenol would likely balance out to give a melting point close to that observed.",
