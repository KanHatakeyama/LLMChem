    "Reason": "The basic unit for alkanes, methane, has a melting point of -182.5. For each additional carbon in a straight-chain alkane, the melting point tends to increase due to increased Van der Waals forces from the greater surface area. Each methylene unit (CH2) typically adds about 5 to the melting point. However, the introduction of a double bond in an alkene like pent-1-ene lowers the symmetry of the molecule and can slightly reduce the melting point due to less efficient packing in the solid state. For a double bond, this reduction might be around 5 to 10. Hence, starting from methane: -182.5 + (4 additional carbons * 5) - 5 for the double bond.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethene (ethylene) has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. \n- The addition of a methyl group to the pentane chain generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, the effect of a methyl group on the melting point of a hydrocarbon chain is not as significant as it is for aromatic compounds. For a simple alkane like pentane, the increase in melting point due to a methyl group is around +20\u00b0C. \n- Since pent-1-ene is a linear alkane, the effect of the methyl group is less pronounced compared to branched alkanes.\n##Prediction: -149.0\n##Reason",
