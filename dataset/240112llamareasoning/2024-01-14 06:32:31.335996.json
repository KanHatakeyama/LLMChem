    "Reason": "Starting with benzene as a basic unit, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a sulfone group (SO2) attached to the benzene ring tends to increase the melting point due to the introduction of polar characteristics and possible intermolecular hydrogen bonding; this could add roughly +80 \u00b0C. A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) typically raises the melting point significantly because of the potential for strong hydrogen bonding; this could contribute with an addition of roughly +70 \u00b0C. The ketone functional group (C=O) within the acyl side chain could raise the melting point by +10 \u00b0C due to polar interactions. Lastly, a methyl group attached to the benzene ring could add about +5 \u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Summing up all these effects: 5.5 (benzene) + 80 (sulfonyl) + 70 (carboxylic acid) + 10 (ketone) + 5 (methyl) gives a predicted total increase.",
