    "Reason": "The basic unit pyridine has a melting point of around -42 degrees Celsius. The amide functional group, which is -C(=O)N, typically increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and increased dipole moment. For small molecules, an amide group can increase the melting point significantly depending on its position and the molecule's overall structure. Given that amides can increase the melting point by approximately +100 to +150 degrees Celsius due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization of the amide bond, this effect can be expected here. Additionally, the substitution at the 2-position of the pyridine may further increase the rigidity of the molecule, contributing to a higher melting point.",
