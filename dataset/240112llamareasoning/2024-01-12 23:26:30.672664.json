    "Reason": "The compound (2E)-3-(4-methylphenyl)but-2-enoic acid has various functional groups that contribute to its melting point. The benzene ring serves as a base structure with a melting point around 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group significantly increases the melting point due to its potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and increased polarity, and the introduction of one could be expected to raise the melting point typically by 70 to 100 \u00b0C. A methyl group attached to the benzene ring likely increases the melting point, due to an increase in hydrophobic interactions and slight increase in molecular size, typically around 5 to 10 \u00b0C. A conjugated double bond with the benzene ring can also elevate the melting point due to the stabilizing effects of the extended pi electron system, and such conjugation could increase the melting point by 20 to 30 \u00b0C.",
