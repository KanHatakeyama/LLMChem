    "Reason": "Acetic acid consists of a methyl group attached to a carboxyl group (COOH). Starting from a base molecule like methane, which has a melting point of -182.5 degrees Celsius, the introduction of functional groups will substantially modify this value. The methyl group slightly increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and size. However, the significant change comes from the carboxyl group, which, due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, will substantially increase the melting point. For instance, formic acid (HCOOH), with one less carbon, has a melting point of 8.4 degrees Celsius. Estimating the influence of the methyl group as a small increment and the carboxyl group as a major increment due to hydrogen bonding and the associated dimer formation in acetic acid, we can predict the melting point.",
