    "Reason": "Starting with the basic structure for the consideration is indole, which has a melting point of 52 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group to the indole typically raises the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and slightly increased van der Waals forces. The influence of a methyl group on an aromatic system can generally be estimated at around +20 to +30 degrees Celsius for the melting point. However, indole's nitrogen and its interaction with the methyl group contribute to an additional increase. Therefore, a conservative estimate could be an increment of around 40-45 degrees Celsius over the indole base.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.\n- Indole ring: The presence of the indole ring significantly increases the melting point due to the presence of nitrogen in the ring, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking interactions. This could be estimated to increase the melting point by about 100\u00b0C.\n- Methyl group: The methyl group attached to the indole ring increases the molecular weight and size, which can lead to an increase in the melting point. This could be estimated to increase the melting point by about 5\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n\n\n#Problem",
