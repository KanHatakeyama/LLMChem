    "Reason": "The basic unit of cyclohexanone for camphor provides a starting melting point of about 6.5\u00b0C. Each isopropyl group attached to the molecule imparts steric hindrance and increases molecular weight; each isopropyl group could raise the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C, taking into account the large steric effect. The bicyclic nature of camphor greatly restricts molecular motion, which typically increases the melting point. This effect might be around +80\u00b0C owing to the fused ring structure creating a more rigid and less flexible molecule. While the ketone functional group does increase polarity and could contribute to higher melting points due to the dipole-dipole interactions, in camphor, this effect could be diminished due to the overall steric hindrance of the molecule. Therefore, the presence of the ketone group might only add an additional +5\u00b0C. Considering these group contributions, a predicted melting point for camphor can be calculated.",
