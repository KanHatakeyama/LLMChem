    "Reason": "The base unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Methaqualone has two phenyl groups which should add to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi stacking interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C total (+10\u00b0C each). The presence of an N=O group in the structure confers the ability for hydrogen bonding and adds rigidity to the molecule, which is expected to significantly raise the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The two methyl groups, one on each side of the quinazoline ring, likely raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions by about +5\u00b0C each (+10\u00b0C total). The quinazoline ring system itself is a rigid and planar structure, which contributes to strong pi-pi stacking and higher melting points; this might reasonably add another +25\u00b0C. The presence of nitrogen within the ring could slightly disrupt molecular symmetry, but its impact on the melting point may be minor, so no deduction is considered for this factor. Putting these estimates together yields an adjusted melting point.",
