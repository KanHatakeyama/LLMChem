    "Reason": "Quinoline-8-carboxylic acid combines a quinoline ring system with a carboxylic acid functionality. The baseline molecule benzene has a melting point of 5.5. The quinoline structure introduces more aromaticity and the possibility for additional intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding due to the nitrogen atom. This fused-ring system is significantly more rigid than benzene, which can lead to a higher melting point due to increased \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions and higher structural rigidity; this effect is estimated to contribute an additional +100 to the melting point. The carboxylic acid group is known for its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which usually result in a significant increase in melting point. An estimated increase of +90 can be attributed to the carboxylic acid group. These functional group contributions combined give a total estimated increase of 5.5 (baseline for benzene) + 100 (quinoline ring system) + 90 (carboxylic acid group).",
