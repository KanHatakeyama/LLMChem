    "Reason": "The target compound is mesitaldehyde, which is a derivative of benzene with three methyl groups and a formyl group attached to it. The basic benzene structure has a melting point around 5.5. The introduction of methyl groups generally increases the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces from the added hydrocarbon bulk. Each methyl group could contribute approximately +5 degrees to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric bulk. However, the attendance of a formyl group (-C=O) tends to lower the melting point because it is capable of forming a polar carbonyl which can interfere with the crystal lattice stability. This effect might be around -12.5 degrees subtracted from the overall melting point. Combining these effects for mesitaldehyde would look like this: Basic benzene: 5.5 + (3 methyl groups * 5) - (formyl group * 12.5) = 5.5 + 15 - 12.5.",
