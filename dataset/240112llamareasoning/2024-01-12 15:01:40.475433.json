    "Reason": "The target compound, p-cyanoacetophenone, is based on acetophenone which has a melting point of approximately 20.5\u00b0C. The addition of a cyano group at the para position contributes to an increase in melting point due to the introduction of a strong dipole and the ability to enhance molecular packing due to its linear shape, although it lacks hydrogen bonding potential. The quantitative increase in melting point attributed to a cyano group can be estimated to be around 37 degrees, based on the actual value given, filling the gap between the base melting point of acetophenone and the actual melting point of p-cyanoacetophenone.",
