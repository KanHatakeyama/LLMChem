    "Reason": "The compound iminodibenzyl can be considered as a biphenyl derivative with two key modifications: the addition of an ethylene bridge and a secondary amine group. For biphenyl, with a melting point of 71\u00b0C, the ethylene bridge introduces rigidity by restricting rotation, which usually increases the melting point. The increment from each -CH2- in the ethylene bridge might be estimated at around 5\u00b0C, resulting in an increase of 10\u00b0C. The secondary amine can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly elevates the melting point. However, an increase of 35\u00b0C for the introduction of a secondary amine group seems overestimated. A more conservative estimate would be 20\u00b0C for the secondary amine group, balancing the capacity for hydrogen bonding with the broader structural context of the molecule. Hence, the combined effect of the ethylene bridge and the amine group is predicted to be +30\u00b0C.",
