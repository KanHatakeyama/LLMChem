    "Reason": "The target compound has several functional groups: an ester (acetyl portion), an ether (thioether linkage), a diethylamino group, and a chloropyridazine ring. Acetyl groups typically raise the melting point due to the polar carbonyl group, which enables stronger dipole-dipole interactions; we can estimate this contributes to an increase by about +40 degrees. Thioethers slightly raise the melting point over alkanes due to increased molecular weight and mild polarity, estimated at +10 degrees. Diethylamino groups have a pair of nitrogen atoms capable of hydrogen bond accepting, which again can raise the melting point; estimated at +25 degrees. Chlorinated aromatic rings have higher melting points due to increased molecular weight and introduction of a polar substituent, estimated at +10 degrees. However, due to steric hindrance between the groups and the overall non-planar structure, which hampers effective packing, the melting point could be lower than the sum of these effects. Thus, we might adjust our estimate downwards somewhat, assuming a slight offset of -10 degrees.",
