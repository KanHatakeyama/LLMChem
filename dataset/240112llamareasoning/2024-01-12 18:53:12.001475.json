    "Reason": "To predict the melting point quantitatively, we look into the effects of individual functional groups and the overall molecular structure of 4-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1',3'-dihydrospiro[cyclohexane-1,2'-inden]-5'-ol, compared to a reference compound. The reference compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C:\n- Indene structure: +50\u00b0C due to the rigid, polycyclic aromatic structure that increases intermolecular forces.\n- Cyclohexane ring: +20\u00b0C since the spirocyclic linkage creates a more complex, less symmetric structure that hinders molecular motion, raising the melting point.\n- Tertiary-butyl group: +30\u00b0C for the steric hindrance and the increase in molecular weight and size.\n- Phenol group: +25\u00b0C due to the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point.\nSumming these adjustments, we predict the melting point for the compound.",
