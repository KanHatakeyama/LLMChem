    "Reason": "The basic structural unit, ethane, has a melting point of -183.3 degrees Celsius. Each bromine substituent is expected to add approximately +57 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and polarity. Each chlorine substituent adds approximately +37 degrees Celsius for the same reasons. Adding two bromines results in an upwards shift of +114 degrees Celsius, and adding two chlorines results in an upwards shift of +74 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethane has a melting point of -172. The presence of bromine atoms generally increases the melting point due to the larger atomic size and stronger van der Waals forces, which can be estimated at +40 per bromine atom. \n- Chlorine atoms also increase the melting point due to their larger atomic size and polarizability, which can be estimated at +30 per chlorine atom. \n- The presence of two bromine atoms and two chlorine atoms will increase the melting point significantly. \n- The molecule has a symmetrical structure, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, potentially increasing the melting point. \n- The molecule has a branched structure, which can disrupt the crystal lattice and lower the melting point. However, the effect of branching is not as significant as the effects of the halogens. \n- The overall effect of the bromine and chlorine atoms is expected to be additive, but the branching may slightly reduce the overall increase.\n##Prediction: -10.0\n##Reason",
