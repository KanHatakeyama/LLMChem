    "Reason": "The compound 4-Nitrobenzamide has several functional groups that contribute to its melting point. The benzene ring provides a base structure which contributes to higher melting and boiling points due to its planar and symmetrical structure. The amide group is capable of strong hydrogen bonding and adds significant rigidity to the molecule, raising the melting point. A single amide group typically contributes an increase of approximately +80 degrees Celsius due to these effects. The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and its presence increases the polarity and intermolecular forces within the compound, hence raising the melting point; it can be estimated to contribute around +50 degrees Celsius to the melting point. Combining these effects, we calculate the predicted melting point as follows.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group that can form intermolecular interactions, which typically increases the melting point. This effect can be estimated at +80\u00b0C. The amide group can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. This effect can be estimated at +100\u00b0C. The presence of the nitro group and the amide group together would lead to a substantial increase in the melting point.\n##Prediction: 195.0\n\n##Prediction",
