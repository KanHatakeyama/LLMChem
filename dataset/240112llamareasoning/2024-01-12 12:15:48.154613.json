    "Reason": "Starting with propanoic acid, which has a melting point of -21 degrees Celsius, the addition of a bromine atom can heavily influence the melting point. Bromine, being a large and heavy halogen, will increase the molecular weight significantly and strengthen Van der Waals interactions. The resultant increase in intermolecular forces usually results in a significant increase in the melting point. A bromine atom typically adds approximately +50 to +70 degrees Celsius. Given that bromine is also quite electronegative, it's possible that it may contribute to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. Considering the actual melting point of 62.5 degrees Celsius, it appears the effect of bromine on the melting point is towards the higher end of the typical range for halogens. So, the increase due to the bromine atom should be formulated as an adjustment from the typical range to match the actual value.",
