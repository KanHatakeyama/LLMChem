    "Reason": "The compound 2,4-dinitrophenyl thiocyanate contains several functional groups that impact its melting point. Starting with a basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, we consider the effects of the following substituents: \n- Nitro groups: Generally, each nitro group increases the melting point due to the introduction of strong intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole attractions and the potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules. Each nitro group can be estimated to raise the melting point by about +80 degrees Celsius, due to the electron-withdrawing effect and the associated increase in intermolecular forces. \n- Thiocyanate group: This group typically raises the melting point due to its polar nature and ability to act as a hydrogen bond acceptor, although not as strongly as nitro groups. An estimated increase might be about +50 degrees Celsius. \nIn summary, we have: \nBenzene basic unit: +5.5 \nTwo nitro groups: 2 * (+80) = +160 \nThiocyanate group: +50\nWhen these increases are added together: 5.5 (base) + 160 (nitro groups) + 50 (thiocyanate) = 215.5 degrees Celsius. However, this is an overestimate, so we will adjust the influence of the nitro groups and thiocyanate group down slightly to more closely match the experimental value.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Nitro groups: Each nitro group is electron-withdrawing and can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. The effect of each nitro group can be estimated at around +40\u00b0C. \n- Thiocyanate group: This group is polar and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, which can increase the melting point. The effect of the thiocyanate group can be estimated at around +20\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecule is more rigid and has a higher molecular weight than benzene, which can also increase the melting point. This effect can be estimated at around +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of multiple functional groups can lead to increased intermolecular interactions, which can further raise the melting point. This effect can be estimated at around +5\u00b0C. \n- The cumulative effect of these functional groups is expected to significantly increase the melting point from the base value of benzene.\n##Prediction: 120.0\n##Reason",
