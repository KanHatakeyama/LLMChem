    "Reason": "Meloxicam has several functional groups that affect its melting point. The basic structure can be considered as a thiazole attached to a benzene ring. Thiazoles have a typical melting point of around 90-100\u00b0C, but attachment to a benzene ring and additional functional groups can significantly alter this. The carboxylic acid derivative (COOH) greatly increases melting points (usually by more than 100\u00b0C due to strong hydrogen bonding). Meloxicam has a related acyl group (CO-N) instead of a direct COOH, but it still allows for hydrogen bonding, so a large increase in melting point is expected, though somewhat less than for COOH. The sulfonamide (S(=O)2NH) group is also strongly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, likely contributing a significant increase of about 50-80\u00b0C. The methyl group (CH3) attached to the thiazole slightly raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight, but by a smaller margin, likely 5-10\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of aromatic rings and the presence of a sulfonamide group are expected to significantly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The sulfonamide group is particularly large and polar, which could contribute an increase of around 100-150\u00b0C. The presence of a tertiary butyl group is expected to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance, contributing an additional 10-20\u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group is expected to increase the melting point due to increased polarity, contributing an additional 5-10\u00b0C. The cumulative effect of these functional groups will be to significantly increase the melting point of the base benzene structure. The expected influence of each substituent is based on common tendencies observed in functional group chemistry.\n##Prediction: 260.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
