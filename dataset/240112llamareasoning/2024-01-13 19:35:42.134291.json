    "Reason": "The target compound is a complex molecule incorporating a variety of functional groups that affect its melting point. The base structure can be considered as a combination of a cyclic amine (pyrrolizine) and multiple ester linkages, as well as a hydroxyl, methoxy, and tertiary butyl groups. Starting with a simple cyclic amine like pyrrolidine, which has a melting point of approximately -63 degrees Celsius, we begin adjustments for the additional functional groups. Adding ester linkages can increase the melting point significantly due to their polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, approximately +80 to +100 degrees Celsius per ester group. The presence of hydroxyl and methoxy groups could also increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and polarity; hydroxyl groups typically add around +50 degrees Celsius, and methoxy groups around +10 degrees Celsius. The tertiary butyl group with its branching can hinder close packing, slightly reducing the melting point by around -5 to -10 degrees Celsius. With these considerations, we calculate: -63 (base amine) + 160 to 200 (two ester groups) + 50 (hydroxyl group) + 10 (methoxy group) - 5 to -10 (tertiary butyl group) = 152 to 197 degrees Celsius. However, considering that this structure is complex and the multiple groups could interact differently, we should estimate a lower range to account for structural constraints, leading to a predicted melting point closer to the lower end of the calculated range.",
