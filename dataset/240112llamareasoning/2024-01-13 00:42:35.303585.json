    "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of around 42 \u00b0C. The introduction of an amino group can lead to increased hydrogen bonding, significantly raising the melting point by approximately +80 \u00b0C. Each chloro substituent will contribute to a higher melting point due to increased molecular weight and enhanced van der Waals interactions; this effect is estimated at about +25 \u00b0C per chloro group. Taking into account these substituent effects without considering the potential disruptiveness of the chloro groups on the overall symmetry and crystal packing, which are harder to predict quantitatively without detailed analysis.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyridine has a melting point of around 110\u00b0C. \n- Chloro substituents: Each chloro group is electron-withdrawing and increases the polarity of the molecule, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each chloro group is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C. \n- Amino group: The amino group can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. The amino group is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 40\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two chloro groups and an amino group on the same molecule will have a synergistic effect on the melting point.\n##Prediction: 170.0\n##Reason",
