    "Reason": "The basic unit, propane, has a melting point of -187.7\u00b0C. Each chloro group in a compound elevates the melting point due to increased molecular weight and the resultant increased Van der Waals forces. A single chloro group can raise the melting point of a compound by approximately +45\u00b0C. Since there are two chloro groups in 1,2-dichloropropane, the total expected increase is about +90\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, propane has a melting point of -187.7\u00b0C. \n- Each chloro group is electron-withdrawing and increases the polarity of the molecule, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each chloro group is expected to increase the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two chloro groups will have a cumulative effect on the melting point.\n##Prediction: -107.0\n##Reason",
