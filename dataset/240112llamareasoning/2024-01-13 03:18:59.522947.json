    "Reason": "The structure of propionaldehyde (CCC=O) suggests its melting point is influenced by the following factors: \n\n- Basic unit, ethane (ethane as the simplest alkane similar in size to the non-functional part of propionadehyde), has a melting point of -183\u00b0C. \n- The addition of a carbonyl group (C=O) typically increases the melting point due to polar nature and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions which is giving us a positive increment. \n- The exact effect of the carbonyl group on the melting point isn't standardized, but let's estimate this effect to be around +100\u00b0C due to its significant impact on polarity compared to a simple alkane.\n\nSo, we would expect propionaldehyde to have a higher melting point than ethane but still a low melting point due to its relatively small size and lack of strong intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding.",
