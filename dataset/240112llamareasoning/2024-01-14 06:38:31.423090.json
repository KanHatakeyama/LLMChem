    "Reason": "The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of about 41\u00b0C. Each methyl group, due to increased molecular weight and hydrophobic character, will raise the melting point; this increase is estimated to be +20\u00b0C per methyl group because they also hinder the packing of molecules reducing intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The presence of an iodine atom, which is a large, heavy substituent, will raise the melting point even more due to increased Van der Waals forces and possible London dispersion forces; this is estimated as +45\u00b0C for iodine. The hydroxyl group's effect is included in the baseline for phenol since it's the fundamental functional group of the compound.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Base structure, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Iodine substituent: large, heavy atom that increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point significantly. Estimated effect: +80\u00b0C. \n- Methyl groups: each adds steric bulk and increases the molecular weight, raising the melting point. Estimated effect for each methyl group: +5\u00b0C. \n- Hydroxyl group: capable of strong hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point. Estimated effect: +40\u00b0C. \nTotal estimated increase: 80 (for iodine) + 10 (for each methyl group) + 40 (for hydroxyl group) = 130\u00b0C. \n##Prediction: 130.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
