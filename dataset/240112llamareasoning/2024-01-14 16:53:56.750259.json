    "Reason": "The basic unit, methane, has a melting point of -182.5 degrees Celsius. Each chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and the intermolecular van der Waals forces. The presence of three chlorine atoms also adds polarity to the molecule. We can estimate the melting point shift due to each chlorine atom to be approximately +40 degrees Celsius. Thus, the addition of three chlorine atoms would increase the melting point by approximately +120 degrees Celsius.",
