    "Reason": "The compound dl-menthol consists of a cyclohexane ring, three methyl groups, one secondary alcohol group, and one isopropyl group. The basic unit, cyclohexane, has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of methyl groups usually raises the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces; however, the increase is likely smaller than +5 degrees Celsius for each as menthol has a complex, branched structure that may not allow each methyl group to contribute equally to van der Waals interactions. A more conservative estimate might be +2 degrees Celsius for each methyl group. The secondary alcohol group forms hydrogen bonds, which substantially increases the melting point. The effect can be estimated at around +15 degrees Celsius. The isopropyl group contributes bulk and increases the molecular weight, but given the branched nature of dl-menthol, it may add to steric hindrance which could disrupt efficient packing. Nonetheless, it could contribute with a moderate increase, estimated at +3 degrees Celsius, given that the steric hindrance may lower the overall impact on the melting point when compared to the straight-chain alkanes. Therefore, considering these more measured contributions for each substituent, the combined effects should raise the melting point from the base value of cyclohexane.",
