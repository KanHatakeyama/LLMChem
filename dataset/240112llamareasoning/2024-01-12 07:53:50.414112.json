    "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit, hexane, which has a melting point of -95.3 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group (C=O) in hexan-2-one increases the melting point because it introduces stronger dipole-dipole interactions than the C-C and C-H interactions in alkanes, due to the polar nature of the C=O bond. However, hexan-2-one does not have the ability to form hydrogen bonds like alcohols or carboxylic acids, which limits the increase in melting point. Given that the carbonyl group typically increases the melting point by about +20 to +40 degrees Celsius in comparison to similar nonpolar compounds, we should consider a moderate increase. Assuming the influence of the carbonyl group increases the melting point by an intermediate value of +30 degrees Celsius from the base value of hexane, we will predict the melting point accordingly.",
