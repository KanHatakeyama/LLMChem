    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison here is phenanthrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) that consists of three fused benzene rings, which has a melting point around 101\u00b0C. The methylene bridge (-CH2-) in 4,5-methylenephenanthrene introduces additional rigidity to the PAH structure. Increased rigidity typically raises the melting point since the molecules can pack more orderly and resist melting. For the -CH2- group, we can estimate an increase of approximately +13\u00b0C due to increased molecular stiffness and possibly some additional van der Waals interactions.",
