    "Reason": "The target compound 4-amino-3-nitrobenzonitrile is made up of a benzene ring as the basic unit with three substituents: an amino group (-NH2), a nitro group (-NO2), and a nitrile group (-C#N). Each of these functional groups has its own effect on the melting point. The benzene ring has a characteristic melting point around 5.5 degrees Celsius. The amino group is known to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point significantly, estimated as a +80 increase. The nitro group is also a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can further increase the melting point due to strong intermolecular attractions, adding about +60. The nitrile group is polar and may contribute to solid-state interactions, but its influence on the melting point is less pronounced than that of amino and nitro functional groups, estimated as a +15 increase. Combining these effects, the sum impact should result in a significantly increased melting point from the basic benzene unit.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The functional groups present in 4-amino-3-nitrobenzonitrile include a nitrile group, an amino group, and a nitro group. Each of these groups will influence the melting point as follows:\n\n- Nitrile group: The presence of a nitrile group generally increases the melting point due to its ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions and its linear shape, which can facilitate crystal packing. We assign an increase of +20 degrees for the nitrile group.\n\n- Amino group: The amino group can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly raises the melting point. We assign an increase of +40 degrees for the amino group.\n\n- Nitro group: The nitro group is highly electronegative and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, further increasing the melting point. We assign an increase of +30 degrees for the nitro group.\n\nAdding these increments to the base melting point of benzene gives the predicted melting point of the target compound.\n##Prediction: 150.0\n\n\n##Prediction",
