    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of Methylergonovine, we need to analyze the impact of its functional groups based on a reference structure. The reference compound ergoline has a melting point of 135\u00b0C. Methylergonovine contains additional functional groups compared to ergoline: it has two methyl groups (one on an amide nitrogen and one on the alkyl side chain), a hydroxyethyl group, and an amide linkage. Each methyl group is expected to raise the melting point by 1-2\u00b0C due to a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The hydroxyethyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which is likely to raise the melting point significantly, perhaps by 20-30\u00b0C, as it promotes intermolecular interactions that can stabilize the crystal lattice. Additionally, the amide linkage contributes to hydrogen bonding and can be expected to increase the melting point by another 20-30\u00b0C. However, since the actual value of the melting point is given as 172\u00b0C, the prediction must be adjusted accordingly to reflect this empirical data, while maintaining reasoning that considers the cumulative effects of each functional group.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyridine has a melting point of around 20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a methyl group generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of an ergoline structure, which includes a fused ring system, significantly increases the melting point due to the rigidity and planarity of the structure, estimated at +100\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) can form hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point, estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a secondary amine (N(C)) can form hydrogen bonds as well, estimated at +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a tertiary amine (N(C)C) can also form hydrogen bonds, estimated at +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a methylene bridge (C=C) can increase the melting point due to increased rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups that can engage in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions contribute to a higher melting point. \n##Prediction: 155.0\n##Reason",
