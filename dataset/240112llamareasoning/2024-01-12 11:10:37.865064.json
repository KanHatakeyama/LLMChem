    "Reason": "The compound L-menthol has a basic cyclohexane structure, which has a melting point of around 6.5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group typically increases the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, which would add about +30\u00b0C. Each of the three isopropyl groups would add steric bulk, which hinders close packing, but their alkyl nature can increase van der Waals forces slightly, thereby increasing the melting point. The individual isopropyl might contribute around +5\u00b0C each. Overall, the stereochemistry of L-menthol and the presence of a hydroxyl group stabilizes the crystalline structure, increasing the melting point substantially.",
