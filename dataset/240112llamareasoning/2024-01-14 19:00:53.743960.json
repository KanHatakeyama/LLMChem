    "Reason": "The target compound is a derivative of adenine (a purine base) with two additional ethoxy groups. The basic adenine unit which consists of a fused imidazole and pyrimidine ring has a relatively high melting point due to its planar aromatic structure and extensive hydrogen-bonding capabilities. An unsubstituted adenine has a melting point of around 360\u00b0C. Each ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) contributes to a lower melting point due to the introduction of aliphatic character and increase in conformational flexibility. One ethoxy group could conceivably lower the melting point by approximately -85.5\u00b0C, being derived from halving the difference between the predicted melting point and that of unsubstituted adenine. This effect is consistent with the principle that aliphatic ethers generally decrease the melting point when added to a rigid aromatic system.",
