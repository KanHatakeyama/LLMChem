    "Reason": "The parent structure, benzoic acid, has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius. The addition of the isopropyl group to the aromatic ring generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for van der Waals interactions, however, it also introduces steric hindrance which disrupts the planarity and packing efficiency of the molecules in the solid state. This can slightly lower the melting point compared to unsubstituted benzoic acid. Considering these effects, the isopropyl group's influence will be approximated as a net decrease of about 3 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of an isopropyl group (\u2212CH(CH3)2) will increase the melting point due to the added molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The effect of the isopropyl group can be estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group (\u2212COOH) is capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. The effect of the carboxylic acid group can be estimated at around +100\u00b0C. The cumulative effect of these groups will be the sum of their individual contributions.\n##Prediction: 135.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
