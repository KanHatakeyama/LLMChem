    "Reason": "The target compound benzonitrile consists of a benzene ring and a cyano group (-C\u2261N). For benzene, the melting point is 5.5 \u00b0C. The cyano group is an electron-withdrawing group, which increases the strength of intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole interactions due to its polarity, thus typically raising the melting point. However, its linear shape can make it less effective at solid-state packing compared to bulky groups. Therefore, its contribution to the melting point might be slightly negative. We can estimate this contribution conservatively as -20\u00b0C taking into account the increase in intermolecular forces balanced by less efficient packing.",
