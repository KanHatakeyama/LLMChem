    "Reason": "Basic unit, pyrazole, typically has a melting point in the range of 70 to 100 degrees Celsius. The amino group (-NH2) generally increases the melting point due to the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, potentially adding +20 to +50 degrees. The nitrile group (-C\u2261N) is electron-withdrawing and can also participate in dipole-dipole interactions, potentially adding +10 to +30 degrees. Each group's effects might not be simply additive due to potential intramolecular interactions, but for this estimation we'll consider an additive model.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyrazole, has a melting point of around 70\u00b0C. \n- The amino group (-NH2) can form hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point by about 80\u00b0C. \n- The cyano group (-C#N) is a strong electron-withdrawing group that can increase the melting point due to its ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at an increase of about 20\u00b0C. \n- The nitrile group also contributes to the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at an increase of about 10\u00b0C. \n- The overall effect of these functional groups is an increase in the melting point. \n##Prediction: 180.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
