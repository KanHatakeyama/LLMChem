    "Reason": "The target compound is based on a tetrahydroquinoxaline core, which already has a substantial molecular structure that promotes intermolecular interactions, increasing the melting point. Specific contributions are:\\n- Tetrahydroquinoxaline base: Assumed base value around 100 due to its bicyclic nature and nitrogen atoms that can engage in hydrogen bonding.\\n- Methoxybenzylidene: +10 due to additional aromaticity and possible dipole-dipole interactions afforded by the methoxy group.\\n- Two 4-methylphenylsulfonyl groups: Each group would add around +20 due to increased van der Waals interactions from the bulky sulfonyl and methyl groups, and enhanced rigidity of the molecule.\\nTotal predicted shift: 10 + 2*(20) = +50\\n",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, quinoxaline, has a melting point of around 20 degrees Celsius. \n- Each methoxybenzylidene group is expected to increase the melting point due to the addition of aromaticity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius per group. \n- Each sulfonyl group is expected to increase the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature and potential for intermolecular interactions, estimated at +30 degrees Celsius per group. \n- The presence of two phenyl rings and the rigidity of the molecule will also contribute to an increased melting point, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius for the additional phenyl rings and +5 degrees Celsius for the rigidity. \n- The overall molecular weight and the presence of multiple aromatic rings will also contribute to an increased melting point, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius for the molecular weight and +5 degrees Celsius for the aromatic rings. \n- The presence of the tetrahydroquinoxaline core will also contribute to an increased melting point due to the rigidity and planarity of the structure, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. \n- The cumulative effect of these functional groups and structural features is expected to result in a significant increase in the melting point.\n##Prediction: 140.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
