    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. A bromine atom, being a large, electron-withdrawing group, typically raises the melting point significantly due to increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular interactions (+60 \u00b0C). The trifluoromethyl group is highly electronegative and also increases the melting point due to the polar nature of the C\u2013F bonds and the additional fluoro substituents' influence on the solid-state lattice (+40 \u00b0C). Lastly, the sulfonamide group adds substantial polar character and ability to form hydrogen bonds, leading to a strong increase in the melting point (+80 \u00b0C). The combined effect of these groups on benzene is expected to give a substantial cumulative increase in the melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a sulfonamide group (\u2013SO2NH2) is expected to significantly increase the melting point due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions it can engage in, estimated at +100 \u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group (\u2013CF3) is highly electronegative and contributes to the polarity of the molecule, which can also increase the melting point, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. The bromine atom is a large halogen that can increase the melting point due to its high atomic weight and polarizability, estimated at +30 \u00b0C. The presence of three fluorine atoms in the trifluoromethyl group also increases the molecular weight and polarity, estimated at +10 \u00b0C each.\n##Prediction: 195.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
