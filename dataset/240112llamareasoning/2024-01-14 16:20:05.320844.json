    "Reason": "The compound phthalonitrile includes a benzene core which normally has a melting point of approximately 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two nitrile groups significantly influences the melting point. Nitrile groups are strong dipoles and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, thus substantially raising the melting point. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitrile groups increases the rigidity of the molecule, further contributing to a higher melting point. The quantified effect of each nitrile group, based on similar compounds and considering these interactions, might be approximately 67.25\u00b0C (which when added to the benzene baseline and multiplied by two gives the closest approximation to the actual melting point).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The phthalonitrile group consists of two nitrile (C#N) groups and a benzene ring. The nitrile groups are highly polar and can form strong dipole-dipole interactions, which typically increase the melting point significantly. Each nitrile group can be estimated to contribute an increase of about 40-50 \u00b0C due to these interactions. The ortho positioning of the nitrile groups may slightly reduce the melting point due to steric hindrance, but this effect is minor. The overall increase due to the nitrile groups is estimated to be around 80-90 \u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 135.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
