    "Reason": "The target compound, (2E)-3-(2-aminophenyl)-2-(4-aminophenyl)prop-2-enoic acid, incorporates several functional groups that influence its melting point: two phenyl rings, two amino groups, and a carboxylic acid group. Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, the introduction of each phenyl group can increase the melting point due to the added molecular weight and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions; the increase can be estimated at about +25\u00b0C per phenyl ring. The amino groups are capable of forming hydrogen bonds, resulting in a significant increase in the melting point; each amino group can be estimated to add about +40\u00b0C due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The carboxylic acid group, being a strong hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, likely adds around +50\u00b0C, due to the potential for extensive hydrogen bonding. Finally, the conjugated double bond in the prop-2-enoic backbone contributes additional rigidity to the molecule, which may modestly increase the melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C. To this extent, the contributions for each group are added together to predict the overall melting point shift from benzene: 5.5 (benzene) + 25 (phenyl) + 25 (phenyl) + 40 (amino) + 40 (amino) + 50 (carboxylic acid) + 5 (conjugation).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Each amino group (NH2) can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. Amino groups can add approximately +80\u00b0C each due to hydrogen bonding. \n- The carboxylic acid group (COOH) can form strong hydrogen bonds and dimerize, which can further increase the melting point. The carboxylic acid group can add approximately +100\u00b0C due to these effects. \n- The conjugated double bond (C=C) in the prop-2-enoic acid part of the molecule can increase the rigidity of the molecule, which can also raise the melting point. This effect can be estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two amino groups and one carboxylic acid group in the same molecule will have a synergistic effect on the melting point due to the potential for additional hydrogen bonding and dimerization. \n- The overall molecule is quite large and rigid, which can also contribute to a higher melting point. \nCombining these effects, the predicted melting point is calculated by adding the effects of each functional group to the base value of benzene.\n##Prediction: 205.0\n##Reason",
