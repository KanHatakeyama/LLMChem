    "Reason": "Indole-3-carbonitrile consists of an indole moiety and a cyano (nitrile) group. Starting with indole as the base structure, which has a melting point of around 52\u00b0C, the introduction of different functional groups will alter the melting point. The benzene portion of the indole confers rigidity and planarity, which leads to strong intermolecular pi-pi stacking interactions, raising the melting point relative to aliphatic compounds. The pyrrole-like nitrogen in the indole introduces hydrogen bonding capability, which can increase the melting point. Finally, the nitrile group is highly polar and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, which significantly increases the melting point. Therefore, the cyano group will provide the most substantial increase in melting point, due to its strong dipole and potential to form polar interactions with neighboring molecules. The prediction also must consider the overall molecular symmetry and potential for forming a crystalline lattice, which is favorable in indole-3-carbonitrile.\n- Indole base: +52\n- Cyano group: +128 (strong dipole-dipole interactions and increase in molecular weight)\n- Other considerations such as hydrogen bonding and pi stacking are included in the base indole melting point increment.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The indole structure has a fused ring system, which generally increases the melting point due to the rigidity of the molecule. This can be estimated as an increase of approximately +100 \u00b0C. The nitrile group (-C\u2261N) is polar and can form dipole-dipole interactions, which can increase the melting point by about +20 \u00b0C. The presence of the amino group (-NH2) can form hydrogen bonds, which can significantly raise the melting point, estimated at +40 \u00b0C. The indole structure also has a nitrogen atom in the ring, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and contribute to the melting point, estimated at +10 \u00b0C. The overall prediction is the sum of these effects.\n##Prediction: 165.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
