    "Reason": "The structure of conessine is a complex polycyclic alkaloid, which includes a number of different functional groups, including tertiary amines (CN(C)), several cyclohexane rings, and a cyclopentane ring. For the purpose of predicting the melting point, the following considerations are taken into account: \n(1) Basic polycyclic skeleton: Since the compound is a polycyclic alkaloid, the rigidity and the number of rings are expected to largely increase the melting point. Polycyclic compounds often possess significantly higher melting points compared to their acyclic analogs due to interlocking of the ring structures in the solid state which provides greater lattice energy. \n(2) Amino groups: Tertiary amines present in the structure could be associated with lower melting point compared to secondary or primary amines due to the steric hindrance, but the impact might be minimal due to their internal position within the rings. \n(3) Branched structure: The multiple branches and the inherent chiral centers in the structure might lead to more stable and tightly packed crystal lattices, subsequently increasing the melting point. \nTo summarize, the complex polycyclic nature of the compound will significantly raise the melting point while the effect of the tertiary amines will be relatively minor.",
