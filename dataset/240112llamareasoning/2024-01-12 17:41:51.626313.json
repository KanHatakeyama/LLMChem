    "Reason": "The basic unit to consider is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of substituents generally increases the melting point due to the increased symmetry and the possibility of additional intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. For this compound, we have the following substituents: \n- Nitro groups (\u2013NO2): Each nitro group significantly raises the melting point due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect which stabilizes the crystal structure through intermolecular attraction; this can be estimated at around +80\u00b0C per nitro group for the impact on the melting point. \n- Hydrazine group (\u2013NHNH2): This group can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds which can further raise the melting point, estimated at around +40\u00b0C. \nAdding these effects to the base melting point of benzene gives the predicted melting point of the compound.",
