    "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-furoic acid is furan, which has a melting point of -85.6 \u00b0C. The introduction of a carboxylic acid group (COOH) to the furan significantly increases the melting point, due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +215.6 \u00b0C. No additional functional groups are present that significantly shift the melting point further.",
