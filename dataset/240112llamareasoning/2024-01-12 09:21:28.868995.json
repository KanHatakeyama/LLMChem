    "Reason": "The basic unit benzene has a melting point of 5.53\u00b0C. The influence of the carbonyl group (C=O) usually increases the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, and it can be roughly estimated to add about +25\u00b0C. The hydroxylamine group (NHOH) attached to the carbonyl will further increase the melting point significantly because it can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen, and it also increases the capability for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The hydroxylamine group can contribute approximately +55\u00b0C. We must also consider that the conjugation of the benzene ring with the carbonyl group may slightly elevate the melting point as well due to increased molecular stability. This effect may add around +5\u00b0C.",
