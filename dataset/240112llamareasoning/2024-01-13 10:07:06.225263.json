    "Reason": "4-phenoxyaniline consists of a benzene ring with two substituents: an aniline (NH2) group and an ether linkage to another benzene ring (phenoxy). Aniline itself has a melting point of around -6 degrees Celsius, which is primarily due to the presence of the amino group that introduces polarity and the possibility of hydrogen bonding, although the benzene ring raises it compared to aliphatic amines. The phenoxy group introduces another ring which increases the molecular weight and rigidity of the molecule, raising the melting point. However, since the ether linkage is flexible and does not greatly affect the potential for intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonding, its effect is less than that of the amino group. Taking benzene's melting point to be 5.5 degrees Celsius as a reference, we might estimate the amino group to raise the melting point significantly due to hydrogen bonding (by approximately +60 degrees Celsius), and the ether linkage to another benzene ring to add more due to increased molecular weight and rigidity (by approximately +20 degrees Celsius), taking into account that both substituents are para to each other which may lead to some symmetry and higher crystallinity.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, aniline, has a melting point of around -6 degrees Celsius. \n- Phenoxy group: The phenoxy group is a large, rigid structure that can increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces and potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. This could add approximately +50 degrees Celsius. \n- Amino group: The amino group can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly raises the melting point. This could add around +30 degrees Celsius. \nThe predicted value is the sum of these contributions.\n##Prediction: 84.0\n\n\n#Problem",
