    "Reason": "The base structure of alkanes (e.g., octane C8H18) has a melting point around -57\u00b0C. Octanal has an aldehyde functional group which creates a small dipole, allowing for stronger intermolecular forces than alkanes but weaker than alcohols. For the aldehyde group, this could increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C. However, the overall effect on the melting point might be less than predicted due to the linear structure and large carbon chain which tend to decrease molecular compactness and intermolecular forces.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, octane, has a melting point of -57.2\u00b0C. \n- The aldehyde group (-CHO) typically increases the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. This could contribute an estimated +20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a double bond in the alkyl chain (octane) would slightly increase the melting point due to the rigidity it introduces, but this effect is less pronounced than in longer chains. We can estimate this at +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular weight and van der Waals forces would also increase the melting point, but this effect is already accounted for in the base unit of octane. \n##Prediction: -32.0\n\n\n#Problem",
