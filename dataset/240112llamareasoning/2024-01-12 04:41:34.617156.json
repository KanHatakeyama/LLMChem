    "Reason": "The compound 2-Ethoxyethyl acetate consists of an ester group (acetate) linked to an ether chain. The basic building blocks to consider are ethane and acetic acid. Ethane's melting point is -183\u00b0C and brings a low baseline melting point due to its small size and lack of polarity. Acetic acid has a relatively high melting point of 16\u00b0C due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. The ester function in 2-Ethoxyethyl acetate is not capable of hydrogen bonding like an acid but has some dipoles, which moderately increase the melting point, though not as much as free OH groups. The ether linkage will not significantly affect the melting point. The ethoxyethyl group adds molecular weight and steric bulk, which slightly raises the melting point. However, considering this is a flexible and relatively nonpolar molecule overall, the effects of these groups will be to keep the melting point lower than small polar molecules.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethyl acetate has a melting point of -85.6\u00b0C. \n- Ethoxy group: +20\u00b0C (due to increased molecular weight and polarity, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions). \n- Methyl group: +5\u00b0C (due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces). \n- The presence of the ethoxy group and the methyl group will increase the melting point due to the added molecular weight and polarity. However, the overall molecule is still relatively small and non-polar, which may limit the increase in melting point.\n##Prediction: -59.0\n##Reason",
