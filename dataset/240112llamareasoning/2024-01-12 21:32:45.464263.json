    "Reason": "The basic unit here is ethane, which has a melting point of -183\u00b0C. When we add functional groups, the melting point is affected by several factors: (1) the hydroxyl (-OH) groups increase hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point, (2) the carbon-bromine (C-Br) bonds add polarizable mass, which modestly increases the melting point due to increased London dispersion forces, but also (3) the increased molecular weight and size could reduce symmetry, which might lower the melting point as compared to a more compact molecule. Each hydroxyl group might add approximately +100\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding, and each C-Br could add about +50\u00b0C due to increased mass and London dispersion forces. Thus, the total increase in melting point could be estimated by: 2*(Hydroxyl effect) + 2*(C-Br effect).",
