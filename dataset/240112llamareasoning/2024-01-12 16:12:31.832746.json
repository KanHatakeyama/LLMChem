    "Reason": "The compound N(alpha)-boc-l-glutamine is a derivative of the amino acid glutamine. Glutamine itself has a melting point of about 183\u00b0C. However, the melting point is affected by the functional groups present in the compound. The Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) group adds steric bulk and hydrophobic character, which tends to increase the melting point by strengthening van der Waals interactions. This group is large, which typically contributes significantly to an increase in melting point, estimated at around +50\u00b0C. Furthermore, the additional amide linkage in the compound can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which would typically increase the melting point. The contribution of an amide bond could be approximated at around +5\u00b0C due to the potential for additional hydrogen bonding. Conversely, the modification of glutamine with these substitutes can disrupt the crystal packing, which generally lowers the melting point. This disruption might account for a large decrease in the melting point, estimated at about -120\u00b0C. When considered together, these effects result in a predicted melting point lower than that of glutamine, but higher than room temperature due to the stabilizing effects of the Boc group and additional amide bond.",
