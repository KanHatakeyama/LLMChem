    "Reason": "The starting point for predicting the melting point of midodrine is to choose a basic unit. Phenol, which is structurally similar to the aromatic part of midodrine, has a melting point of 41\u00b0C. From there, we can consider the effects of functional groups and substituents in midodrine:\n- Methoxy groups (\u2013OCH3): Two methoxy groups are expected to increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding interactions. We can estimate this effect as +20\u00b0C for each methoxy group.\n- Hydroxyethyl group (\u2013CH2CH2OH) on the aromatic ring: Hydroxyl groups generally increase melting points due to hydrogen bonding. Attached to a larger moiety, the effect might be a bit less than in simpler molecules. Estimating this at +15\u00b0C.\n- Carboxamide group (\u2013C(=O)NH2): This group significantly raises the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability of the amide bond, estimated at +80\u00b0C.\n- Methyl group attached to the nitrogen (-NCH3): This can increase the melting point slightly due to added molecular weight, estimated at +5\u00b0C.\n- Secondary amine (-NHC-): Secondary amines have a lower hydrogen bond donating ability compared to primary amines or amides, so this might lower the melting point relative to an amide, but in the presence of an amide, it's merely a modest increase in molecular weight, estimated at +5\u00b0C.\n\nSumming up all the predicted changes gives us an overall predicted melting point for midodrine.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two amide groups (C(=O)N) contributes to the melting point through hydrogen bonding and resonance stability, each amide group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 80\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two hydroxyl groups (OH) also contributes to the melting point through hydrogen bonding, each hydroxyl group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 40\u00b0C. \n- The presence of an ether linkage (CO) may slightly increase the melting point due to the polar nature of the oxygen, but this effect is generally less pronounced than that of hydrogen bonding, so it can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a methyl group (CH3) attached to the benzene ring can slightly increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, this can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 5\u00b0C. \n- The overall structure of the molecule, including the rigidity and planarity of the benzene ring and the conjugation of the aromatic system, can also contribute to a higher melting point, but this effect is difficult to quantify. \n- The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that can interact with each other, which can lead to a higher melting point than the sum of the individual contributions.\n##Prediction: 205.0\n##Reason",
