    "Reason": "The molecule 4-hydroxy-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine-2-thiol includes multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. Starting from a reference melting point of the basic pyrimidine unit, let's say approximately 20-30\u00b0C, the presence of the functional groups modifies it as follows:\n- Hydroxy group (-OH): The capacity to form hydrogen bonds results in a significant increase in melting point, estimated at around +100\u00b0C for hydroxy substitions on aromatic heterocycles.\n- Trifluoromethyl group (-CF3): The strong electronegative effect of fluorine and the increased molecular weight due to the three fluorine atoms add substantial rigidity to the molecule, contributing an estimated increase of about +50\u00b0C to the melting point.\n- Thiol group (-SH): Capable of hydrogen bonding and providing additional van der Waals forces, comparable to the hydroxy group, but with a less pronounced effect due to the lower electronegativity of sulfur compared to oxygen, contribute an estimated +70\u00b0C.\nThe cumulative effect of these groups leads to the predicted melting point.",
