    "Reason": "Starting with the basic structure for the consideration is indole, which has a melting point of 52 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group to the indole typically raises the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and slightly increased van der Waals forces. The influence of a methyl group on an aromatic system can generally be estimated at around +20 to +30 degrees Celsius for the melting point. However, indole's nitrogen and its interaction with the methyl group contribute to an additional increase. Therefore, a conservative estimate could be an increment of around 40-45 degrees Celsius over the indole base.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The indole structure introduces a fused ring system, which generally increases the melting point due to the rigidity and planarity of the structure, as well as the potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. This could be estimated to add around +80 to the melting point. The methyl group is an electron-donating group, which can slightly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the slight increase in van der Waals forces. This might add around +5 \u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 85.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
