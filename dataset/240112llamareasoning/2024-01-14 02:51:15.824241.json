    "Reason": "Base structure is analogous to a diphenylmethane which has a melting point around 27\u00b0C. The following functional group additions and structural characteristics will modify this base value: \n- Two phenyl rings: +30\u00b0C each for increased pi-pi stacking and van der Waals interactions\n- Thioamide group: +80\u00b0C for increased hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization\n- Hydrazono group: +40\u00b0C for additional hydrogen bonding and rigidity in the structure\n- Aminomethylidene groups: +30\u00b0C for hydrogen bonding and increased rigidity\n- 2-methyl substitution on one of the phenyl rings: +5\u00b0C for slight increase in van der Waals interactions and molecular weight\n- E-Configuration (trans-configuration) of the double bond might lead to a more stable and rigid structure, which could raise the melting point, but given that the effect is diffused across the entire molecule and stability contributions from double bonds are already considered within other functional groups, its individual contribution might be negligible for melting point prediction. Thus, it is not quantitatively included.\n\nThe sum of these adjustments results in an estimated melting point of 207\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The compound contains several functional groups that will affect the melting point: \n- Amino groups (NH2): Each amino group can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. We can estimate an increase of +40\u00b0C for each amino group. \n- Thioamide group (C=S): This group is polar and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise the melting point. We can estimate an increase of +30\u00b0C for the thioamide group. \n- Hydrazone linkage (NN=C-): This group can also engage in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. We can estimate an increase of +20\u00b0C for the hydrazone linkage. \n- Phenyl groups: The additional phenyl groups will increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. We can estimate an increase of +10\u00b0C for each additional phenyl group. \n- Methyl group: The methyl group attached to the phenyl ring will slightly increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. We can estimate an increase of +5\u00b0C for the methyl group. \n- The overall structure of the molecule is complex and rigid, which can lead to a higher melting point due to better packing in the solid state. This effect is difficult to quantify but can be estimated to add another +20\u00b0C. \nAdding these effects together gives us the predicted melting point.\n##Prediction: 205.0\n\n\n",
