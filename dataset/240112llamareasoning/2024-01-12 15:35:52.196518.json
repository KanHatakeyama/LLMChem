    "Reason": "The base unit for 4-pyridinealdoxime is pyridine, which has a melting point of 115.5\u00b0C. The oxime group (C=NOH) tends to increase the melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding capability (+20\u00b0C). However, the conjugation effect of the -CH=NOH group potentially reduces the melting point slightly (-4\u00b0C) due to stabilizing the planar structure and delocalizing electrons which might make the crystal lattice less rigid. Hence, the predicted shift would be an increase of roughly 16\u00b0C from the base pyridine melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyridine has a melting point of around 110\u00b0C. \n- The aldoxime group (-C=NOH) is a polar functional group that can form hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point. The effect of the aldoxime group on the melting point can be estimated to be around +50\u00b0C due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. \n- The presence of the aldoxime group also introduces some rigidity to the molecule, which can further increase the melting point. This effect can be estimated to be around +20\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecule is symmetrical and has a planar structure, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, further increasing the melting point. This effect can be estimated to be around +10\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 140.0\n##Reason",
