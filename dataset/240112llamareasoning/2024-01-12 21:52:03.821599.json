    "Reason": "The basic unit, aniline, has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. Halogens generally increase the melting point due to their high electronegativity and ability to engage in stronger van der Waals interactions. Chlorine, being electronegative and capable of engaging in stronger intermolecular attractions, is expected to raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Iodine is larger and much heavier than chlorine, which adds significant van der Waals interactions, potentially raising the melting point by around +25 degrees due to its substantial contribution to the molecular weight and polarizability. Together, these effects from chlorine and iodine sum to an increase of +45 degrees Celsius. However, the actual value is lower than the predicted value if we sum these changes directly, indicating a possible stabilizing intramolecular interaction between the halogens and the amino group that may mitigate the elevation in melting point. Considering a slight adjustment down for this stabilizing effect, the total predicted increase due to the substituents might be reduced to around +35-40 degrees Celsius.",
