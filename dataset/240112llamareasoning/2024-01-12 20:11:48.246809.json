    "Reason": "The base structure of the compound is similar to the steroid backbone, which has a melting point around 150 due to its rigid four fused rings system. Hydroxyl groups (-OH) generally increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. There are two hydroxyl groups in the given compound, which could raise the melting point by approximately 20\u201410 for each group. However, due to the presence of the conjugated diene system within one of the rings, there might be additional rigidity and possible pi-pi interactions which could slightly raise the melting point above the expected additive effect of the hydroxyl groups. Considering these factors, an estimate of additional 3 increment due to the conjugated system is predicted.",
