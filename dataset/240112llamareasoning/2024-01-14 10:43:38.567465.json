    "Reason": "The basic unit for hydrocarbons is alkanes, and a typical alkane (like octane) has a melting point around -57 degrees Celsius. However, the steroid structure of cortexolone introduces several factors that increase the melting point significantly:\n- Ring structure: Steroids have four fused carbon rings which greatly increases melting point due to the rigid structure providing high degree of molecular order (+200 degrees).\n- Hydroxyl groups (-OH): Each hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds, raising the melting point. Cortexolone has two hydroxyl groups, and each can be estimated to contribute roughly +20 degrees to the melting point (+40 degrees).\n- Carbonyl groups (C=O): There is one ketone in the A ring and one in the C ring of cortexolone. Each ketone group generally raises the melting point due to polar nature and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +30 degrees per group (+60 degrees).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.\n- The presence of a large steroidal structure with multiple rings and functional groups will significantly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for strong intermolecular interactions such as pi-pi stacking and van der Waals forces. Estimated increase: +150 \u00b0C.\n- The presence of a ketone group (C=O) can increase the melting point due to the polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding, but the effect is not as pronounced as in smaller molecules. Estimated increase: +5 \u00b0C.\n- The presence of two hydroxyl groups (OH) can significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which stabilizes the crystal lattice. Estimated increase: +20 \u00b0C.\n- The presence of a carboxylic acid group (COOH) can increase the melting point due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and dimerize, which can lead to a more ordered crystal lattice. Estimated increase: +30 \u00b0C.\nCombining the effects of these functional groups, we should expect a much higher melting point than benzene.\n##Prediction: 210.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
