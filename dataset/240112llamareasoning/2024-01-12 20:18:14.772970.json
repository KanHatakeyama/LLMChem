    "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-bromo-4-chloroaniline is aniline, which has a melting point of around -6\u00b0C. Substituting hydrogen with a bromine atom generally increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size, providing more Van der Waals forces; this can contribute approximately +40\u00b0C. The chloro group, being smaller than the bromo group, has less of an effect but still increases the melting point due to its electron-withdrawing nature, which leads to stronger intermolecular forces; this might contribute around +20\u00b0C. Lastly, the interaction between the amine group and the halogens may also result in stronger hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions, adding potentially another +10\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is aniline, which has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The introduction of substituents on the aromatic ring will affect the melting point. The bromine atom is a large halogen that increases the molecular weight and provides significant van der Waals interactions, which can increase the melting point by approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom is also a large halogen, but it is smaller than bromine, so it might contribute less to the melting point, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of two substituents on the aromatic ring increases the rigidity of the molecule, which can also raise the melting point, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 76.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
