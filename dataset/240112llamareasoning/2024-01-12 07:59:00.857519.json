    "Reason": "Basic unit: Pyrimidine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione has a melting point estimated at ~220\u00b0C due to strong hydrogen bonding and rigid structure. Addition of an aryl hydrazone (phenylhydrazono group): +30\u00b0C due to increased molecular complexity and potential intermolecular interactions. Methoxy group on the phenyl ring: +15\u00b0C, as alkoxy substituents increase the molecular weight and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions. Therefore, each functional group increases the melting point cumulatively.",
