    "Reason": "The target compound, 4-chloromandelic acid, is based on a benzene ring, which has a reference melting point. Each substituent on the benzene ring affects this melting point. For predicting the melting point of 4-chloromandelic acid, we need to consider the following effects: - Benzene: base value for melting point. - Chloro group: it is an electron-withdrawing group that will increase the melting point by enhancing the rigidity of the molecule through its inductive effect. Typically, this could contribute an increase of about +40 to +50 \u00b0C. - Hydroxyl groups (two of them): they form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, significantly raising the melting point. Each hydroxyl group can contribute roughly +50 to +60 \u00b0C. - Carboxyl group: also contributes to hydrogen bonding and increases the melting point, similar to a hydroxyl group, approximately +50 to +60 \u00b0C. However, since the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are on the same carbon, they interact with each other, and thus their individual contributions might not be fully additive.",
