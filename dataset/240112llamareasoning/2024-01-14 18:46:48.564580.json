    "Reason": "The target compound is 2,3,3',4,4',6-hexachlorobiphenyl, which consists of a biphenyl structure with six chlorine substituents. The biphenyl base structure has a melting point of approximately 70 Celsius. Chlorine substituents should, in general, increase the melting point of a compound through a combination of increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. However, the increment suggested earlier of 10 Celsius per chlorine atom appears too high given the actual melting point of 107 Celsius. A more reasonable estimate would be to consider a smaller increment per chlorine since the increased molecular weight and intermolecular forces might not scale linearly due to steric hindrance and possible interference between chlorine atoms. A revised estimate might be closer to 6 Celsius increase per chlorine atom: 6 Cl atoms x 6 Celsius/Cl atom = 36 Celsius increment.",
