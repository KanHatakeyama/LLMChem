    "Reason": "The basic unit in cyclohexane is a saturated carbon ring structure without any double bonds or functional groups. Alkanes have relatively low melting points because of their non-polar nature and weak van der Waals forces. The six-membered ring structure of cyclohexane tends to give it a slightly higher melting point compared to its open-chain analogue, hexane, due to better packing in the solid state. However, since there are no additional functional groups present to significantly enhance intermolecular forces, we should not expect a large deviation from the general range of melting points for similar sized alkanes.",
