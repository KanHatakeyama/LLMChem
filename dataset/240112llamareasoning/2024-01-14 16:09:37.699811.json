    "Reason": "The basic unit here is butanone, which has a melting point of -86\u00b0C. The presence of two additional methyl groups increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which could raise the melting point. Each methyl group in this context might approximately raise the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. However, due to the steric hindrance of the two methyl groups being on the same carbon (quaternary carbon), this increase might be somewhat mitigated to around 15\u00b0C per methyl group.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, butan-2-one, has a melting point of around -80 degrees Celsius. The addition of two methyl groups to the butan-2-one structure increases the molecular weight and provides more van der Waals interactions, which typically raises the melting point. Each methyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by +5 degrees. The presence of the keto group (C(=O) group) also contributes to an increase in the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. This effect is estimated to be +20 degrees.\n##Prediction: -55.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
