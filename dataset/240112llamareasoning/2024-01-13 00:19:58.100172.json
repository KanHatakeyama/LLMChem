    "Reason": "Our target compound, trichlorofluoromethane has a basic structure of methane which has a melting point of -182.5\u00b0C. The introduction of halogen atoms typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals forces. Each chlorine atom adds significantly to the molecular weight and also increases polarity. We can estimate the influence of each Cl to be about +20\u00b0C to the melting point, and the one F atom to be about +5\u00b0C, given that it is less massive and less polarizing than Cl but still adds to the molecular weight and polarity. Therefore, the addition of three chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom are predicted to increase the melting point significantly from the base value for methane.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Base structure, methane, has a melting point of -182.5 degrees Celsius. \n- Each chlorine atom is expected to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and polarizability, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius per chlorine atom. \n- The trifluoromethyl group is highly electronegative and introduces strong dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +40 degrees Celsius. \n- The overall molecular symmetry and compactness of the molecule should also increase the melting point, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. \n\nCombining these effects, we predict the melting point of trichlorofluoromethane.\n##Prediction: -107.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
