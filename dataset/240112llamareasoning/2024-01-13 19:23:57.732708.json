    "Reason": "The basic unit, pyrazine, has a melting point around 55\u00b0C. Chloro groups usually increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and capacity for stronger intermolecular forces; however, the estimation is slightly high. A more conservative estimation would be +15\u00b0C per chloro group present in the molecule. There are four chloro groups, which would then suggest an increase of +60\u00b0C. The phenyl group (aromatic benzene ring) typically contributes to a higher melting point due to enhanced planarity and potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions; for this, let's estimate an increase of +25\u00b0C. Lastly, the primary amino group can form hydrogen bonds, but its impact on the melting point may not be as large as +15\u00b0C because it also introduces a site for potential intermolecular interactions that do not necessarily raise the melting point. An estimated increase for the amino group can be around +10\u00b0C. Thus, the cumulative adjustment from these functional groups is +95\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Each chlorine substituent on the benzene ring is expected to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and polarizability, estimated at +20\u00b0C per chlorine atom. \n- The aniline-like structure (two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring) contributes to the melting point through hydrogen bonding and resonance stability, estimated at +50\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two chlorine atoms and the aniline-like structure suggests a significant increase in melting point due to the cumulative effect of these functional groups. \n- The prediction is based on the cumulative effect of these functional groups on the basic benzene unit. \n##Prediction: 145.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
