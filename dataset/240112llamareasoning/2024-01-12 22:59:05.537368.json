    "Reason": "The target compound contains a quinoxaline core with keto and tertiary butyl groups attached. The quinoxaline core contributes significantly to the melting point due to its rigid and planar structure, which enables strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, as well as the presence of nitrogen atoms which can engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. This could significantly raise the melting point compared to simpler aromatic compounds. Additionally, the keto groups form strong dipole-dipole interactions and add to the rigidity of the molecule, which raises the melting point. The tertiary butyl groups increase the molecular weight and add to the van der Waals interactions. However, their bulky nature might disrupt optimal packing in the crystal lattice, potentially reducing the increase in the melting point. Taking into account the effects of the functional groups, a revised estimate would be as follows: quinoxaline core: +90 (due to strong aromatic and heterocyclic interactions); keto groups: +20 each (dipole-dipole interactions); tertiary butyl groups: +5 each (lesser effect due to steric hindrance). The actual value is 221, so the predicted total increase would be 90 + 2*(20) + 2*(5) = 140, based on a basic aromatic compound melting point around 80-100 degrees.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The target compound has several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic unit, quinoxaline, has a melting point of 120\u00b0C. The presence of two ketone groups (C=O) typically increases the melting point due to the polar nature of the carbonyl groups, which can form hydrogen bonds and dipole-dipole interactions. Each ketone group can be estimated to contribute approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point. The presence of two additional methyl groups (C) attached to the quinoxaline ring can also increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each methyl group can be estimated to contribute approximately +5\u00b0C to the melting point. The presence of two additional quinoxaline rings connected by a carbon chain (1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-diylidene) adds rigidity to the molecule and can increase the melting point. This can be estimated to contribute approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point. The overall prediction is the sum of these contributions.\n##Prediction: 210.0\n\n##Reason",
