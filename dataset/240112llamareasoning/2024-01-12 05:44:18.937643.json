    "Reason": "The target compound is benzoic acid with an additional 4-methoxybenzoyl group. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. For the benzoic acid (benzene with a carboxyl group), the melting point significantly increases due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and dipole-dipole interactions; this is typically an increase of about +122\u00b0C. The 4-methoxybenzoyl group also raises the melting point through increased molecular weight and stronger dispersion forces, as well as possible intermolecular hydrogen bonding, albeit less significant than the carboxyl group; this could roughly add an additional +20\u00b0C. These modifications lead to a cumulative effect, raising the melting point above that of benzene.",
