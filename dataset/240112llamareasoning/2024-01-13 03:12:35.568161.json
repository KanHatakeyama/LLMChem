    "Reason": "The compound 2-(2-pyridyl)-3H-indol-3-one N-oxide has various structural features affecting its melting point. The basic unit we will consider is benzene, known to have a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The structural features we will account for are: \n\n- Indole ring: +60 (the presence of a fused ring system like the indole usually raises the boiling point due to increased molecular complexity and size)\n- Pyridine ring: +50 (adding a heterocyclic aromatic ring such as pyridine with a nitrogen atom contributes to the rigidity and the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds)\n- Carbonyl group (C=O): +40 (the carbonyl group can form additional intermolecular forces through dipole interactions)\n- N-oxide group: +20 (provides additional polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point)\n\nAdding these modifications together, we estimate a shift in the melting point as follows.",
