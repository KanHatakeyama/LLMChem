    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison here is pyridine, which has a melting point of around -42\u00b0C. The nitrile group generally increases the melting point due to its strong dipole and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions. Furthermore, nitrile groups can engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which generally raises the melting point significantly. A nitrile substituent on the pyridine ring (as in isonicotinonitrile) can be expected to raise the melting point by approximately 118\u00b0C (considering such effects in similar structures).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for isonicotinonitrile is the isonicotinyl group, which is derived from the isonicotinic acid structure. The isonicotinyl group has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to its rigid structure and the ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The nitrile group (C#N) is an electron-withdrawing group that can increase the melting point due to its polarity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions. However, the nitrile group also introduces some flexibility to the molecule, which might slightly lower the melting point. The overall effect of the nitrile group is estimated to be a decrease of about -5\u00b0C. The isonicotinyl group's hydrogen bonding capability is already considered in the base value of isonicotinic acid.\n##Prediction: 95.0\n\n##Reason",
