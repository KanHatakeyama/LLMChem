    "Reason": "The compound in question is 2-(tert-butyl)-4-methylphenol. We start with the basic unit phenol, which has a melting point of approximately 41\u00b0C. We will then analyze the effects of each substituent on this base value. The tert-butyl group is large and bulky, which usually increases the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions. However, in this case, structural hindrance may cause a less orderly solid structure, potentially reducing the melting point. The methyl group is smaller but can still increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular size and van der Waals interactions, although to a lesser extent. The hydroxyl group (OH) is already accounted for in the base value of phenol. Based on these considerations, the tert-butyl group would contribute a larger increase, let's estimate +20\u00b0C, while the methyl group would contribute a smaller increase, estimated at +5\u00b0C. However, considering the structural hindrance from the tert-butyl, we will reduce its effect by half, so +10\u00b0C. Therefore, the overall predicted change in melting point is +10\u00b0C (tert-butyl) + +5\u00b0C (methyl) = +15\u00b0C.",

However, the effect of the hydroxyl group is already accounted for in the base value of phenol.\n##Prediction: 66.0\n##Reason",
