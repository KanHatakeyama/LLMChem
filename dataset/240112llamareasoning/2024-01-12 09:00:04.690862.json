    "Reason": "The target compound, (2Z)-But-2-enedioic acid, has several features affecting its melting point. The basic unit, ethene, has a melting point around -169\u00b0C. The introduction of two carboxylic acid groups would significantly increase this melting point due to their ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which means more energy is needed to break these interactions. Each carboxylic acid group can be estimated to contribute significantly to the melting point. The double bond in the alkenyl chain slightly increases rigidity, which could slightly elevate the melting point compared to a saturated analogue. Predicting the exact numeric contribution of each functional group is complex without empirical data, but considering these effects, a considerable increase from the basic unit is expected. The presence of two carboxylic acid groups is the primary consideration, potentially each contributing an estimated +130\u00b0C to the melting point based on similar compounds with carboxylic acid groups.",
