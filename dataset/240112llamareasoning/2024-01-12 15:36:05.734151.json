    "Reason": "The basic unit pyridine has a melting point of 17\u00b0C. The presence of an amino group (\u2013NH2) contributes to an increase in melting point through the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can raise the melting point substantially. Given that amino groups can have a strong effect due to hydrogen bonding, an estimated increase of about +60\u00b0C is reasonable. The bromo (\u2013Br) and chloro (\u2013Cl) substituents are bulky halogens that will increase the molecular weight and enhance the van der Waals forces. Bromine, being larger than chlorine, would have a somewhat stronger effect. An estimated increase can be +10\u00b0C for bromine and +5\u00b0C for chlorine. The prediction involves the additive effects of these substituents on the base melting point of pyridine.",
