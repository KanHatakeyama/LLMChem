    "Reason": "The compound borane trimethylamine can be considered as two components: borane (BH3) and trimethylamine (N(CH3)3). For the basic borane (BH3), there is no actual known melting point because it readily dimerizes to form diborane (B2H6), which also does not have a well-defined melting point due to its reactivity and the fact that it's a gas under standard conditions. However, we can estimate the contribution of the boron atom to be similar to an annealed carbon in a hydrocarbon (e.g., methane), as boron is in the same period and one group to the left of carbon in the periodic table. The melting point of methane is -182 degrees Celsius, so we could ascribe, for the sake of approximation, a similar starting point to a hypothetical BH3 unit. The trimethylamine portion of the molecule has a melting point of -117 degrees Celsius. The combination of boron with three methyl groups should raise this value because of the following reasons: increased steric hindrance, greater molecular weight, and enhanced molecular rigidity due to the boron-nitrogen coordination. Each methyl group could possibly raise the melting point by about 20 to 30 degrees Celsius from the base of trimethylamine. However, the strong B-N coordination will significantly boost the melting point as it adds considerable stability to the molecule. Hence, for this unique stabilization, we might expect an increase of around 60-80 degrees Celsius.",
