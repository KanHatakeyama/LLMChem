    "Reason": "The structure of the target compound contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its melting point: \n- Steroid backbone (constituted by four fused rings, which introduces rigidity): significantly increases the melting point when compared to simpler hydrocarbons. \n- Hydroxyl groups (-OH): capable of hydrogen bonding, which can significantly raise the melting point. Estimate +100 for the presence of two hydroxyl groups, each contributing approximately +50 due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. \n- Ketone group (C=O): also capable of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, adding to the melting point. Estimate +50 for one ketone group. \n- Hydroxymethylene group (-CH2OH): contributes to hydrogen bonding, similar to the hydroxyl groups. Estimate an additional +20 due to its polar nature. \n- Double bond (C=C): has a minor effect on melting point compared to other groups, however when in conjugation with a carbonyl it can have a stabilizing effect; for simplicity, its effect will not be accounted separately in this estimation. \n- Methyl groups: small increase due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; estimate an additional +10 for each of the two methyl groups. \n- Overall, the molecule's high degree of symmetry and packing capability in the crystal lattice due to the rigid steroid backbone also contributes significantly to a higher melting point, but this effect is complex to quantify and will be considered as part of the base steroid structure. \n\nBy considering the basic melting point of a steroid backbone, which is already high due to its complexity and rigidity, and adding the effect of the functional groups, we can estimate the melting point of our target compound. Assuming a basic steroid has a melting point of around 130, we add the effects of the functional groups: \n\nBase steroid: 130 \n+ 2 Hydroxyl groups: +100 \n+ Ketone group: +50 \n+ Hydroxymethylene group: +20 \n+ 2 Methyl groups: +20 \n------------------------------ \nTotal estimated melting point: ~320",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, androstane, has a melting point around 100\u00b0C.\n- Hydroxymethylene group: +20\u00b0C, due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase the rigidity of the molecule.\n- Hydroxy group: +30\u00b0C, as it can form strong hydrogen bonds, further increasing the melting point.\n- Keto group: +15\u00b0C, due to the polar nature and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions.\nCombining these adjustments results in a total predicted increase of 100 + 20 + 30 + 15 = 165\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 165.0\n\n\n#Problem",
