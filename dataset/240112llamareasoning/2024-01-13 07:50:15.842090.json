    "Reason": "The structure of 4-cyanobenzaldehyde includes a benzene ring as a base unit, an aldehyde functional group (-CHO), and a cyano group (-C#N). The basic melting point for benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. The aldehyde group, being polar, can form dipole-dipole interactions and potentially engage in hydrogen bonding, contributing significantly to the increase in melting point. This increase can be estimated at +70\u00b0C. The cyano group is highly polar and can also form strong dipole-dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. The impact of the cyano group can be estimated at +25\u00b0C. Thus, considering the rigid structure that both groups confer to the molecule, which generally elevates the melting point, as well as the strong polar nature of the functional groups which enhance intermolecular interactions, both modifications from the benzene ring are expected to increase the melting point considerably.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. \n- The presence of a cyano group (C#N) is a strong electron-withdrawing group that can significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding with other molecules. This effect might add approximately +80 degrees. \n- The aldehyde group (C=O) can also increase the melting point due to its polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding, adding around +20 degrees. \n- The combined effect of these groups on the rigidity of the molecule and the overall polarity of the compound should be considered, which might add another +10 degrees. \n- The presence of a single aromatic ring in the compound should be considered, which might add around +5 degrees due to the increased molecular rigidity and pi-pi stacking interactions. \n- The overall prediction should be adjusted to account for the cumulative effect of these functional groups.\n##Prediction: 120.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
