    "Reason": "The compound 1,2-ethanediol, dibenzoate contains several functional groups that influence its melting point. The base structure of the 1,2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol) has a melting point of -13\u00b0C. The introduction of benzoyl groups increases the rigidity of the molecule and significantly raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and possibly some pi-stacking interactions. Each benzene ring contributes positively to the melting point. Esters generally have moderate influence on melting points due to their polarity. Considering these effects, the benzoyl groups could add approximately +30 to +40\u00b0C each to the melting point, and the ethylene glycol part provides a low starting point. Adding the influence of the two benzoyl groups results in a substantial increase in melting point of the compound.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, ethanediol, has a melting point of -13 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a benzoate ester group significantly increases the melting point due to the presence of aromatic rings and the ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The ester group can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +100 degrees Celsius. The presence of two benzoate groups would further increase the melting point due to the additional aromatic rings and the potential for additional hydrogen bonding. The overall increase due to the ester groups is estimated to be +100 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 87.0\n\n##Prediction",
