    "Reason": "The basic unit to consider is pyrazole which has a melting point around 70\u00b0C. The addition of methyl groups tends to increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals forces. Each methyl group in a heteroaromatic compound might contribute approximately +10 to +20\u00b0C to the melting point because they provide more surface area for molecular interactions, and sterically hinder rotation around the molecule making it more rigid. Therefore, having two methyl groups should increase the melting point as compared to the base structure.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is pyrazole, which has a melting point of around 80\u00b0C. The addition of methyl groups to the pyrazole ring generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methyl group is expected to raise the melting point by approximately 5\u00b0C. However, the presence of the nitrogen in the ring also contributes to the melting point through hydrogen bonding, which can be estimated to add around 20\u00b0C. Therefore, the combined effect of two methyl groups and the nitrogen in the ring should be considered.\n##Prediction: 110.0\n##Reason",
