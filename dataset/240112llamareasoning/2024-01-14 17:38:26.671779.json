    "Reason": "The target compound is butyl tetranitrate glucopyranoside. The basic unit, glucopyranoside, can be related to glucose which has a melting point around 146 \u00b0C. The butyl group, being an aliphatic chain, would generally raise the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, although it can potentially introduce some flexibility which may slightly lower it. This effect is estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. Each nitrate group contributes significantly to the melting point due to its ability to engage in extensive intermolecular interactions, such as dipole-dipole attractions and possible hydrogen bonding, in addition to the steric hindrance and the introduction of a highly electronegative group that enhances the molecular rigidity. The impact of each nitrate group on the melting point is estimated to be around +12 \u00b0C. With four nitrate groups, we expect a cumulative addition of +48 \u00b0C to the melting point. Adding these effects leads to the predicted value.",
