    "Reason": "The compound (1S,4S)-2-boc-2,5-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has several functional groups, such as the tertiary butyl group (t-Bu), the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group, and the diazabicycloalkane structure. The basic bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has a strained ring system, which tends to increase the melting point relative to a similar acyclic compound due to the ring strain and symmetry. However, nitrogen atoms incorporated in the rings generally reduce the melting point compared to carbocycles because of the lower intermolecular forces relative to carbon-only rings. The Boc group, being bulky, increases sterical hindrance and slightly lowers the melting point due to the less efficient packing. Nonetheless, the t-Bu group, a large non-polar group, contributes to an increase in the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions compared to smaller alkyl groups. Considering these factors, the prediction is made as follows: Basic bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure: +30 (higher than acyclic due to strain), incorporation of N atoms: -10 (lower than carbocycles), Boc group: -5 (steric hindrance), t-Bu group: +10 (larger alkyl group).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, cyclohexane has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the boc group (tertiary butyl ester) generally increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two nitrogen atoms in the azabicyclic structure contributes to the melting point through increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +30\u00b0C for each nitrogen. \n- The bicyclic structure itself contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point, estimated at +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the double bond in the ring system may slightly increase the melting point due to the rigidity it introduces, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall effect of these functional groups on the melting point is additive.\n##Prediction: 65.0\n##Reason",
