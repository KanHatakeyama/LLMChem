    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of n-amyl acetate, consider the effects of the functional groups involved. The basic unit we can use as a reference is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -83.6 \u00b0C. Adding additional carbon atoms increases the molecular weight and surface area, which typically raises the melting point. Each additional methylene (CH2) group in a linear alkane chain increases the melting point by approximately 2 \u00b0C. n-Amyl acetate has three more CH2 groups than ethyl acetate (C2H5COOCH3). Also, the ester functional group (COO) generally has a lower melting point than a similar alkane because of the polar nature of the ester group enabling better packing compared to nonpolar alkanes. However, the elongation of the carbon chain could counterbalance the ester effect due to the increase in van der Waals forces. Since our base reference is already an ester, the main consideration will be the alkyl chain length.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pentane, has a melting point of -130 degrees Celsius.\n- The acetate ester group (COOCH3) is expected to increase the melting point due to the polar nature of the ester and the ability to form dipole-dipole interactions, which can be estimated to increase the melting point by about +40 degrees Celsius.\n- The n-amyl group (a five-carbon alkyl chain) is a larger hydrophobic group that can increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces, estimated to increase the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: -70.0\n\n\n#Problem",
