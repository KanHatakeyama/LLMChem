    "Reason": "The basic unit here can be considered as butadiene, which has a melting point of -108.9\u00b0C. Chlorination generally increases melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for greater intermolecular interactions. Each chloro group is expected to increase the melting point substantially. As there are 4 chloro groups, let's estimate the impact of each chloro group separately. Based on chlorobenzene, which increases the melting point by about 70\u00b0C when compared to benzene, we can estimate a smaller, but still significant, increase for each chlorine on a smaller aliphatic compound. Due to the cumulative effect, the increase is not expected to be linear, thus we will reduce the incremental increase for each subsequent chlorine. The first Cl might add approximately +40\u00b0C, the second +30\u00b0C, the third +20\u00b0C, and the fourth +10\u00b0C to the melting point of butadiene, totaling an increase of +100\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, butadiene, has a melting point of -138.4 Celsius.\n- Each chlorine atom is expected to increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the introduction of dipole-dipole interactions, which can be estimated at around +20 Celsius per chlorine atom.\n- The presence of two double bonds in the butadiene structure will increase the melting point due to the rigidity of the molecule and the potential for additional dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +10 Celsius for each double bond.\n##Prediction: 10.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
