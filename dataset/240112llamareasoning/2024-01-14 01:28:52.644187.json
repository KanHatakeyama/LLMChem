    "Reason": "For predicting the melting point of 6-nitroindole, we start with the basic structure of indole which generally has a melting point around 50\u00b0C to 60\u00b0C depending on its substitution. Indole itself is a fused ring system combining a benzene ring with a pyrrole ring which contributes to a higher degree of resonance and moderately high melting point. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) significantly increases the melting point due to the introduction of polar character and the ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the NH group on the indole, as well as dipole-dipole interactions. Additionally, nitro groups usually add about 80 to 100\u00b0C to the melting point of aromatic compounds due to these interactions and their electron-withdrawing nature.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, indole has a melting point of around 52\u00b0C. \n- Nitro group: +80\u00b0C (due to strong electron-withdrawing nature and the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point). \n- The presence of the nitro group also contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, which can further increase the melting point. \n- The indole itself is a rigid, planar structure, which also contributes to a higher melting point. \n- The nitro group's electron-withdrawing nature can also lead to stronger intermolecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. \n- The overall effect of the nitro group is to significantly increase the melting point of the indole.\n##Prediction: 132.0\n##Reason",
