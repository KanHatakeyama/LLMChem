    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be pyrazine, which has a melting point around 55 \u00b0C. Each chlorine substituent on the quinoxaline typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight, polarity, and possible intermolecular interactions, such as dipole-dipole attractions and hydrogen bonding with trace water. The presence of two chlorines could be expected to raise the melting point significantly. A single chlorine on an aromatic ring might raise the melting point by approximately 40-50 \u00b0C. So, for two chlorines the increment might be twice of this, leading to an increase of about 80-100 \u00b0C over the base pyrazine melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, quinoline has a melting point of 23 degrees Celsius. \n- Chloro substituents: Each chloro group is electron-withdrawing and can increase the melting point due to increased intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. The effect of each chloro group can be estimated as +20 degrees Celsius. \n- The quinoxaline structure itself is rigid and planar, which can increase the melting point due to better packing in the solid state. This effect can be estimated as +50 degrees Celsius. \n- The overall increase in molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure will further increase the melting point. \n##Prediction: 143.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
