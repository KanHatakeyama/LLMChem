    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethane, has a melting point of -172\u00b0C. \n- Acetyl chloride introduces a carbonyl group which can form dipole-dipole interactions and has a higher molecular weight than ethane, increasing the melting point. The carbonyl group can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 40\u00b0C. \n- The chlorine atom adds to the molecular weight and provides dipole-dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. Chlorine's electronegativity and mass could contribute an additional 20\u00b0C. \n\nTotal predicted increase: 40 + 20 = 60\u00b0C\n\n##Prediction: -112.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
