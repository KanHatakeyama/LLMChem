    "Reason": "Disperse red 1 consists of a conjugated system with two phenyl rings connected by an azo (-N=N-) bond. The biphenyl core structure has a melting point higher than benzene (estimated around 70\u00b0C) due to the larger size and planarity. The azo linkage contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule but does not greatly alter the melting point from the biphenyl base; therefore, we can neglect its contribution in this context (approximately +0\u00b0C). Nitro groups (-NO2) typically raise the melting point significantly due to their strong electron-withdrawing ability and the potential for intermolecular interactions, which we estimate at roughly +40\u00b0C for each. Therefore, the two nitro groups give an additive effect of +80\u00b0C. The presence of the amino group (-NH2) will increase the melting point through potential hydrogen bonding, which can be considered to add approximately +20\u00b0C. However, since it's part of the larger aminomethyl side chain attached to the phenyl ring, its impact could be slightly less pronounced. Lastly, the presence of an ethoxy (-OCH2CH3) side chain may slightly decrease the melting point due to its alkyl nature introducing some flexibility, which can be estimated at about -5\u00b0C. Adding these contributions together, we obtain a predicted melting point: Base biphenyl rings: 70\u00b0C, Azo linkage: +0\u00b0C, Nitro groups: +80\u00b0C (two groups), Aminoalkyl side chain: +20\u00b0C, Ethoxy group: -5\u00b0C. Therefore, the predicted melting point is 70 + 0 + 80 + 20 - 5 = 165\u00b0C.",
