    "Reason": "The target compound (2E)-2-(hydroxyimino)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propanoic acid has several functional groups that will influence its melting point. Using benzoic acid as the basic unit with a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius: the hydroxyimino group (\u2013NOH) adds significant hydrogen bonding capabilities leading to an increase in melting point (+30). The methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) attached to the phenyl ring generally has a mild influence on the melting point due to its electron-donating properties and moderate increase in molecular weight (+5). The additional ethylene (-C=C-) linkage to the carboxylic acid likely has a minimal effect as it does not significantly alter polarity or hydrogen bonding (+0).",
