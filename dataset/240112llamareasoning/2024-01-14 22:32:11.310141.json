    "Reason": "Our target compound, trichlorofluoromethane has a basic structure of methane which has a melting point of -182.5\u00b0C. The introduction of halogen atoms typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals forces. Each chlorine atom adds significantly to the molecular weight and also increases polarity. We can estimate the influence of each Cl to be about +20\u00b0C to the melting point, and the one F atom to be about +5\u00b0C, given that it is less massive and less polarizing than Cl but still adds to the molecular weight and polarity. Therefore, the addition of three chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom are predicted to increase the melting point significantly from the base value for methane.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, methane has a melting point of -182. The addition of chlorine atoms to the carbon chain generally increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and polarizability, which enhances intermolecular forces. Each chlorine atom can be estimated to add approximately +40 to the melting point.\n- Fluorine atom: +20 due to its high electronegativity and the ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions.\n- The presence of three chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom will significantly increase the melting point.\n##Prediction: -102.0\n##Reason",
