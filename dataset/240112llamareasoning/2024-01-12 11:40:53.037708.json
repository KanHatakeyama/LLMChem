    "Reason": "The basic unit for the compound could be considered as biphenyl, which has a melting point around 70\u00b0C. Phosphoramidate group introduces strong intermolecular interactions through hydrogen bonding due to its =O and N-H functional groups. Each carbonyl (=O) in the phosphoramidate group increases melting point due to hydrogen bonding, estimated at about 20-25\u00b0C per =O, resulting in a 40-50\u00b0C increase for both =O's. The N-H group's hydrogen bonding capability could raise the melting point by an additional 10\u00b0C. On the contrary, the ether linkage (P-O-C) has an ether-like character which typically lowers the melting point slightly, estimated at a decrease of 5-10\u00b0C. The net effect is a significant increase from the base biphenyl structure due to the dominant impact of hydrogen bonding from the =O and N-H groups.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Phosphoramidate group: This group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. The phosphoramidate group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 100\u00b0C. \n- Two phenyl groups: Each phenyl group increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each phenyl group can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the phosphoramidate group and the two phenyl groups will have a synergistic effect, which can further increase the melting point.\n##Prediction: 135.0\n##Reason",
