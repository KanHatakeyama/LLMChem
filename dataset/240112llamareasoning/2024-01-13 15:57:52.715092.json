    "Reason": "The basic unit here is aniline, which has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. Each methyl group typically increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Considering aniline's structure, two methyl groups in a meta position to the amino group would increase the substance's symmetry and packing efficiency, leading to a higher melting point. The inductive effect of the methyl groups could also provide some stabilization to the molecule, although the amino group's electron-donating effects might slightly lower the melting point. However, the symmetry due to the position of methyl groups will likely be the dominant factor. Based on an estimated +28-30 degrees Celsius increase per methyl group, we predict an increase of 56-60 degrees Celsius from the base of aniline.",
