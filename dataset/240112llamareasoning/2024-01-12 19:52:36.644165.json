    "Reason": "The compound cholestan-3-ol has a complex steroid structure which is derived from the basic structure of cholesterol. The core structure of steroids typically results in high melting points due to the rigid, planar four fused-ring system which allows for dense packing in the solid state. Each ring added to a hydrocarbon tends to increase the melting point due to increased molecular complexity and more intermolecular interactions. The presence of an alcohol group (hydroxyl, -OH) generally increases the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding, which provides additional intermolecular attractions that require more energy to overcome. However, since cholestan-3-ol is highly nonpolar with a single polar group, the effect of the hydroxyl group is somewhat limited compared to its influence in smaller or less hydrophobic molecules. Additionally, the multiple alkyl side chains contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, further increasing the melting point. However, due to the large size of the molecule, the incremental increase per functional group is less significant compared to simpler compounds. Without specific increments for the functional group effects in a complex molecule like this, we will provide a qualitative reasoning rather than a precise quantitative addition per functional group.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, cholestane, has a melting point of 100.0\u00b0C. The presence of the hydroxyl groups in cholestan-3-ol increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. Each hydroxyl group can be estimated to contribute approximately +100\u00b0C. The presence of the double bond in the molecule may slightly lower the melting point due to less efficient packing, but this effect is minor.\n##Prediction: 200.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
