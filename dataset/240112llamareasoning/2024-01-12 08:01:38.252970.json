    "Reason": "The melting point of clometacin is affected by its functional groups and overall molecular structure. Starting with an indole base, which typically has a melting point of about 52 degrees Celsius, we then consider the additional functional groups. The carboxylic acid group present in clometacin is a strong hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, which should increase the melting point significantly, approximately by +80 degrees Celsius. The chlorophenyl group adds more to the molecular weight and increases the intermolecular forces due to its polarity, contributing an estimated +30 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group is an electron-donating group which often has a stabilizing effect on the conjugated system, potentially raising the melting point somewhat, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The ketone functional group can participate in intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, expected to add another +20 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the nitrile group can engage in dipole interactions and could raise the melting point by about +50 degrees Celsius due to its strong dipole and potential for hydrogen bonding. Adding all these contributions gives us a prediction.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a chloro substituent on the benzene ring typically increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and polarizability, estimated at +40\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a carboxylic acid group contributes significantly to the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding, estimated at +100\u00b0C. \n- The presence of an amide group also contributes to the melting point through hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, estimated at +50\u00b0C. \n- The presence of an ether linkage (CC(O)=O) adds some rigidity to the molecule, estimated at +10\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular complexity and rigidity of the molecule will also increase the melting point, estimated at +50\u00b0C. \n\nCombining these effects, the predicted melting point is 255.5\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 255.5\n\n\n#Problem",
