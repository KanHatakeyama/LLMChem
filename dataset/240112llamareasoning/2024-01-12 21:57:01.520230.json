    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of N-boc-L-proline, we need to consider the impact of each functional group on the basic structure of proline, which has a melting point of around 220 degrees Celsius. The Boc group (tert-butoxycarbonyl) attached to the nitrogen introduces steric hindrance and a larger molecular weight, which typically lowers the melting point due to less efficient packing in the solid state; this can reduce the melting point by an estimated -60 to -100 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid group present in proline contributes to hydrogen bonding and thus would generally increase the melting point, but since it is also present in the base structure of proline the impact is already accounted for. Therefore, only the effect of the Boc group should be considered, which would lead to a decreased melting point from the base structure.",
