    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be naphthalene, which has a melting point of 80 degrees Celsius. For (1,1'-binaphthalene)-2,2'-diol, we have two naphthyl groups and two hydroxyl groups. The naphthyl groups significantly increase the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, leading to enhanced \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions and higher melting point. Each naphthyl might add approximately +60 degrees due to the increased molecular weight and planarity. Hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, which would significantly raise the melting point. Each hydroxyl group is estimated to add about +10 degrees due to hydrogen bonding and polarity effects. Summing these adjustments: 80 (naphthalene) + 2*60 (naphthyl groups) + 2*10 (hydroxyl groups) = 220 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, naphthalene, has a melting point of 80\u00b0C. \n- Each hydroxyl group (-OH) is capable of forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which significantly raises the melting point. Each hydroxyl group: +40\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two hydroxyl groups in the same molecule increases the melting point due to the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the molecules. Additional hydroxyl group: +20\u00b0C. \n- The molecule is rigid and planar, which can increase the melting point due to better packing in the solid state. Rigidity: +10\u00b0C. \n- The molecule has a large molecular weight, which can increase the melting point due to stronger van der Waals forces. Molecular weight: +5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two phenyl rings contributes to the melting point through increased pi-pi stacking and van der Waals interactions. Phenyl rings: +10\u00b0C each. \n##Prediction: 202.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
