    "Reason": "The basic structure of quinoline has a melting point of around 23\u00b0C. The presence of the hydroxy (-OH) group introduces hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point. Based on similar compounds, the hydroxy group is estimated to add around 50\u00b0C to the melting point of the core structure. Thus, the presence of the hydroxy group significantly increases the melting point of 8-hydroxyquinoline compared to quinoline.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, quinoline, has a melting point of around 23\u00b0C. \n- Hydroxy group (-OH): The hydroxy group can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. An estimated increase of about +50\u00b0C can be attributed to this group. \n- The quinoline structure itself is aromatic and planar, which can contribute to a higher melting point due to pi-pi stacking interactions. This effect is already accounted for in the base value of quinoline.\n##Prediction: 73.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
