    "Reason": "The base compound for consideration could be acetone, which has a melting point of -94.9 Celsius. Adding two carbonyl groups (as in 2,4-pentanedione) would increase intermolecular forces, particularly dipole-dipole interactions because of the polar C=O bond. Each additional carbonyl group could increase the melting point by about +36 degrees (similar to how it would affect boiling points). However, the effect on the melting point is usually less dramatic than on the boiling point due to the solid nature of the phase change. Additionally, the presence of the alpha-hydrogen atoms could facilitate hydrogen bonding among molecules, offering another increase. This hydrogen bonding influence could raise the melting point by an additional +5 degrees. There's also a minor effect due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions from longer alkyl chains compared to acetone. This might contribute a small incremental increase of about +1 degree per each additional -CH2- group when compared to acetone.",
