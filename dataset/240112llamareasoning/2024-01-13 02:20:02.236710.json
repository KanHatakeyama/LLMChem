    "Reason": "Nialamide is a compound that includes several functional groups such as the amide groups, amines, aromatic rings, and an alkyl chain that influence its melting point. The base structure here can be thought of as two benzenoid rings. Each benzene ring tends to have a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The amide groups typically increase the melting point of compounds due to the potential for hydrogen bonding; an amide group can add around 80 \u00b0C to a molecule's melting point. The presence of the secondary amine (\u2013NHN\u2013) can also raise the melting point slightly due to hydrogen bonding, let's estimate this at about 10 \u00b0C. However, the alkyl chain (-CCC-) in between amide groups introduces some flexibility to the molecule, which could decrease the melting point this is estimated to be around -5 \u00b0C. Considering there are two amide groups, two aromatic rings, and one amine, the overall adjustment would be: (2 * 5.5) + (2 * 80) + 10 - 5.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, aniline, has a melting point of 6 degrees Celsius. \n- The amide group (CONH2) is known to significantly increase the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, which can be estimated to add approximately +100 degrees Celsius. \n- The N-methyl group (N-CH3) adds steric bulk and slightly increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. \n- The N-ethyl group (N-C2H5) also adds steric bulk and van der Waals interactions, but to a lesser extent than the N-methyl group, estimated at +3 degrees Celsius. \n- The additional aromatic ring (phenyl group) contributes to the melting point through \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and increased molecular weight, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. \n- The overall molecular structure is complex and rigid, which can further increase the melting point due to better packing in the solid state, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. \n##Prediction: 148.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
