    "Reason": "The basic unit for piperazine is ethane, which has a melting point of -172\u00b0C. However, transforming ethane into a six-membered ring with two secondary amine groups dramatically affects the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds. Each nitrogen in piperazine can participate in hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. Since there are two such amine groups, we need to consider the additive effect of both. The introduction of a ring structure also contributes to a higher melting point due to ring strain and restricted rotation as compared to a linear counterpart. For the six-membered ring, we can estimate an increase by approximately +120\u00b0C. Each secondary amine can be estimated to increase the melting point by about +80\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding potential. Therefore, the adjustment for the ring is +120\u00b0C and for the amine groups is +160\u00b0C (2 amines x +80\u00b0C).",
