    "Reason": "The basic unit we can consider for flavone is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5 degrees Celsius. Flavone contains two aromatic rings, which tends to increase the melting point due to the additional \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions and rigidity of the molecule. Each phenyl group attached to the benzene contributes to an increase. The presence of the ketone (carbonyl group) introduces additional polarity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding with the adjacent hydroxyl group on the flavone structure, which can significantly raise the melting point. Given that each additional phenyl group can add approximately 20 degrees Celsius to the basic benzene unit due to increased molecular weight and planarity, and the additional oxygen functionality (carbonyl and hydroxyl) can add another 50 degrees Celsius due to the hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, the prediction can be made.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The flavone structure has two additional phenyl rings, which would increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each additional phenyl ring could be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C. \n- The hydroxyl group (OH) is capable of hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. The hydroxyl group could be estimated to add approximately +40\u00b0C. \n- The flavone structure also includes a ketone (C=O) group, which can participate in dipole-dipole interactions and could add approximately +10\u00b0C. \n- The flavone structure also includes a fused ring system, which can increase the rigidity of the molecule and thus the melting point. This could be estimated to add approximately +15\u00b0C. \n- The presence of aromatic rings and the potential for hydrogen bonding from the hydroxyl group would increase the melting point significantly.\n##Prediction: 110.0\n##Reason",
