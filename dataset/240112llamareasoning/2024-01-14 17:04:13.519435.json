    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of chlorine substituents generally increases the melting point due to their electronegative nature, the inductive effect, and increased intermolecular interactions like dipole-dipole attractions. Each chlorine is estimated to add about +40 \u00b0C due to these reasons. The bromide functional group is a larger halogen compared to chlorine and will likely lower the melting point due to its steric bulk, which hinders the packing of the molecules, estimated at -10 \u00b0C. With two chlorines, the increase is 2 * (+40 \u00b0C), and one bromide group leads to a decrease of -10 \u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Chloro substituents: Each chloro group is electron-withdrawing and increases the polarity of the molecule, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each chloro group is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C. \n- Bromo substituent: Bromine is larger and more electronegative than chlorine, which can further increase the melting point due to increased polarity and van der Waals forces. The bromo group is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 30\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two chloro groups and one bromo group will have a cumulative effect on the melting point.\n##Prediction: 75.0\n##Reason",
