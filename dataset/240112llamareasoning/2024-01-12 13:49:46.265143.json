    "Reason": "The basic unit in the case of benzyl sulfide is two phenyl rings connected by a sulfide (S) bridge. The closest reference compound for comparison is diphenyl ether (with an oxygen bridge), which has a melting point of around 28 C. The introduction of sulfur in place of oxygen generally increases the melting point due to larger atomic size and increased van der Waals forces, let's estimate this increases the melting point by +20 C. Each phenyl ring contributes to the rigidity and flatness of the molecule, which can further increase intermolecular interactions through pi-stacking. However, since the basic comparison already includes two phenyl rings as in diphenyl ether, the incremental increase due to this feature has been accounted for. The flexible two carbon chain between the sulfide and the phenyl ring can slightly decrease the rigidity and thus slightly decrease the melting point, by let's say -5 C, compared to rigid ring systems.",
