    "Reason": "The basic unit, ethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene group (CH2) in a saturated hydrocarbon chain generally raises the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius because of the increased van der Waals forces. The hydroxyl group (-OH) significantly raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +40 degrees Celsius. So we have the effect of one extra methylene group (+5) and a hydroxyl group (+40) on the base value of ethane.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethanol, has a melting point of -114.5. \n- The addition of a methyl group to ethanol typically increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. This could be estimated at +5. \n- The hydroxyl group in propan-1-ol is already accounted for in the base unit of ethanol. \nCombining these adjustments, we get: \n-114.5 (ethanol) + 5 (methyl group) = -109.5.\n##Prediction: -109.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
