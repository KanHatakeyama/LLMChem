    "Reason": "Starting with the base structure of naphthalene, which has a melting point of about 80\u00b0C, we need to account for the effects of the substituents. The hydroxyl group is a strong hydrogen bond donor which contributes to a significantly raised melting point. Hydrogen bonding is an intermolecular force that can substantially increase melting points; thus we can estimate an addition of about +30\u00b0C for the OH group. The chlorine atom increases the polarity and the molecular weight, which can also increase the melting point but to a lesser extent compared to the OH group; the Cl might add roughly +5\u00b0C to the melting point. The combined effect of these groups leads to an overall increase in the melting point.",
