    "Reason": "The target compound is cyclohexanecarbonitrile, 1-hydroxy-. The basic unit, cyclohexane, has a melting point of approximately 6.5 degrees Celsius. A hydroxyl group is typically associated with an increase in melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. The effect can be significant, although an increase of 50-100 degrees may overestimate its impact when there's only one such group in the molecule. A more conservative estimate would be an increase in the range of 20-40 degrees. The nitrile group contributes to the melting point through increased polarity and possible dipole-dipole interactions, although it does not form hydrogen bonds as effectively as hydroxyl groups. This group might increase the melting point by about 1-10 degrees since polarity is a less strong effect compared to hydrogen bonding. The combined effect of these functional groups must be balanced to predict the melting point accurately.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for cyclohexanecarbonitrile is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5 \u00b0C. The nitrile group (\u2013C#N) is a strong electron-withdrawing group that can form strong dipole-dipole interactions, which typically increases the melting point. The hydroxy group (\u2013OH) is also a polar group that can form hydrogen bonds, which can significantly increase the melting point. The presence of two such groups could contribute to a higher melting point. The prediction is based on the cumulative effect of these groups on the melting point of cyclohexane. Given that the nitrile group is likely to contribute more to the melting point than the hydroxy group due to its stronger electron-withdrawing nature, the prediction will be adjusted accordingly. The estimated increase for the nitrile group is around +20 \u00b0C, and the estimated increase for the hydroxy group is around +10 \u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 36.0\n\n##Prediction",
