    "Reason": "The compound 3-(3-nitrophenyl)-6-phenyl-5,6-dihydro[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazole contains several functional groups that affect its melting point. Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5. The molecule has two phenyl groups, which can increase the melting point by about +50 each due to pi-pi interactions and increased molecular weight. The 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazole system introduces nitrogen and sulfur atoms that add heteroatoms to the structure, increasing the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions; this heterocyclic system could contribute +80 to the melting point. The nitro group is an electron-withdrawing group that contributes to intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions; this could add another +30. Combining these effects, we expect the melting point to be in the range of 5.5 (benzene base) + 50 (phenyl group 1) + 50 (phenyl group 2) + 80 (triazolo thiadiazole system) + 30 (nitro group) = 215.5.",
