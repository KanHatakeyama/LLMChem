    "Reason": "The molecular structure of (2-amino-4-bromophenyl)(phenyl)methanol can be separated into three parts for estimation: the basic phenyl ring, a bromine substituent, and an amino and hydroxyl substituent. Let's start with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of substituents generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and increased van der Waals forces.\n\n- Bromine is a large halogen with significant mass which can raise the melting point significantly compared to a hydrogen atom. The impact of Br on the melting point could be estimated to increase it by about 20\u00b0C.\n\n- An amino group (-NH2) can participate in hydrogen bonding which can raise the melting point due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The presence of an amino group could increase the melting point by about 40\u00b0C.\n\n- A hydroxyl group (-OH) also is capable of hydrogen bonding, and similar to the amino group, it can raise the melting point. An increase of about 30\u00b0C can be attributed to this group.\n\n- The additional phenyl ring adds to the molecular weight and symmetry of the structure, which can further increase the melting point. This could add an estimated 10\u00b0C increase.\n\nAdding these together gives the total estimated increase in melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. \n- The presence of two phenyl rings increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi interactions, estimated at +40\u00b0C for each ring. \n- The bromine atom is a heavy halogen that increases the melting point due to its high atomic weight and the polarizability of the bromine-carbon bond, estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The amino group can form hydrogen bonds, which typically raises the melting point significantly, estimated at +30\u00b0C. \n- The hydroxyl group can also form hydrogen bonds, which can further increase the melting point, estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The cumulative effect of these groups should be considered in the prediction. \n##Prediction: 125.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
