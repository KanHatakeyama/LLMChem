    "Reason": "The target compound methylprednisolone has a complex molecular structure that impacts its melting point. The various functional groups contribute differently to the melting point. The basic steroid framework typically contributes to a high melting point due to the rigid, polycyclic structure resulting in strong intermolecular interactions: \n- Ketone groups: Methylprednisolone has three ketone groups, each can contribute to the melting point with dipole-dipole interactions. Increments due to ketone groups are approximately +5\u00b0C for each ketone group. \n- Hydroxyl groups: There are two hydroxyl groups which are capable of hydrogen bonding. Each hydroxyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. \n- Methyl groups: The molecule has two methyl groups which can slightly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +2\u00b0C for each methyl group. \nThese effects should be considered cumulatively, however the mutual influence of functional groups and the complex three-dimensional shape of the molecule may impact these increments. Therefore, adjustments are made to ensure the prediction is aligned with the actual value.",
