    "Reason": "The target compound 17-hydroxy-21-phenylpregn-20-yn-3-yl formate contains multiple functional groups that we need to consider for predicting its melting point. The core structure is a steroidal framework which typically has a high melting point due to its rigid and complex structure. For instance, simple steroids like testosterone have melting points around 155. Additionally, the compound contains a hydroxy group (-OH), a phenyl group (phenyl), an alkyne group (C#C), and a formate ester (-COO-). Different functional group contributions might be as follows: - OH group: +10 (hydrogen bonding increases intermolecular forces), - Phenyl group: +15 (due to pi-pi interactions and increased molecular weight), - Alkyne group: +5 (slight increase in linearity and molecular weight), - Formate ester: +5 (polarity contributes marginally to intermolecular forces and increased molecular weight).",
