    "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is affected by its molecular structure, functional groups, and the types of intermolecular forces. For phenyl carbamate, the starting point is phenol with a melting point of 41 degrees Celsius. The contribution of the functional groups to the melting point is as follows: Carbamate group (OC(=O)N): This functional group includes a -NH2 which can engage in hydrogen bonding, enhancing the boiling point significantly. The carbonyl (C=O) also contributes to the overall polarity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions. The addition of the carbamate group not only introduces hydrogen bond capabilities but also adds steric bulk and increases the molecular weight, which typically correlates with an increased melting point. The presence of the carbamate group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 110 degrees Celsius. The prediction integrates phenol's melting point with the estimated increase from the carbamate group.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The carbamate group (\u2013NHOH) is capable of hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. This effect can be estimated at +100\u00b0C. The phenyl group contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, which also increases the melting point. This effect can be estimated at +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group (\u2013C=O) can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, which might slightly increase the melting point. This effect can be estimated at +5\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 133.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
