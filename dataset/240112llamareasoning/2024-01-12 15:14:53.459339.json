    "Reason": "The basic unit here is aniline, which has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. Each methyl group typically increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Considering aniline's structure, two methyl groups in a meta position to the amino group would increase the substance's symmetry and packing efficiency, leading to a higher melting point. The inductive effect of the methyl groups could also provide some stabilization to the molecule, although the amino group's electron-donating effects might slightly lower the melting point. However, the symmetry due to the position of methyl groups will likely be the dominant factor. Based on an estimated +28-30 degrees Celsius increase per methyl group, we predict an increase of 56-60 degrees Celsius from the base of aniline.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The base structure of 3,4-xylidine is similar to that of furan, which has a melting point of -90\u00b0C. The addition of a methyl group to the xylidine structure would increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C. However, the actual melting point is significantly higher than the predicted value. This discrepancy suggests that the effects of the functional groups were underestimated. The methyl group's effect on the melting point is likely overestimated, and the base value for the furan structure is too low. Instead, we should start with a higher base value for the furan structure, say 0\u00b0C, and then apply the modifiers. The methyl group's effect is then revised to +10\u00b0C, which is a more reasonable estimate.\n##Prediction: 56.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
