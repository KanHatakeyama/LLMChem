    "Reason": "Benzene, the base unit for the compound, has a melting point at around 5.5 \u00b0C. The addition of a hydroxyl group (-OH) to form phenol increases the melting point due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, with phenol having a melting point of approximately 41 \u00b0C, which represents an increase of +35.5 \u00b0C. An aldehyde group (-CHO) does not significantly influence the melting point due to its small contribution to molecular size and dipole moment, so it can be estimated to add around +5 \u00b0C. The addition of two bromine atoms, being large and heavy, would significantly increase the melting point, approximately +20 \u00b0C per bromine atom. Since there are two, this results in a total increase of +40 \u00b0C\uff08+20 \u00b0C x 2\uff09. The intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups restricts free rotation and stabilizes the molecule, which generally could increase the melting point, estimated at an additional +5\u00b0C. The presence of a ring structure contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, which can also increase melting point, estimated at another +5 \u00b0C.",
