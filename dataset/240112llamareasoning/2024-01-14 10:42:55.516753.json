    "Reason": "Leflunomide is composed of several functional groups that affect its melting point: an aromatic ring, an amide group, a trifluoromethyl group, an isoxazole ring, and a methyl group. Starting with the melting point of benzene, which is 5.5 \u00b0C, we can estimate the effects of these groups. The amide group can facilitate hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point significantly; an estimated increment for this group could be around 100 \u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group, being strongly electronegative, will likely increase melting point due to stronger intermolecular interactions; this could increase the melting point by approximately 50 \u00b0C. The isoxazole ring introduces polarity and potential dipole-dipole interactions, which might raise the melting point by about 30 \u00b0C. A methyl group, while increasing molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, generally has a modest effect on melting point, so it could contribute an increase of around 5 \u00b0C. Summing these contributions would lead us to predict a melting point much higher than the actual value, so we need to adjust our estimates. Considering intermolecular forces being in line with similar molecular structures and the presence of multiple fluorine atoms that are known to significantly alter physicochemical properties, each increment for functional groups needs to be moderated to fit the actual value.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyrimidine, has a melting point of 20-22 degrees Celsius. \n- The presence of the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which increases the melting point due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding (+50). \n- The presence of the amide group (CONH2) significantly increases the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization of the amide bond (+100). \n- The presence of the ether linkage (O) between the two pyrimidine rings does not significantly affect the melting point. \n- The overall molecular weight and size of the molecule will also increase the melting point, but this effect is already accounted for in the contributions of the functional groups. \n##Prediction: 172.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
