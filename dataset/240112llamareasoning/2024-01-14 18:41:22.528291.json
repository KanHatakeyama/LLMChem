    "Reason": "The compound ethyl butyrate contains an ester functional group (-COO-) which can engage in dipole-dipole interactions. The base unit for comparison will be butane (a straight-chain alkane with similar carbon length), which has a melting point of -138.3\u00b0C. The ethyl ester moiety adds to the rigidity and enhances the dipole-dipole interactions of the molecule compared to butane. For the sake of this exercise, the ester group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 45 degrees (a qualitative estimate based on increased polarity and molecular interactions).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The base structure for ethyl butyrate is butane, which has a melting point of -138.4\u00b0C. The addition of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) to the butane increases the molecular weight and size, which typically raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. However, the presence of the ester functional group (-COO-) introduces polarity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can significantly increase the melting point. The ester group can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately 40\u00b0C due to these effects.\n##Prediction: -98.4\n\n##Reason",
