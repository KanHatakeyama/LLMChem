    "Reason": "The basic structure to consider is decane, which is a straight-chain alkane with 10 carbon atoms and has a melting point of -30\u00b0C. Adding an iodine atom will increase the molecular weight and the van der Waals forces, which typically raises the melting point to some extent. However, iodine being a larger halogen may offer more free volume and flexibility to the molecule which may lower the melting point slightly. Considering these factors together, the iodine substitution is expected to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions more than the decrease due to increased free volume. Iodine may raise the melting point by approximately +14\u00b0C.",
