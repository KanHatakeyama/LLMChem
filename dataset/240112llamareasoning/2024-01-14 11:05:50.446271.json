    "Reason": "The basic unit naphthalene has a melting point of 80\u00b0C. Adding a carboxamide group typically raises the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding potential (+70), but in this case, it's also influenced by the dihydroxy substitution, which further raises the melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding (+60). The n-butyl group adds some hydrophobic character and can lower the melting point due to increased molecular size and therefore decreased crystal packing efficiency (-10). The combined effect results in an overall increase.",
