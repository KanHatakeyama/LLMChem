    "Reason": "The basic unit for ammonia is nitrogen (N), which in its elemental form (N2) has a melting point of -210. The presence of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia (NH3) introduces polarity and hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point. However, due to its small molecular size, the increase is not as substantial as it might be in larger molecules with more extensive hydrogen bonding capabilities. Judging by the effect hydrogen bonding has on other comparable molecules, we can estimate an increase of about +130 above the melting point of diatomic nitrogen.",
