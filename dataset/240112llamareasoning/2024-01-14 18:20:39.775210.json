    "Reason": "The compound tolyfluanide includes a benzene ring, which contributes a base melting point of 5\u00b0C. The influence of the methyl group adds about 5\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and hydrophobic interactions. The presence of nitrogen in tertiary amine and sulfonamide groups significantly increases melt point due to potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, and this effect is estimated to be around 25\u00b0C. The sulfone group contributes a substantial increase of about 40\u00b0C because of the strong dipole-dipole interactions it creates. The chloro and fluoro substituents on the alkyl chain increase the melting point by about 15\u00b0C due to the inductive effect of halogens and increased molecular weight that leads to stronger van der Waals forces. Adding these increments to the base value provides the predicted melting point, taking into account slight overlaps in effects such as polarity and intermolecular forces.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the sulfonyl group (S(=O)2) typically increases the melting point due to the strong dipole and the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated to add around +40\u00b0C. \n- The amide group (CONH) is capable of forming hydrogen bonds and has a strong dipole, which can further increase the melting point, estimated at +30\u00b0C. \n- The chloro substituent on the benzene ring (Cl) is electron-withdrawing and can increase the melting point due to the increased polarity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The trifluoromethyl group (CF3) is highly electronegative and can increase the melting point due to the strong dipole and the ability to form dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the methyl group (CH3) is small and has a minimal effect on the melting point, estimated at +1\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the cyclohexyl group (C1CCCCCC1) increases the molecular weight and the van der Waals forces, which can slightly increase the melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecule is large and has multiple functional groups that can increase the melting point, but the presence of the bulky cyclohexyl group may slightly reduce the melting point due to steric hindrance, estimated at -5\u00b0C. \n- The cumulative effect of these groups is considered to be additive.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n##Reason",
