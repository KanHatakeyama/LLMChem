    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a hydroxyl group (-OH) generally increases the melting point due to its potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing to an estimated increase of +80\u00b0C. Each methyl group adds steric bulk and slightly raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces; let's estimate the effect of each methyl group as +5\u00b0C because methyl groups are small and their effect on melting point is lesser than large groups. The bromine atom, being a large halogen, adds significantly to the molecular weight, estimated to raise the melting point by +25\u00b0C due to increased van der Waals interactions. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding from -OH to Br has a notable impact on melting point; however, since this effect is somewhat included in the +80\u00b0C estimated for the hydroxyl group's hydrogen bonding capability, we should be cautious not to overestimate it. Thus, we will account for a modest additional increase of +5\u00b0C specifically for potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Summing these effects should provide a reasonable prediction.",
