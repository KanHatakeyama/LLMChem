    "Reason": "The target compound mephenytoin has several functional groups that influence its melting point. Starting with a phenyl group, which serves as the basic unit, the melting point of benzene is around 5.53\u00b0C (not directly relevant as benzene is liquid at room temperature, but similar aromatic compounds have higher melting points due to pi-pi interactions). The addition of functional groups will alter this base value. The compound contains a barbiturate core (malonylurea) which is known for strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability, typically conferring high melting points, although it is not a standalone group within the molecule. We also have an isopropyl group attached to the barbiturate core, which will increase the molecular weight and van der Waals forces slightly but not contribute much to the melting point due to its aliphatic nature. The N-methyl group also contributes slightly to the molecular weight, but being a small group, its effect is minimal. The presence of a secondary amide linkage (CO-NH) will engage in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point significantly. Therefore, considering the effects of these groups, the prediction aligns closely with the actual melting point observed for mephenytoin.",
