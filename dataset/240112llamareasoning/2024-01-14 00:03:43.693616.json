    "Reason": "Chlorine (Cl2) as a diatomic molecule has a simple molecular structure. The melting point of chlorine is primarily influenced by its Van der Waals forces, which are relatively weak compared to ionic or covalent bonds. As such, the melting point is low, as only these weak forces need to be overcome. The influence of each chlorine atom in the Cl-Cl bond to the melting point would be relatively minimal since both contribute equally and the molecule is symmetric.",
