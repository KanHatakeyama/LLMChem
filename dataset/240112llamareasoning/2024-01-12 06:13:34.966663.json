    "Reason": "The structure of caffeine is based on a fused ring system similar to pyridine, therefore, we start with pyridine's melting point as the basic reference value. Each functional group present in caffeine is then considered for its effect on the melting point: Three methyl groups are attached to nitrogen atoms. Typically, each methyl group increases the melting point by about +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The two carbonyl groups within the ring system are not typical amides but they still increase the rigidity of the molecule and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions, contributing to a higher melting point. However, since there is no NH for hydrogen bonding, the effect of each amide-like group is estimated to be lower than a typical amide but still significant at about +35\u00b0C per group. Additionally, nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic rings will increase the melting point due to their electronegative nature and the associated dipole-dipole interactions; these are estimated at +10\u00b0C for the imidazole nitrogen and +10\u00b0C for the pyrimidine nitrogen contributions. Therefore, the cumulative impact of all functional groups present in caffeine can be estimated and summed to the base value of pyridine to predict the melting point.",
