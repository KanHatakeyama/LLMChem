    "Reason": "The target compound, 3-(4-nitrophenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one, consists of a base structure of prop-2-en-1-one (acrolein) whose standard melting point is around -87 degrees Celsius. However, the substitution of phenyl groups and a nitro group significantly alters this melting point. The phenyl groups increase the planarity and stacking ability of the molecules, leading to enhanced pi-pi interactions which would substantially increase the melting point. The addition of a nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, increases intermolecular forces due to dipoles being formed, further raising the melting point. Estimating the effects quantitatively, the addition of each phenyl group may increase the melting point by about +100 to +150 degrees Celsius given the strong pi-pi interactions and the increase in molecular weight. The nitro group may add another +30 to +50 degrees Celsius due to the enhanced dipole moments it introduces. Summing these up provides a predicted value.",
