    "Reason": "The target compound 1-bromoundecane consists of a long carbon chain (undecane) and a bromo functional group. For the base structure, let's consider undecane, which has a melting point of -25.6 degrees Celsius. The bromo group typically increases the melting point due to its higher molecular weight and polarizability, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. The alkyl chain has 11 carbons, and each additional methylene (-CH2-) group in an alkyl chain roughly contributes -5 degrees Celsius to the melting point. However, since in this case the base molecule is undecane itself, we only need to consider the effect of the bromo group. Adding a bromo group can increase the melting point by around 20 degrees Celsius due to the reasons mentioned.",
