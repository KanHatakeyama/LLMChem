    "Reason": "The basic structure of quinoline has a melting point of around 23\u00b0C. The presence of the hydroxy (-OH) group introduces hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point. Based on similar compounds, the hydroxy group is estimated to add around 50\u00b0C to the melting point of the core structure. Thus, the presence of the hydroxy group significantly increases the melting point of 8-hydroxyquinoline compared to quinoline.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The base structure for 8-hydroxyquinoline is quinoline, which has a melting point of 23.5\u00b0C. The hydroxy group (OH) is a polar functional group that can form hydrogen bonds, which generally increases the melting point. The hydroxy group can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 40-50\u00b0C. Additionally, the quinoline structure itself has a rigid planar structure that can lead to strong pi-pi stacking interactions, which would further increase the melting point.\n##Prediction: 63.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
