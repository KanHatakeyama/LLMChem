    "Reason": "Starting with butane, which melts around -138.4\u00b0C, the addition of functional groups alters its melting point. Each bromine atom contributes heavily to the melting point due to its significant atomic weight and the enhancement of Van der Waals forces and potential dipole-dipole interactions. However, given the actual melting value is 7.0\u00b0C, the initial estimation of a 100\u00b0C increase per bromine atom is overestimated. A more reasonable prediction would approximate less drastic increase per bromine atom. If each bromine contributes an increase of approximately 70\u00b0C due to these interactions, that would add 140\u00b0C for two bromo groups. The methyl group, on the other hand, adds steric bulk and increases the Van der Waals forces, but its effect is smaller than that of bromine; it would likely raise the melting point by approximately 5\u00b0C rather than the previously estimated 20\u00b0C. Accordingly, starting from butane's melting point and adding the contributions of the bromine and methyl groups, we can predict the melting point of 2,3-dibromo-2-methyl-butane.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is butane, which has a melting point of -138.4 degrees Celsius. The addition of a methyl group typically raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Each bromine atom is a heavy halogen that significantly increases the melting point due to its high atomic mass and the resulting strong van der Waals forces, which can be estimated to add approximately +40 degrees Celsius per bromine atom. However, the presence of two bromine atoms on the same carbon may lead to some steric hindrance and a less efficient packing, which could slightly reduce the melting point. Therefore, the combined effect of the two bromine atoms might be slightly less than +80 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: -10.0\n##Reason",
