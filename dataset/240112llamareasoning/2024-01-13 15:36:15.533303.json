    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzoic acid, has a melting point of 122\u00b0C. The ethyl ester group tends to lower the melting point compared to the acid due to a decrease in hydrogen bonding capacity (-5). However, the presence of the indole moiety, similar to an additional fused benzene ring, will increase the melting point due to greater pi-pi interactions and rigid structure (+7).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Indole group: +80\u00b0C, due to the presence of a fused ring system and the nitrogen atom which can participate in hydrogen bonding. \n- Carboxylic acid ester group: +40\u00b0C, due to the ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and the polar nature of the ester group. \n- Ethyl group: +5\u00b0C, due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. \n- The overall molecular structure is planar and symmetrical, which can contribute to efficient packing in the solid state, estimated to add +5\u00b0C. \n\nCombining these effects, we predict the melting point of ethyl indole-2-carboxylate.\n##Prediction: 135.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
