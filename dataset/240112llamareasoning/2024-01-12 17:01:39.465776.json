    "Reason": "The target compound hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid with a structure that includes several functional groups affecting its melting point. The compound consists of a fused four-ring system typical of steroids with a combination of hydroxyl groups, ketones, and a short side chain with a carboxyl group. Here\u2019s the quantitative assessment of its melting point based on functional group effects: \n- Base steroid structure: typically a high melting point due to the rigid and planar structure, which promotes intermolecular interactions; approximate starting value: 170\u00b0C. \n- Hydroxyl groups (three in total): each hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds, thus raising the melting point; typical increase per hydroxyl group in a steroid: +5\u00b0C; total increase: +15\u00b0C. \n- Ketone groups (two in total): each ketone group also is capable of hydrogen bonding and restricts molecular rotation, leading to higher melting points; typical increase per ketone in a steroid: +5\u00b0C; total increase: +10\u00b0C. \n- Carboxyl group: contributes to additional hydrogen bonding and also increases polarity, which typically increases melting points; typical increase: +8\u00b0C. \n- Short side chain with an alcohol: a minimal effect as it may increase slight molecular weight but does not significantly change the overall structure; typical increase: +2\u00b0C. \nAdding up these changes gives the predicted value close to the actual melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, steroid structure: The basic unit for hydrocortisone is cholestane, which has a melting point of around 140\u00b0C.\n- Hydroxyl groups: Hydrocortisone has three hydroxyl groups, which are capable of forming hydrogen bonds and significantly increase the melting point. Each hydroxyl group can be estimated to add approximately +40\u00b0C to the melting point due to hydrogen bonding.\n- Ketone groups: There are two ketone groups in hydrocortisone, which can form additional dipole-dipole interactions and may slightly increase the melting point. Each ketone group can be estimated to add approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point.\n- Methyl groups: Hydrocortisone has three methyl groups, which can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methyl group can be estimated to add approximately +5\u00b0C to the melting point.\n- Steroid ring: The steroid ring structure provides a rigid framework that can increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and packing of the molecule. This can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point.\n- Total predicted increase: 3 hydroxyl groups * +40\u00b0C each + 2 ketone groups * +10\u00b0C each + 3 methyl groups * +5\u00b0C each + 20\u00b0C for the steroid ring structure.\n##Prediction: 235.0\n##Reason",
