    "Reason": "The compound o-methyl carbamate (NC(=O)OC) consists of an amide (carbamate) functional group and a methoxy group. In terms of the structure and the associated impacts on boiling point: Basic unit, amides generally have high boiling points due to strong hydrogen bonding, typically greater than 100. Methoxy group: The addition of a methoxy group can contribute to a moderate increase in boiling point due to the addition of molecular weight and slight increase in polarity, estimated at +10. However, the overall size of the molecule is relatively small, which limits the increase in boiling point. Considering these factors, the estimated contribution of the functional groups would lead to a predicted boiling point that is somewhat higher than that of simple amides due to the methoxy group but tempered by the small molecular size.",
