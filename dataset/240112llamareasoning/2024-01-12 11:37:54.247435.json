    "Reason": "The basic unit to compare with might be glucose, since miglustat resembles a modified glucose molecule; glucose has a melting point of about 146 degrees Celsius. The following changes are present in miglustat: (1) a hydroxyl group at position 2 is replaced by a nitrogen-containing six-membered ring. Replacing a hydroxy group with a more complex, heterocyclic ring system could potentially heighten the melting point due to additional van der Waals forces and possible hydrogen bonding, let's approximate this increase to be around +20 degrees Celsius. (2) The nitrogen substituent includes butyl chains (propyl + methyl) which should raise the melting point slightly due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; let's estimate the butyl effect to be +5 degrees Celsius for the propyl part and +2 for the methyl part. Summing the effects gives an increase of 27 degrees Celsius to the base melting point of glucose.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the amide group (C=O) typically raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can be estimated to add around +80\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the thioether (S) group can also increase the melting point due to the polar nature of the sulfur atom and the potential for additional dipole-dipole interactions, estimated to add around +20\u00b0C. \n- The hydroxyl group (OH) can form hydrogen bonds, which can significantly increase the melting point, estimated to add around +40\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the methyl group (CH3) attached to the nitrogen in the amide can slightly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated to add around +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups contribute to a higher melting point.\n##Prediction: 165.0\n##Reason",
