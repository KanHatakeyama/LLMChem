    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. An acetyl group (ethanone portion) attached to a benzene ring typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for additional dipole-dipole interactions, which can be estimated as a +40 increase. However, for 1-(4-Iodophenyl)ethanone, the iodine substituent significantly influences the melting point due to its large size and weight, which can lead to a stronger intermolecular van der Waals attraction. In iodobenzene, the iodine contributes a +73 increase in melting point relative to benzene. Combining these two substituents' effects should be generally additive, but there might be some attenuation due to steric hindrance or other structural effects. Considering the actual value of 85.1 degrees Celsius, it seems that the combined effect of both functional groups is less additive than expected. Adjusting the predicted values to better match the actual melting point would require reducing the estimated values for the acetyl and iodine contributions.",
