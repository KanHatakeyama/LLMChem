    "Reason": "The base structure for 2-methyl-4-nitrobutane is butane, with an estimated melting point of -138.3 degrees Celsius. The addition of a methyl group typically increases the melting point because of greater molecular weight and van der Waals forces; this usually results in a modest increase, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group, by contrast, has a much more substantial effect due to its greatly electronegative nature and its capacity for strong dipole-dipole interactions. The nitro group can be expected to raise the melting point significantly, estimated at +230 degrees Celsius, reflecting the strong intermolecular forces. Sorting these effects into an aggregated melting point prediction provides a value that should closely align with the actual melting point of the compound.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Base compound, butane has a melting point of -138.4 Celsius. \n- The methyl group typically raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces, estimated at +5 Celsius. \n- The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group that can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, significantly raising the melting point; this effect is estimated at +100 Celsius. \n- The nitroso group (NO) is a polar group that can also participate in hydrogen bonding, further increasing the melting point; this effect is estimated at +20 Celsius. \n- The alkyl chain (butane) provides a base structure for the molecule, but its effect on melting point is minimal. \n##Prediction: 85.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
