    "Reason": "To predict the melting point for isobutyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, we analyze the functional groups and their likely contributions based on structure and intermolecular forces: \n- Base unit, benzoic acid, has a melting point of 122\u00b0C, which is quite high due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and a rigid planar structure supporting effective stacking and crystallization. \n- Isobutyl group: -20 (lower melting point due to the increased steric bulk and branched structure, which can hinder crystal packing). \n- Hydroxyl group: This might intuitively suggest an increase because of additional hydrogen bonding, however, since the hydroxyl is part of the phenol group, it has already been considered in the base unit of benzoic acid. \n- Ester linkage (in place of the carboxylic acid hydrogen): -25 (the C=O and O could be expected to form some dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding, but the ester's alkyl chain decreases the potential for effective hydrogen bonding compared to the carboxylic acid, leading to a decrease in the melting point compared to benzoic acid). \nCombining these effects gives a predicted melting point lower than that of benzoic acid but still within a moderate range due to the aromatic ring and potential for some hydrogen bonding.",
