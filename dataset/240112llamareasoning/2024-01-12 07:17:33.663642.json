    "Reason": "Basic unit, pyrazole, typically has a melting point in the range of 70 to 100 degrees Celsius. The amino group (-NH2) generally increases the melting point due to the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, potentially adding +20 to +50 degrees. The nitrile group (-C\u2261N) is electron-withdrawing and can also participate in dipole-dipole interactions, potentially adding +10 to +30 degrees. Each group's effects might not be simply additive due to potential intramolecular interactions, but for this estimation we'll consider an additive model.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound 3-amino-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile contains several functional groups that influence its melting point: a pyrazole ring, an amino group, and a nitrile group. The base structure can be considered as pyridine, which has a melting point of 11\u00b0C. The pyrazole ring introduces additional nitrogen atoms and aromaticity, which can raise the melting point by approximately 40\u00b0C due to increased molecular rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The amino group can form hydrogen bonds, which can significantly increase the melting point by approximately 50\u00b0C. The nitrile group is polar and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, adding approximately 20\u00b0C. Combining these effects on top of the base structure melting point yields the predicted value.\n##Prediction: 181.0\n\n##Prediction",
