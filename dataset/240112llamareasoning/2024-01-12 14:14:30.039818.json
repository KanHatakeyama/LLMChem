    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of nitro groups to the benzene ring increases the melting point because of the electron-withdrawing nature of these groups, which strengthens intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Each nitro group is expected to add approximately +40 degrees Celsius. However, the meta positioning of the nitro groups could make the increase slightly lower due to reduced symmetry and possible steric hindrance, which might slightly disrupt effective intermolecular interactions. To account for this, we can adjust the addition to be around +38 degrees per nitro group.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for 1,3-dinitrobenzene is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Nitro groups are highly electron-withdrawing and can form strong intermolecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions, which significantly increase the melting point. Each nitro group is expected to raise the melting point by approximately 40 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the addition of two nitro groups to benzene is predicted to increase the melting point by 80\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 85.5\n\n\n#Prediction",
