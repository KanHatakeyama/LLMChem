    "Reason": "The base structure for the compound is cyclopentane, which has a melting point around -94 degrees Celsius. The introduction of hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) generally increases the melting point due to the hydrogen bonding potential. The compound has two hydroxyl groups. One hydroxyl group can raise the melting point considerably. Assuming each \u2013OH raises the melting point by about 60-70 degrees Celsius, due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, we can estimate the increment.",
