    "Reason": "The compound 2-n-butoxyethanol is comprised of an ethylene glycol unit and a butyl ether unit. The ethylene glycol unit has a melting point around -13\u00b0C. The added butyl group introduces van der Waals forces and makes the compound larger, which would typically make the melting point higher. However, the ether linkage decreases the possible hydrogen-bonding interactions compared to a straight-chain alcohol with a molecular weight similar to that of 2-n-butoxyethanol. We'll assign a +4\u00b0C increase for the butyl group's van der Waals interactions, and a -70\u00b0C decrease due to the weakened hydrogen-bonding capacity and increased conformational flexibility from the ether linkage.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethanol has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. \n- The addition of a butoxy group (butyl group attached to an ether oxygen) generally increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the introduction of a polar functional group that can engage in dipole-dipole interactions. The butyl group is a larger alkyl group compared to methyl, which would typically increase the melting point. However, the presence of the ether linkage (oxygen single bond to carbon) in the butoxy group may slightly reduce the melting point due to the flexibility it introduces. \n- The effect of the butoxy group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: -94.0\n##Reason",
