    "Reason": "The compound terbuthylazine consists of a triazine ring as the basic unit structure which includes nitrogen atoms and chlorine substituents. Considering the triazine as a basic heterocyclic ring and drawing a comparison to pyrimidine which has a melting point of around 123\u00b0C. The chlorine atom generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and enhanced polarizability, which usually contributes to stronger intermolecular forces like van der Waals forces. Let's estimate this increment to be +20\u00b0C. Each alkylamino substituent (NCC and NC(C)(C)C) also increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance, which also leads to stronger intermolecular forces. A tertiary-butyl group is quite bulky, and we might estimate an additional +20\u00b0C for the tertiary-butyl, and +15\u00b0C for the ethylamino group. Thus, approximating for the two substituents as +35\u00b0C in total.",
