    "Reason": "The basic unit, indole, has a melting point around 52. When substituting an amino group at the para position to the NH of the indole, its effect on the melting point must be considered. The amino group generally increases the melting point due to its potential for hydrogen bonding, which increases the stability of the solid phase. However, the predicted increase provided in the Reason is insufficient. Taking into account the substantial hydrogen-bonding ability of the amino group, the increase should be reconsidered. A more accurate estimate for an amino group's contribution to the melting point of an aromatic heterocycle like indole might be around +56. This adjustment would reflect the stronger intermolecular forces and increased molecular rigidity provided by the amino group at such a position.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The amino group (-NH2) is a polar group that can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. The amino group can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 80 degrees Celsius due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. The indole ring is a fused ring system which increases rigidity and planarity, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, and thus can increase the melting point. The indole ring can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 20 degrees Celsius due to these effects.\n##Prediction: 95.0\n\n##Prediction",
