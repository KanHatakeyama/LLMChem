    "Reason": "Lupeol consists of a pentacyclic triterpene structure, which forms a rigid and complex framework increasing the melting point due to strong Van der Waals forces and limited rotational freedom. Large fused ring systems significantly increase the melting point. Each ring can contribute approximately +20\u00b0C due to its rigidity and intermolecular forces. The molecule has five fused rings, so this could add about +100\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group contributes to the melting point through hydrogen bonding, which might add approximately +5\u00b0C. Methyl groups attached to the rings increase the molecular weight and Van der Waals interactions but have a smaller effect in such a large molecule, estimated at +2\u00b0C per methyl group. Lupeol has eight methyl groups, adding up to roughly +16\u00b0C. Saturation levels can affect the packing and melting point, but due to the already rigid structure of lupeol, the effect may be slight and is considered negligible in this estimation.",
