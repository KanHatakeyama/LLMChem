    "Reason": "Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) has a complex steroid structure with multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. The melting point is influenced by the following factors: \n- Alkene groups typically may lower the melting point slightly due to reduced symmetry but the rigidity and planarity in this molecule may mitigate this effect. \n- Methyl groups generally contribute an incremental increase to the melting point due to higher molecular weight; assumed to be +5 to +10 \u00b0C per group. \n- The hydroxyl group significantly increases the melting point through hydrogen bonding; estimated to be +50 to +100 \u00b0C. \n- The steroid backbone and ring fusion contribute to a higher melting point by reducing molecular flexibility. \nConsidering these effects, a quantitative adjustment based on the steroid base structure with additional alkene and methyl groups and one hydroxyl group is as follows:",
