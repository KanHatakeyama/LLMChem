    "Reason": "The basic unit for dl-proline can be considered as butanoic acid, which has a melting point of around -5\u00b0C. Each of the distinct functional groups will adjust the melting point of this basic structure. The secondary amine (part of the pyrrolidine ring in proline) introduces ring strain and hydrogen bonding capability, which significantly increases the melting point, I estimate by about +180\u00b0C. The conversion of a primary carboxylic acid to the secondary amide (part of the same pyrrolidine ring) further enhances hydrogen bonding and restricts rotation, increasing the melting point, estimated at an additional +30\u00b0C. The ring formation itself also limits molecular rotation and adds to the rigidity of the structure, which raises the melting point, and this might be estimated as an additional +10\u00b0C. Altogether, the cumulative estimated increase in melting point is +220\u00b0C when compared to butanoic acid.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, proline has a melting point of 205\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the d-configuration (as opposed to l-configuration) in dl-proline generally increases the melting point due to the increased rigidity of the molecule. This effect can be estimated to add around +10\u00b0C. \n- The hydroxyl group (OH) in the proline can form hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point. However, since the hydroxyl group is part of a cyclic structure, its effect on the melting point is less pronounced than in a linear molecule. This effect can be estimated to add around +5\u00b0C. \n- The amide group (C=O) in proline can also form hydrogen bonds, which would further increase the melting point. However, since the amide group is part of a cyclic structure, its effect on the melting point is less pronounced than in a linear molecule. This effect can be estimated to add around +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the secondary amine (NH) in the proline can also contribute to the melting point through hydrogen bonding. This effect can be estimated to add around +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall effect of the d-configuration and the cyclic structure is to increase the rigidity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which would increase the melting point.\n##Prediction: 220.0\n##Reason",
