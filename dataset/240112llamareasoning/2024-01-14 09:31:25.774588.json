    "Reason": "The basic units for fumaronitrile are an alkene and two nitrile groups. For alkenes, we can start with ethylene, which has a melting point of \u2212169.2\u00b0C. Each nitrile (cyano) group raises the melting point due to the strong dipole-dipole interactions and potential for cyano-cyano interactions across molecules. We can assign a +130\u00b0C contribution per nitrile group. There is also a contribution due to the conjugated system of the double bond with the nitrile groups, which adds rigidity and pi-pi interactions that could further raise the melting point, estimated at +10\u00b0C. Combining these factors: ethylene base (-169.2), nitrile contributions (2 * +130), and conjugation (+10).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two nitrile groups (C#N) increases the melting point due to the strong dipole-dipole interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which could add approximately +40\u00b0C for each nitrile group. \n- The presence of a double bond (C=C) in the molecule may slightly increase the melting point due to the rigidity it introduces to the molecule, which could add around +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular weight and the planar structure of the molecule will also contribute to an increase in the melting point, but this effect is not quantifiable. \n##Prediction: 105.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
