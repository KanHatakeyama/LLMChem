    "Reason": "The compound (2-aminoethoxy)acetic acid has several functional groups that affect its melting point. The base structure is two carbon aliphatic chain, which has a very low melting point. However, having an amino (-NH2) group generally increases the melting point due to possibilities for hydrogen bonding (+50). An ether group (C-O-C) might slightly lower the melting point due to the ether oxygen's branching effect (-5). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) greatly increases the melting point because of the strong hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions it can participate in with neighboring molecules (+120). Combining these effects, we predict the melting point adjustment.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is acetic acid, which has a melting point of 16.6. The amino group (NH2) typically increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated at +40. The ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) is a polar group that can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, which might add around +10. The acetic acid moiety itself contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated at +100. The overall prediction is the sum of these effects.\n##Prediction: 166.0\n\n##Prediction",
