    "Reason": "The basic unit to consider here is benzene, which has a melting point of around 5.5\u00b0C. The compound is N-Acetyl-l-phenylalanine, and we need to take into account various functional groups and structural changes:\n- Phenyl group: +70 (introduces rigidity and pi-stacking possibilities)\n- Amide linkage (N-C=O): +40 (strong hydrogen bonding)\n- Acetyl group (CH3CO-): +20 (more rigidity and possible hydrogen bonding)\n- Carboxylic acid (COOH): +50 (capable of strong hydrogen bonding)\n- Removal of a hydrogen due to the secondary amine: -5 (slightly less hydrogen bonding compared to primary amide)\nThese modifications lead to an increase in the melting point due to increased molecular weight, introduction of hydrogen bonding capabilities, and the overall rigidity of the compound.",
