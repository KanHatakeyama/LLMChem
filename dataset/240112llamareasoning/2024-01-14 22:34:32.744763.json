    "Reason": "The base unit for comparison here could be phenol, which has a melting point of 41\u00b0C. Guaiacol carbonate differs from phenol by having two methoxy groups and a carbonate bridge linking two phenolic rings. Each methoxy group generally increases the melting point by introducing stronger intermolecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions. Estimating a +15\u00b0C increase per methoxy group. The carbonate bridge adds rigidity and intermolecular interactions across the molecule. This could add another +20\u00b0C increase to the melting point. The combined predicted increase would therefore be (15+15+20) = 50\u00b0C above the melting point of phenol.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The base structure of guaiacol is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which has a high melting point due to its planar structure and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. The introduction of a carbonate group (CO3-) generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the increase in molecular weight. The methyl group (CH3-) attached to the guaiacol ring contributes to an increase in melting point due to van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The presence of the carbonate group is expected to increase the melting point by approximately +100\u00b0C due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the rigidity it adds to the molecule.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n\n##Prediction",
