    "Reason": "The basic unit for a monosaccharide like glucose could be considered as a simplified six-membered ring structure, which would have a melting point lower than 146 degrees C in the absence of any functional groups. Each hydroxyl (-OH) group substantially raises the melting point due to increased intermolecular forces from hydrogen bonding. There are five hydroxyl groups in alpha-D-glucose that can form hydrogen bonds, but their effect is not fully additive due to the ring structure and steric hindrance between adjacent groups. The effect of each hydrogen bond on the melting point can be estimated at +20 degrees C for the first hydroxyl group, with a decrease by 3 degrees C less for each subsequent group given the steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding that can occur. This leads to an increase of +20 for the first, +17 for the second, +14 for the third, +11 for the fourth, and +8 for the fifth. Additionally, the hemiacetal form intramolecular bonding contributes further to the overall melting point, adding an estimated +5 degrees C.",
