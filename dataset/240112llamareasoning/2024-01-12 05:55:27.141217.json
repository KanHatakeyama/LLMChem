    "Reason": "The structure of nicofuranose contains multiple functional groups that can influence its melting point. Starting with a benzene ring as the basic unit, which typically has a melting point around 5.5 \u00b0C:\n- Carboxylic ester groups (five in total): each can increase the melting point due to enhanced polar interactions and possible intra- or intermolecular hydrogen bonding. A conservative estimate would be an addition of about +20 \u00b0C for each ester group.\n- Furanyl rings (three in total): each furanyl ring likely contributes to increased rigidity and potential aromatic stacking interactions, which can raise the melting point. Estimating a +10 \u00b0C increase for each of these rings.\n- Pyridine rings (three in total): nitrogen in the ring contributes to stronger intermolecular interactions compared to benzene, which can raise the melting point. Estimating a +15 \u00b0C increase for each pyridine ring.\n\nThe adjustments are cumulative, so with the above considerations, we can predict an additive effect on the melting point.",
