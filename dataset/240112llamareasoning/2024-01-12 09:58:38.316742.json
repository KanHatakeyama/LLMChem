    "Reason": "The basic structure of imidazole has a melting point of around 90\u00b0C. Adding a phenyl group typically increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi interactions between aromatic rings. The phenyl group is expected to increase the melting point by around 60\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The imidazole ring introduces nitrogen atoms, which can form hydrogen bonds, increasing the melting point significantly. The presence of a phenyl group also increases the melting point due to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and increased molecular rigidity. The imidazole ring itself can be considered as a modified benzene ring with nitrogen atoms, which would increase the melting point by approximately +100\u00b0C compared to benzene. The phenyl group adds another +40\u00b0C due to its aromatic nature and increased molecular weight.\n##Prediction: 155.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
