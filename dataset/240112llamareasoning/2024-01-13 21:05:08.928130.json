    "Reason": "The compound (17beta)-17-Hydroxyandrost-4-en-3-one, also known as testosterone, has a structure that can be broken down by its functional groups for the purpose of melting point prediction. Starting with the base structure of the steroid nucleus, which typically has a high melting point due to its rigid and planar structure, we can add the effects of functional groups. First, we need a base melting point for the steroid nucleus; steroids such as androstane have melting points ranging typically around 100-120\u00b0C. Adding the effects of functional groups: The hydroxyl group (-OH) at the 17-position can form hydrogen bonds, increasing the melting point, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The keto group (=O) at the 3-position also influences the melting point through dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding, contributing an additional +15\u00b0C. However, there is significant steric hindrance and a lack of extended conjugation in the molecule, which might reduce the melting point compared to more planar aromatic compounds. We will need to consider a slight decrease due to this, approximately -5\u00b0C.",
