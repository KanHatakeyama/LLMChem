    "Reason": "The compound 5-(a-phenylethyl)semioxamazide has structural components that affect its melting point. Starting with urea as the base structure, which typically has a melting point of around 133\u00b0C because of its capacity for strong hydrogen bonds. The attached phenyl group would typically increase the melting point around +30\u00b0C due to additional pi-pi stacking interactions and enhanced Van der Waals forces. An ethyl group's presence could slightly lower the melting point due to increased molecular flexibility; however, this effect is relatively minor in the presence of other, stronger intermolecular forces and is estimated to affect about -5\u00b0C. Other contributing features such as additional amide linkages are already incorporated within the basic urea structure's contribution. By summing the estimated changes due to these functional groups, the predicted melting point can be calculated.",
