    "Reason": "The molecule (3,3-dimethyl-3H-indol-2-yl)(phenyl)methanone consists of several functional groups that affect its melting point. The base structure can be considered as the indole moiety, which has a melting point of around 52\u00b0C. The presence of the phenyl group through a methanone linkage is expected to increase the melting point due to added rigidity and possible intermolecular interactions like \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. This could add about +20\u00b0C. Furthermore, the two methyl groups on the indole, due to steric hindrance and increased molecular weight, might further increase the melting point. Each methyl group could contribute an increase of around +5\u00b0C. However, since they are both on the same carbon, the incremental increase due to the second methyl might be less. Adjusting for this, the second methyl group might contribute +3\u00b0C instead of +5\u00b0C.",
