    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of Nystatin, the impact of various functional groups on the molecule's melting point needs to be accounted for: \n - The basic polyketide structure has multiple rings and is expected to exhibit a higher melting point due to rigidity and hydrogen bonding, estimated at around 130 degrees.\n - Hydroxyl groups contribute significantly to the melting point through hydrogen bonding. With around 10 such groups and an estimated increase of 5 degrees per hydroxyl group, we can add 50 degrees.\n - The carboxyl group adds polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability; an increase of 20 degrees is estimated due to this group.\n - The amino group also participates in hydrogen bonding, adding around 10 degrees.\n - Linkages like ether groups from acetal structures increase rigidity and polarity, which could add about 10 degrees for all such linkages combined.\n - Minor nonpolar groups like methyl may slightly reduce the overall melting point, but given the complexity of Nystatin, their effect is considered negligible.\nBy combining these increments to the base value, we have: Base (130) + Hydroxyls (50) + Carboxyl (20) + Amino (10) + Ethers (10) = 220 degrees. However, because of the possibility of such effects overlapping and the overall macrostructure possibly reducing the melting point, the prediction will be adjusted downwards from this cumulative estimation.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, biphenyl has a melting point of 70\u00b0C.\n- Each chlorophenyl group (phenyl with a chlorine substituent) is expected to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorophenyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C.\n- The presence of a lactone ring (cyclic ester) in the molecule can increase the melting point due to the rigidity of the ring and potential for hydrogen bonding. This is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10\u00b0C.\n- The presence of a long alkyl chain (nystatin) can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. This is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15\u00b0C.\n- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. Each hydroxyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 5\u00b0C.\n- The presence of a nitrogen atom in the ring can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. This is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 5\u00b0C.\n- The overall molecular complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups contribute to a higher melting point.\n##Prediction: 170.0\n##Reason",
