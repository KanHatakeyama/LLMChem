    "Reason": "The compound iminodibenzyl can be considered as a biphenyl derivative with two key modifications: the addition of an ethylene bridge and a secondary amine group. For biphenyl, with a melting point of 71\u00b0C, the ethylene bridge introduces rigidity by restricting rotation, which usually increases the melting point. The increment from each -CH2- in the ethylene bridge might be estimated at around 5\u00b0C, resulting in an increase of 10\u00b0C. The secondary amine can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly elevates the melting point. However, an increase of 35\u00b0C for the introduction of a secondary amine group seems overestimated. A more conservative estimate would be 20\u00b0C for the secondary amine group, balancing the capacity for hydrogen bonding with the broader structural context of the molecule. Hence, the combined effect of the ethylene bridge and the amine group is predicted to be +30\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two benzene rings in iminodibenzyl increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for pi-pi stacking interactions between the rings, which can be estimated at +50\u00b0C for each ring. \n- The imine (C=N) group is polar and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, which typically increases the melting point. This effect can be estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular structure is complex and rigid, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, further increasing the melting point. This effect can be estimated at +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the N-methyl group on the imine may slightly increase the melting point due to the additional methyl group providing a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall prediction is the sum of these effects.\n##Prediction: 90.0\n##Reason",
