    "Reason": "The basic comparison molecule thiadiazole has a melting point of approximately 91\u00b0C. The addition of an amino group (-NH2) brings the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which substantially raises the melting point; this is quantified as approximately +30\u00b0C. An ethylthio group (-SCH2CH3) increases the molecular weight and size, leading to enhanced van der Waals forces and a more substantial crystal lattice, which can be estimated to increase the melting point by about +11\u00b0C. Therefore, the combined effects of both functional groups should be considered additively for the prediction.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound 2-amino-5-ethylthio-1,3,4-thiadiazole contains several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic unit, thiadiazole, has a melting point around 100-110 degrees Celsius. The presence of an amino group typically increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The ethylthio group is an alkylthio group, which is less bulky than an alkyl group but still contributes to the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The thiadiazole ring itself is a rigid and planar structure that can facilitate strong intermolecular interactions, which can be estimated at +30 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 150.0\n\n##Prediction",
