    "Reason": "The base unit for comparison is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius. Adding a tert-butyl group, which is a bulky substituent, will increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance which can enhance the crystal packing efficiency. The tert-butyl group is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately 40-45 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Tert-butyl group: +40\u00b0C (due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces). \n- Carboxylic acid group: +100\u00b0C (due to strong hydrogen bonding and dimerization). \n- The combined effects of these functional groups should be considered to predict the melting point of 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid.\n##Prediction: 155.0\n##Reason",
