    "Reason": "Base compound, benzene has a melting point of 5.5 Celsius. Each methyl group individually raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces; however, the substituents are in a 1,3,5- pattern, which allows the molecule to maintain a fairly symmetric structure and pack efficiently. The methyl groups will also slightly increase molecular weight and size. Methyl group effect on benzene's melting point is roughly +5 Celsius per group.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Each methyl group on a benzene ring generally lowers the melting point due to the introduction of bulk and steric hindrance, which disrupts the crystalline packing. The effect of a methyl group on benzene is typically around -10\u00b0C. Since there are three methyl groups, the combined effect would be -30\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: -30.0\n\n##Prediction",
