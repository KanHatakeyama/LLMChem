    "Reason": "The compound 1-methyl-4-carboxy-2-pyrrolidone contains several functional groups that will affect its melting point. Starting with pyrrolidone as the base structure, which has a melting point of about 25\u00b0C, the addition of functional groups will modify this value. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) provides a strong potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can significantly increase the melting point; we can estimate this increase to be around +100\u00b0C considering the intermolecular interactions and dimerization it may cause. The amide bond within the pyrrolidone ring also contributes to the melting point with its own potential for hydrogen bonding. Given the rigid cyclic structure, which restricts rotation and can enhance the effect of hydrogen bonding, this might add approximately +25\u00b0C. The methyl group can increase the melting point slightly due to the larger molecular weight and the increment in van der Waals forces, possibly contributing a small value such as +2\u00b0C. In total, the significant effects come from the strong hydrogen bonding capabilities of the carboxylic acid and amide groups, while the methyl group offers only a minor increase. Since molecular symmetry, potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding, and crystal packing factors also affect the melting point, the added estimates might not be linear but should give a close approximation.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyrrolidone has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. \n- Carboxylic acid group: +50\u00b0C (due to strong hydrogen bonding and dimerization) \n- Methyl group: +5\u00b0C (due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions) \n- The presence of the pyrrolidone ring introduces rigidity and planarity, which can increase the melting point. However, the effect of the pyrrolidone ring is already accounted for in the base value of pyrrolidone. \nTherefore, the overall prediction is the sum of the effects of the functional groups.\n##Prediction: 155.0\n##Reason",
