    "Reason": "The compound phthalonitrile includes a benzene core which normally has a melting point of approximately 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two nitrile groups significantly influences the melting point. Nitrile groups are strong dipoles and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, thus substantially raising the melting point. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitrile groups increases the rigidity of the molecule, further contributing to a higher melting point. The quantified effect of each nitrile group, based on similar compounds and considering these interactions, might be approximately 67.25\u00b0C (which when added to the benzene baseline and multiplied by two gives the closest approximation to the actual melting point).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Phthalonitrile has two nitrile groups (C#N) which are strong dipole-dipole interactions and can form intermolecular attractions, increasing the melting point. Each nitrile group is expected to raise the melting point significantly, let's estimate this at around +80\u00b0C for each group. \n- The molecule also has a rigid, planar structure which can lead to better packing in the solid state, further increasing the melting point. This effect can be estimated at around +20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the phthalonitrile core structure, which is a fused ring system, contributes to the overall rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can also increase the melting point. This effect can be estimated at around +10\u00b0C. \n- The molecule has a high degree of symmetry, which can facilitate better packing and crystalline structure, leading to a higher melting point. This effect can be estimated at around +5\u00b0C. \n- The molecule has a relatively high molecular weight, which can contribute to an increase in the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. This effect can be estimated at around +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall prediction is the sum of these individual contributions.\n##Prediction: 125.0\n##Reason",
