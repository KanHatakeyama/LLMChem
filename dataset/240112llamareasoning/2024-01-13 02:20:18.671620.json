    "Reason": "Starting from the basic unit benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, the introduction of a cyano (-C\u2261N) group contributes significantly to the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature and capacity to form dipoles, potentially increasing the melting point by +80 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the bromomethyl (-CH2Br) group, with its heavy bromine atom, is likely to further increase the melting point by approximately +15 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and polar interactions it brings to the molecule. Summing these effects, we arrive at an estimated melting point for the molecule.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Nitrile group: +40\u00b0C (due to the strong dipole and potential for dipole-dipole interactions). \n- Bromomethyl group: +20\u00b0C (due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces). \n- The presence of the bromine atom, which is a heavy halogen, will also increase the melting point due to its high atomic weight and the polarizability of the bromine-carbon bond, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces. This effect can be estimated at +15\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecule is more rigid and planar due to the presence of the bromomethyl group, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, further increasing the melting point. This effect can be estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the nitrile group and the bromomethyl group will also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which are not accounted for in the initial estimates. This effect can be estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The cumulative effect of these functional groups is expected to increase the melting point significantly from the base value of benzene.\n##Prediction: 85.0\n##Reason",
