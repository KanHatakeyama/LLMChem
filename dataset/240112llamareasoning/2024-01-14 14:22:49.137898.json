    "Reason": "The basic unit for our compound is benzene which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Bromine, being a halogen, is generally much heavier and larger than hydrogen on the benzene ring causing an increase in intermolecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces. Each bromine substituent would significantly raise the melting point due to these increased forces. Let's estimate the increase to be around +40\u00b0C for each bromine atom, noting that the resonance effect of the benzene might also stabilize the compound and contribute slightly to the melting point elevation.",
