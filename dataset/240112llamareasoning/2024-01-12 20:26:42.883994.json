    "Reason": "To estimate the melting point of carbamylhydrazine, we consider the base molecule hydrazine, which has a melting point of 2 degrees Celsius. An amide group, when introduced into a molecular structure, can significantly raise the melting point due to its capacity for hydrogen bonding; for example, acetamide exhibits an increase of around +77 degrees Celsius over corresponding amines. The additional amine group on carbamylhydrazine likely further contributes to this increase, as amines can also form hydrogen bonds, although to a lesser extent than amides. Taking into account an amide's influence and the presence of an extra amine functional group, the contribution to the melting point might be estimated. We might assume that the amide group raises the melting point by +77 degrees Celsius compared to a simple amine, while the extra amino function might add another +10 to +15 degrees Celsius, based on typical hydrogen bonding contributions of simple alkylamines.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, hydrazine has a melting point of -11.5\u00b0C. \n- Carbamyl group (NC(=O)H): This group is known to increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the rigidity it introduces to the molecule. The carbamyl group can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 100\u00b0C. \n- Nitrogen in the hydrazine ring: The presence of nitrogen in the ring contributes to the melting point through the potential for hydrogen bonding and the rigidity it introduces to the molecule. The nitrogen in the hydrazine ring can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 5\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecule is symmetrical and has a planar structure, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, further increasing the melting point. This effect can be estimated to add another 5\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 90.0\n##Reason",
