    "Reason": "The target compound (3Z)-3-{[5-(4-bromophenyl)furan-2-yl]methylidene}-5-(2-methylpropyl)furan-2(3H)-one has several structural features that affect its melting point. Starting from the base unit of furan, which has a melting point of around -85.6\u00b0C, we consider the effects of each substituent: \n1. The 4-bromophenyl group is a large, heavy substituent that significantly increases the molecular weight and adds rigidity to the molecule, considerably raising the melting point relative to furan. Estimating an increase of about +160\u00b0C due to the increased molecular interactions and steric hindrance.\n2. The methylidene linkage (a form of alkene) adds some molecular rigidity but has less impact compared to bromophenyl. Estimate an increase of about +15\u00b0C.\n3. The 2-methylpropyl group adds to the molecular weight and provides some steric bulk, but it's not as significant as the bromophenyl group. Estimate an increase of about +10\u00b0C.\n4. The presence of another furan ring would normally decrease the melting point since furan itself has a low melting point, but its incorporation into the rigid structure with an additional keto group (OC1=O) adds to the overall symmetry and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, not significantly altering the predicted increase.\nOverall, the compound's large size, branched structure, and heavy atoms would result in a combined estimated increase from furan's melting point.",
