    "Reason": "The base unit for comparison is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius. Adding a tert-butyl group, which is a bulky substituent, will increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance which can enhance the crystal packing efficiency. The tert-butyl group is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately 40-45 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid consists of a benzene ring, a tert-butyl group, and a carboxylic acid functional group. The benzene ring provides a basic unit with a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The tert-butyl group is a large, bulky group that increases the molecular weight and size, which typically raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions. This effect can be estimated at around +40 \u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group is capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. This effect can be estimated at around +100 \u00b0C. The combined effect of these groups should result in a higher melting point than the base benzene unit.\n##Prediction: 155.0\n\n##Prediction",
