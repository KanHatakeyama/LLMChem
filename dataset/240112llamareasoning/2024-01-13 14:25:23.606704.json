    "Reason": "The base unit of methane has a melting point of -182 degrees Celsius. The extension of the carbon chain for a dodecane structure contributes to an increase in the melting point due to the increase in van der Waals forces. Approximately, each additional methylene group (except for the first few) can contribute an increase of around 20 degrees Celsius. Moreover, the presence of the thiol group (SH) can both contribute to van der Waals interactions and potentially introduce weak intermolecular hydrogen bonding which further increases the melting point. Considering dodecane has a melting point around -10 degrees Celsius, the addition of a thiol could add a small increase, estimated at around 3 degrees Celsius.",
