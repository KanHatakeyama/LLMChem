    "Reason": "The basic unit indole has an estimated melting point in the range of 52\u00b0C. Adding a nitro group increases the melting point due to the introduction of a strong electron-withdrawing group that can form additional intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding with the NH or OH groups of adjacent molecules (+80). Carboxylic acid groups are known to raise the melting point significantly because they can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds (+130). Thus, the presence of both a nitro and a carboxylic acid group in the compound would have a cumulative effect.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for the target compound is indole, which has a melting point of around 100 \u00b0C. The functional groups present in the target compound include a nitro group, a carboxylic acid group, and an amide group. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group that can significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular interactions, estimated at +50. The carboxylic acid group can form strong hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point by about +30. The amide group can also form hydrogen bonds, but to a lesser extent than carboxylic acids, estimated at +20. The presence of these groups will significantly increase the melting point compared to the base indole structure.\n##Prediction: 250.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
