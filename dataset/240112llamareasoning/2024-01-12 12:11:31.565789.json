    "Reason": "The basic unit to consider is pyrazole which has a melting point around 70\u00b0C. The addition of methyl groups tends to increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals forces. Each methyl group in a heteroaromatic compound might contribute approximately +10 to +20\u00b0C to the melting point because they provide more surface area for molecular interactions, and sterically hinder rotation around the molecule making it more rigid. Therefore, having two methyl groups should increase the melting point as compared to the base structure.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyrazole has a melting point of around 70\u00b0C. \n- Methyl groups: Each methyl group typically raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, in this case, the presence of the nitrogen in the ring may slightly reduce the effect of the methyl groups. Let's estimate the effect of each methyl group to be around +5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the nitrogen in the ring also contributes to the melting point through its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. This could increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. \n- The overall structure of the molecule, including the ring system and the presence of nitrogen, contributes to a higher melting point due to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can facilitate better packing in the solid state. This could add another +10\u00b0C. \n- The combined effects of the methyl groups and the nitrogen in the ring should be considered cumulatively.\n##Prediction: 95.0\n##Reason",
