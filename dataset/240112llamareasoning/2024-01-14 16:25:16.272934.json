    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 1-Methyl-1-nitrosourea, we will consider the functional groups present and their contribution to the melting point. The basic unit here could be urea, which has a melting point of about 133\u00b0C. The nitroso group tends to lower the melting point due to less efficient packing, we can estimate each nitroso group to reduce the melting point by about -20\u00b0C. A methyl group usually raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces; we can estimate each methyl group to add around +5\u00b0C. 1-Methyl-1-nitrosourea has one nitroso group and one methyl group. Thus: \n133\u00b0C (urea base) - 20\u00b0C (nitroso group) + 5\u00b0C (methyl group) = 118\u00b0C.",
