    "Reason": "Starting with aniline which has a melting point of -6\u00b0C, we analyze the main functional groups in flufenamic acid: the carboxylic acid group introduces strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which would significantly raise the melting point by an estimated +100\u00b0C; the trifluoromethyl group contributes to the melting point through strong electronegative fluorine atoms, adding about +20\u00b0C; the amino group linked to benzene is part of the baseline molecule of aniline, and so its effect on the melting point is already accounted for in the starting value. Additional substituents on the benzene rings would collectively contribute +10\u00b0C due to their impact on molecular symmetry and crystal packing. The overall planar structure of the compound can aid in efficient molecular packing, which is often associated with higher melting points, estimated to add another +5\u00b0C. Therefore, by summing up these estimated increments, we predict the melting point for flufenamic acid.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. \n- The presence of the amide group (-CONH-) typically increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the rigidity it introduces to the molecule; this effect might be around +100 degrees Celsius. \n- The presence of the fluorine atoms (-F) increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity and the ability to form dipole-dipole interactions; this effect might be around +20 degrees Celsius for each fluorine atom. \n- The presence of the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the nitrogen in the amide might slightly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; this effect might be around +5 degrees Celsius. \n- The presence of the ethyl group (-C2H4) attached to the nitrogen in the amide might also increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; this effect might be around +5 degrees Celsius. \n- The overall molecular structure is complex and includes multiple functional groups that can interact with each other, which could lead to a higher melting point than the sum of the individual effects. \n##Prediction: 130.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
