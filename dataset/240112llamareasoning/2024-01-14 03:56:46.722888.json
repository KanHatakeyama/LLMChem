    "Reason": "The compound diphenolin acid consists of a structure similar to biphenyl with two phenolic -OH groups and a tertiary butyl group attached to one of the phenyl rings and a propanoic acid group (-CCC(=O)O) on the other side. The benzene ring as a base unit has a melting point around 5-6\u00b0C. Each phenolic -OH group will increase the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds (+40 each). The tertiary butyl group is bulky and sterically hinders close packing, slightly decreasing the melting point (-5). The propanoic acid group allows for dimerization through hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point (+100). Combining these contributions, the predicted melting point for diphenolin acid should be the sum of the effects from the functional groups: 5(base) + 40(-OH) + 40(-OH) - 5(tertiary butyl) + 100(propanoic acid group) = 180\u00b0C.",
