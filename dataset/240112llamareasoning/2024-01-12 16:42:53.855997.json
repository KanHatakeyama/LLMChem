    "Reason": "The target compound, sec-butylacetate, can be decomposed into its functional groups for analysis. The basic structural unit, ethyl acetate, has a melting point of -83.6 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group in ethyl acetate would be modified to a sec-butyl group (sec-C4H9-) in sec-butylacetate. The sec-butyl group is larger than the ethyl group, which increases the molecular weight and provides more surface area for van der Waals interactions, thus raising the melting point. However, the branching in the sec-butyl group reduces the effectiveness of van der Waals forces compared to a straight chain, which ultimately leads to a decrease in melting point. Considering these factors, the increase in molecular weight might contribute an approximate +5 degrees Celsius shift due to the larger group, whereas the branching might contribute a decrease of -20 degrees Celsius due to decreased packing efficiency. Combined, this would result in a predicted melting point shift of -15 degrees Celsius compared to ethyl acetate.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethyl acetate has a melting point of -85.6\u00b0C. \n- The addition of a methyl group to form sec-butyl acetate increases the molecular weight and the van der Waals forces, which typically raises the melting point. This effect can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. \n- The acetyl group (C(=O)O) is already accounted for in the base unit of ethyl acetate. \n- The sec-butyl group (C4H9) adds steric hindrance and bulkiness, which can disrupt the crystal lattice, potentially lowering the melting point. This effect can be estimated to decrease the melting point by about 10\u00b0C. \n- The overall effect of the sec-butyl group is expected to be a net decrease in the melting point due to the disruption of the crystal lattice.\n##Prediction: -95.0\n##Reason",
