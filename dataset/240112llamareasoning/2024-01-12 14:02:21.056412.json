    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of two acetyl groups is likely to significantly increase the melting point due to the ability of the polar carbonyl groups to engage in dipole-dipole interactions, and potentially to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, leading to a more ordered solid phase and an increased melting point; let's estimate this increase to be +50\u00b0C for each acetyl group contribution. The presence of the para methyl group also raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, albeit to a lesser extent. This is estimated to be a +5\u00b0C increase for the methyl group effect. With two acetyl groups, the combined added effect is 2 x 50\u00b0C = 100\u00b0C, and the single methyl group adds +5\u00b0C.",
