    "Reason": "The basic structure to consider is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of the amine (NH2) group to benzene generally increases the melting point because of the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can significantly raise the melting point, let's estimate this effect at about +50\u00b0C due to these interactions. The 4-tert-butyl (1,1-dimethylethyl) group, however, is large and bulky, which might disrupt crystal packing and slightly lower the melting point. Given that bulky groups can hinder solid packing, let's estimate the effect of the t-butyl group to be quite significant at -40\u00b0C. By combining these effects, we can make the prediction for the melting point of the target compound.",
