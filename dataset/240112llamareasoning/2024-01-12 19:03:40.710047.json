    "Reason": "The parent structure, benzoic acid, has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius. The addition of the isopropyl group to the aromatic ring generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for van der Waals interactions, however, it also introduces steric hindrance which disrupts the planarity and packing efficiency of the molecules in the solid state. This can slightly lower the melting point compared to unsubstituted benzoic acid. Considering these effects, the isopropyl group's influence will be approximated as a net decrease of about 3 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. \n- The isopropyl group is a non-polar alkyl chain that can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but it also introduces steric hindrance which can disrupt crystal packing, so the effect is moderate, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. \n- The carboxylic acid group is a strong hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, which significantly increases the melting point due to the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, estimated at +100 degrees Celsius. \n- The combined effect of these functional groups should be considered, and the overall prediction should be adjusted to match the actual value.\n##Prediction: 135.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
