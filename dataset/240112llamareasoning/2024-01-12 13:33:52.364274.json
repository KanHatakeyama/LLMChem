    "Reason": "The target compound, Metaraminol, has several functional groups that will affect its melting point. The base structure is a benzene ring, which typically contributes to a more stable and higher melting point due to its aromaticity. Phenol has a melting point around 41\u00b0C, thus providing a starting point as it contains a benzene ring with an -OH substituent. From here, we analyze the effects of each additional functional group: The primary amine (NH2) group, when attached to a benzene ring, raises the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding; this effect might contribute approximately +30\u00b0C. The additional -OH group in the ortho position to the first one also increases the melting point by a similar mechanism, potentially adding another +30\u00b0C. The methyl group (CH3) attached to an aliphatic carbon chain generally raises the melting point by adding Van der Waals forces and increasing molecular weight; this effect could add around +5\u00b0C. The combined influence of the hydroxyl groups and the amine group fostering strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, as well as the methyl group's Van der Waals interactions, must lead to a high melting point. However, these individual contributions are estimated and could vary in actuality. The stereochemistry also plays a role, but this effect is not easily quantified without specific data.",
