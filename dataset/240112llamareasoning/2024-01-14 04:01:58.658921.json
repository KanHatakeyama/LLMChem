    "Reason": "The basic unit pyridine has a melting point of around -42 degrees Celsius. The amide functional group, which is -C(=O)N, typically increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and increased dipole moment. For small molecules, an amide group can increase the melting point significantly depending on its position and the molecule's overall structure. Given that amides can increase the melting point by approximately +100 to +150 degrees Celsius due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization of the amide bond, this effect can be expected here. Additionally, the substitution at the 2-position of the pyridine may further increase the rigidity of the molecule, contributing to a higher melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyridine has a melting point of around 20\u00b0C. \n- Carboxamide group: +100\u00b0C (due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and the presence of a planar, rigid structure which enhances the crystal lattice energy). \n- The amide group also contributes to the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding with other molecules. \n- The pyridine ring itself is aromatic and has a certain degree of rigidity, which can also increase the melting point. \n- The presence of the amide group and the aromatic ring system contributes to a higher melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for intermolecular interactions.\n##Prediction: 120.0\n##Reason",
