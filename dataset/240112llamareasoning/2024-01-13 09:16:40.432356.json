    "Reason": "The base unit ethanol has a melting point of -114.1 \u00b0C. Adding a bromine atom will increase this value because bromine adds significant molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. However, the hydroxyl group (-OH) in ethanol is capable of hydrogen bonding, which typically raises the melting point. Since 2-bromoethanol retains the hydroxyl group, the hydrogen bonding persists. Therefore the increase in melting point due to the bromine atom will be somewhat counterbalanced by the existing effect of the hydroxyl group. Relative to hydrogen, bromine's larger atomic size and higher atomic weight tend to increase the melting point by approximately +30 units. Taking all these into consideration, we adjust the base melting point of ethanol upward to reflect the addition of bromine.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethanol: Ethanol has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C.\n- Bromine atom: Bromine is a large, heavy atom that increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which typically raises the melting point. We can estimate this increase to be around 40\u00b0C.\n- Hydroxyl group: The hydroxyl group is capable of forming hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. We can estimate this increase to be around 40\u00b0C as well.\nCombining these effects, we predict the melting point of 2-bromoethanol.\n##Prediction: -74.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
