    "Reason": "The compound 10-methylgon-8-ene-3,17-dione has multiple functional groups that influence its melting point: \n1) Methyl group typically increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. A reasonable estimate for the addition of a methyl group would be +5\u00b0C.\n2) Ketone groups (carbonyl groups =C=O) increase melting point by introducing potential sites for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. On average, a ketone group might increase the melting point by +20\u00b0C. Since there are two ketone groups, the combined contribution would be +40\u00b0C.\n3) The presence of a double bond slightly lowers the melting point due to less efficient molecular packing. This effect can be estimated at -5\u00b0C.\nAssuming a base melting point for a steroidal structure similar to gonane is about 100\u00b0C (since they generally have high melting points due to rigid structure), individual contributions can be added to this base value.",
