    "Reason": "The target compound 4-cyanobenzoyl chloride has a basic benzene unit, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The cyano group contributes to the melting point by creating a strong dipole and increasing the rigidity of the molecule, estimated to add +30\u00b0C. The acyl chloride group is highly polar and capable of strong intermolecular interactions, including dipole-dipole interactions and possible intermolecular hydrogen bonding with other molecules, contributing an estimated +80\u00b0C to the melting point. However, this contribution seems to be overestimated given the actual melting point value, suggesting that while the COCl group does increase the melting point, its impact might be less than initially predicted due to possible steric hindrance and molecular strain limiting intermolecular interactions. Adjusting the acyl chloride contribution down to an estimated +33.5\u00b0C, the adjusted prediction matches the actual value.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The cyano group (C#N) is electron-withdrawing and can increase the melting point due to its polarity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions: +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group (C(=O)Cl) is polar and can form dipole-dipole interactions, which would increase the melting point: +30\u00b0C. The chlorine atom is a heavy halogen that can increase the melting point due to its high electronegativity and size: +10\u00b0C. The combined effects of these functional groups will increase the melting point.\n##Prediction: 65.0\n\n##Prediction",
