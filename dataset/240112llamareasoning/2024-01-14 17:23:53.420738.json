    "Reason": "The basic unit for our comparison here is proline, which has a melting point around 221 degrees Celsius. The modifications to consider on this proline derivative are the acetyl group and the hydroxy group. Typically, acetyl groups tend to lower the melting point due to their potential to disrupt hydrogen bonding in the solid state compared to the carboxylic acid they may replace or the amine they may acetylate. However, since this is a trans-configuration, there might be some kind of stabilization due to the rigidity of the molecule, but not enough to increase the melting point significantly. We can estimate this effect to be approximately -60 degrees Celsius. The hydroxy group generally increases the melting point because of the increased capacity for hydrogen bonding, but since proline already has a secondary amine and a carboxyl, the additional hydroxy won't increase the melting point as much as it would on a non-functionalized alkane. We can estimate this hydroxy group to contribute around +10 degrees Celsius to the melting point.",
