    "Reason": "The compound benzhydryl isothiocyanate consists of a benzene ring as its basic unit with a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of two phenyl groups significantly increases the molecular weight, contributes to pi-pi stacking and enhances van der Waals interactions, which can raise the melting point. Each phenyl group could be estimated to add around +25 \u00b0C due to these effects. The central carbon has a minimal effect and will be considered negligible. The isothiocyanate group introduces both polar character and potential for strong dipole-dipole interactions, which typically raise the melting point; its contribution might be around +10 \u00b0C owing to these properties. Adding these contributions together gives an estimated melting point as follows: 5.5 (benzene) + 25 (first phenyl) + 25 (second phenyl) + 10 (isothiocyanate group).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl rings (benzhydryl) increases the molecular weight and the rigidity of the molecule, which typically raises the melting point. Each phenyl group can be estimated to contribute an additional +20\u00b0C due to these effects. The isothiocyanate group is a strong polar functional group that can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, which can significantly increase the melting point. This group can be estimated to contribute an additional +40\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 75.0\n\n##Prediction",
