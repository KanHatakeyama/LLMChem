    "Reason": "The target compound is a derivative of cyclohexadienone with additional functional groups attached to it. Cyclohexadienone has a melting point around 105 \u00b0C (estimated from benzaldehyde which has similar structure). Each substituent will have an effect on the melting point:\n- Hydroxylamine (=NOH) group: increases melting point due to potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated as +20 \u00b0C.\n- Methyl group (CH3): slightly increases melting point due to increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated as +5 \u00b0C.\n- Isopropyl group ((CH3)2CH): substantially increases melting point, due to increase in molecular weight and steric effects, estimated as +15 \u00b0C.\nAdding these effects gives an estimated melting point shift of +40 \u00b0C to the base value of 105 \u00b0C.",
