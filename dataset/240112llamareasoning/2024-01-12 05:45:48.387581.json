    "Reason": "The basic steroid ring system in allotetrahydrocortisone contributes to a high baseline melting point due to its rigid, planar structure facilitating strong van der Waals forces. Hydroxyl groups (-OH) commonly increase the melting point because of the hydrogen bonding they can form; for allotetrahydrocortisone, with three -OH groups, this would significantly raise the melting point, estimated at +20 for each hydroxyl group. A ketone group (C=O) generally has a smaller influence on the melting point compared to hydroxyls, but still contributes some increase due to its polar nature, estimated at +5. The carboxylic acid group (COOH) present in the compound is known for strong hydrogen bonding, potentially more so than hydroxyl groups, therefore it could be estimated to increase the melting point by +30. However, given the actual value, the initial estimates seem too high.",
