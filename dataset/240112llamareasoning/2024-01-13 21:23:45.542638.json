    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of N-butylurea, we need to consider the effects of its functional groups and molecular structure. The basic unit of urea has a melting point of about 133\u00b0C, and its high melting point is due to its ability to form extensive hydrogen bonding. The N-butyl group is a hydrophobic alkyl chain, which will generally tend to lower the melting point due to a decreasing ability for hydrogen bonding as a larger hydrophobic group is added. However, the long carbon chain can increase melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. Additionally, the presence of N-butyl may also impose steric hindrance, affecting the solidity of the molecular crystal lattice. Overall, the melting point of N-butylurea can be expected to be lower than that of urea because the ability of the molecule to form a rigid hydrogen-bond network is decreased substantially. Quantitatively, the addition of N-butyl may lower the melting point of urea by around -38\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, urea has a melting point of 133\u00b0C. \n- The addition of a butyl group (C4H9) to the urea molecule will increase the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which typically raises the melting point. However, the alkyl chain also introduces flexibility and reduces the symmetry of the molecule, which can lower the melting point. The effect of the butyl group is expected to be a decrease in the melting point compared to urea. \n- The decrease in melting point due to the butyl group is estimated to be around -30\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 103.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
