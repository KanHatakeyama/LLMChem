    "Reason": "The base unit is hexane, which has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl (-OH) group generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities, which can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +100 degrees. The amino (-NH2) group also participates in hydrogen bonding, which may further increase the melting point by around +50 degrees. However, primary amine group effect can be slightly less than hydroxyl group's enhancement due to its less electronegativity.",
