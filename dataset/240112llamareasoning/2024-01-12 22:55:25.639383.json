    "Reason": "The base structure to consider is naphthalene, which has a melting point of 80.5\u00b0C. Bromine substituents generally increase the melting point because of their large atomic mass and the induction of polarizability, which enhances intermolecular forces like London dispersion forces. The symmetry of 1,4-dibromonaphthalene also contributes to its higher melting point, since symmetric molecules tend to pack more efficiently in the solid state and thus raise the temperature required to disrupt the lattice. Each bromine is expected to increase the melting point slightly, but given the actual value is very close to the melting point of naphthalene, the increase is minimal. The effect of each bromine on the melting point is calculated to be about +0.25\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The target compound is 1,4-dibromonaphthalene, which is a naphthalene ring with two bromine atoms. Naphthalene has a melting point of 80.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of bromine atoms increases the melting point due to their large atomic size and the resulting increase in van der Waals forces. Each bromine atom can be estimated to contribute an additional +20 degrees Celsius to the melting point.\n##Prediction: 100.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
