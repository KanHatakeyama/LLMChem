    "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of around 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of a hydroxyl (-OH) group to the pyridine ring will increase the melting point due to the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds significantly increase the energy required to melt a compound, and a hydroxyl group could elevate the melting point by around 140\u00b0C because of the strong hydrogen bonding it introduces. Moreover, the attachment of the -OH group to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle further increases the melting point by enhancing molecular rigidity and polarity.",

The effect of a hydroxyl group on the melting point of a compound can be significant, potentially adding around +40\u00b0C to the melting point. \n- The presence of the hydroxyl group also introduces the possibility of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point.\n##Prediction: 150.0\n##Reason",
