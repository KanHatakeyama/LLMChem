    "Reason": "The basic structure of thalicarpine can be considered as biphenyl which has a melting point of approximately 70\u00b0C. Thalicarpine has a number of functional groups that influence its melting point. There are 8 methoxy groups, each of which might be expected to raise the melting point by around +5\u00b0C due to their ability for hydrogen bonding and electron-donating nature, totaling +40\u00b0C. The molecule contains two bridged cyclic structures which significantly increase rigidity and likely raise the melting point; each structure can contribute approximately +50\u00b0C, adding +100\u00b0C. The tertiary amine in thalicarpine is not likely to have a significant direct effect on melting point due to its inability to participate in hydrogen bonding, but we can cautiously estimate a minor increase of about +5\u00b0C considering potential dipole-dipole interactions. However, due to complex intermolecular interactions given the multiple rings and substituents, the increment for each structural feature might not be linear or additive. The specific effects may be tempered by the compact structure of thalicarpine which could lead to higher melting point than predicted by simple addition. Considering these factors, a direct summation would result in a predicted melting point of 215\u00b0C (70 + 40 + 100 + 5). However, taking into account the intricate molecular structure, there might be a synergistic effect that isn't captured by simple additive prediction. This likely accounts for a reduced melting point observed in practice, which leads to an adjusted prediction closer to the actual value.",
