    "Reason": "The target compound n-(2-methylphenyl)acetamide contains a benzene ring, an acetamide group, and a methyl group. The base melting point is set by the benzene ring, which has a low melting point due to its symmetry and stability, typically around 5.5\u00b0C. The acetamide group is capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. This effect might be estimated at around +100\u00b0C due to the fact that amides generally have much higher melting points than benzene because of strong dipole-dipole interactions and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The methyl group attached to the benzene ring increases the molecular weight and provides additional van der Waals forces, however, it would disrupt the symmetry of the benzene ring and thus might not contribute as much to the melting point as other functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding. The methyl group's effect might be estimated at around +5\u00b0C due to the relatively minor impact on the compound's overall polarity and ability to engage in intermolecular interactions. Thus, combining the effects of the acetamide and the methyl group with the base melting point of benzene, the total estimated increase in melting point would be +105\u00b0C.",
