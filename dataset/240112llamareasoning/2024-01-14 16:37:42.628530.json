    "Reason": "The basic structure quinoline has a melting point of around 23 degrees Celsius. For 2-aminoquinoline, the amino group on the quinoline core has two significant effects: (1) It increases the polarity of the molecule, leading to stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which typically raises the melting point due to higher energy required to overcome these interactions. The contribution of this could be estimated at around +80 degrees Celsius. (2) The introduction of a nitrogen atom also results in a resonant structure with an expanded conjugated system, enhancing the rigidity of the molecule, which can also increase the melting point. This effect could contribute an additional +30 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, quinoline has a melting point of around 23\u00b0C. \n- The amino group (-NH2) is capable of hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. This effect can be estimated to add approximately +100\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the amino group also introduces steric hindrance and increases the molecular weight, which can further increase the melting point. This effect can be estimated to add another +20\u00b0C. \n- The overall structure of the molecule is rigid and planar, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, potentially increasing the melting point. This effect can be estimated to add +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the nitrogen in the ring can also contribute to the melting point through resonance stabilization and potential hydrogen bonding, which can be estimated to add +5\u00b0C. \n- The combined effects of these functional groups and structural features lead to an increase in the melting point compared to the basic quinoline unit.\n##Prediction: 135.0\n##Reason",
