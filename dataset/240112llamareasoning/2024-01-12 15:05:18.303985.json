    "Reason": "The basic unit here is indole, which has a melting point of around 52\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group (CH3) to the molecule tends to increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular size and van der Waals forces. However, indole's melting point is also determined by resonance stability and hydrogen bonding capabilities of the NH group. Methyl substituents on an aromatic ring typically raise the melting point by about 20 to 30\u00b0C under standard conditions, but the resonance stabilization and hydrogen bonding in indole may reduce this effect. Therefore, we could conservatively estimate the contribution of the methyl group to be around +10\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Methyl group: +20\u00b0C (due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces). \n- Indole ring: +40\u00b0C (due to the rigid, planar structure and the ability to stack well, which increases the melting point). \n- The presence of the indole ring and the methyl group will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the molecule. However, the indole ring is aromatic, which can lead to a higher melting point due to \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions.\n##Prediction: 65.0\n##Reason",
