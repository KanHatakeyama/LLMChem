    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of sulfamerazine, we need to consider the effects of the individual functional groups present in its molecular structure. The basic unit we can compare with is aniline, which has a melting point of -6 \u00b0C. Starting from there, we add contributions from various functional groups: \n- Sulfonamide group (S(=O)2N-), which is typically a strong electron-withdrawing group and forms strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This can significantly increase the melting point. Estimation: +140 \u00b0C.\n- Pyrimidine ring contributes to the rigidity of the molecule and can thus increase the melting point due to more shape persistence. Estimation: +70 \u00b0C. \n- Methyl group attached to the pyrimidine ring can increase the lowest steric hindrance but could also promote van der Waals interactions slightly, leading to a moderate increase in the melting point. Estimation: +10 \u00b0C. \nCombining the aniline base value with the effects of these functional groups, we estimate a total sum for the melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. \n- The sulfonamide group (-S(=O)2N-) is a strong electron-withdrawing group that can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, significantly increasing the melting point. This effect might be around +100 degrees Celsius. \n- The amide group (-CONH-) also contributes to hydrogen bonding and has a similar effect as the sulfonamide group, adding around +100 degrees Celsius. \n- The two phenyl rings add to the rigidity of the molecule and increase the melting point, we might estimate this effect to be around +20 degrees Celsius for each ring. \n- The presence of the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the nitrogen atom in the amide group might slightly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, we might estimate this effect to be around +5 degrees Celsius. \n##Prediction: 230.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
