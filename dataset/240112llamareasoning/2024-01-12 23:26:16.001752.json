    "Reason": "The basic structure quinoline has a melting point of around 23 degrees Celsius. For 2-aminoquinoline, the amino group on the quinoline core has two significant effects: (1) It increases the polarity of the molecule, leading to stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which typically raises the melting point due to higher energy required to overcome these interactions. The contribution of this could be estimated at around +80 degrees Celsius. (2) The introduction of a nitrogen atom also results in a resonant structure with an expanded conjugated system, enhancing the rigidity of the molecule, which can also increase the melting point. This effect could contribute an additional +30 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, quinoline, has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. \n- The presence of an amino group (NH2) generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The compound has a single additional methyl group, which may slightly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall effect of these functional groups is an increase in the melting point.\n##Prediction: 125.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
