    "Reason": "The base unit is hexane, which has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl (-OH) group generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities, which can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +100 degrees. The amino (-NH2) group also participates in hydrogen bonding, which may further increase the melting point by around +50 degrees. However, primary amine group effect can be slightly less than hydroxyl group's enhancement due to its less electronegativity.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, hexane has a melting point of -95\u00b0C. \n- The hydroxyl group (-OH) is capable of hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point; we estimate this effect to be around +100\u00b0C. \n- The amino group (-NH2) can also form hydrogen bonds, contributing an additional +50\u00b0C. \n- The alkyl chain (hexane) adds van der Waals interactions, which would increase the melting point, but to a lesser extent than the hydrogen bonding groups; we estimate this effect to be around +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular weight and the presence of multiple functional groups that can engage in hydrogen bonding will further increase the melting point. \n\nCombining these effects, we predict an increase of 155\u00b0C from the base value of hexane.\n##Prediction: 60.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
