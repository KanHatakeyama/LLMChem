    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be n-hexane, which has a melting point of -95 \u00b0C due to its straight-chain hydrocarbon structure. The presence of two carboxyl groups (COOH) on adipic acid provides hydrogen bonding capacity, which contributes to ionic interactions between molecules, greatly raising the melting point. Each carboxyl group could add approximately 120-140 \u00b0C due to the potential for forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and dipole-dipole interactions. Additionally, the presence of a flexible alkyl chain (C4) may slightly lower the melting point compared to a more rigid structure because it allows more conformational freedom, which decreases intermolecular packing efficiency. However, this effect is minimal in comparison to the effect of the carboxyl groups, so it could be estimated to subtract around 5 \u00b0C from the melting point.",
