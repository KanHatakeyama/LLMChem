    "Reason": "The ethyl isobutyrylacetate molecule is composed of several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic unit here could be taken as ethanoic acid (acetic acid) which has a melting point of 16.6\u00b0C. The ester functional group typically lowers the melting point due to the lower polarity compared to carboxylic acids, so we might estimate a decrease of about -30 degrees Celsius. But there are two ester groups, so we double the effect to -60. Additionally, there is an isobutyl group, which is a larger alkyl group, likely to provide an increase in the melting point due to the larger surface area and increased London dispersion forces. This could be estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. Lastly, an ethyl group is present which might raise the melting point further by around +2 degrees Celsius. The combined effects of these groups will predict the overall melting point of the compound.",
