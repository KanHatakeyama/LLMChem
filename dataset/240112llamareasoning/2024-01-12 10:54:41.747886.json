    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a cyano group increases molecular polarity and intermolecular forces, leading to an estimated increase of about +70\u00b0C in melting point. A nitro group also substantially raises the melting point due to its electronegativity and ability to participate in strong dipole-dipole interactions, possibly contributing an additional +40\u00b0C. There is no specific synergistic effect quantified between the cyano and nitro groups that would justify deviation from a simple additive effect; hence, these groups are treated independently in their contributions to the melting point.",
