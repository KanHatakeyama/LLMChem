    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of protionamide, we start with the basic unit, aniline, which has a melting point of -6\u00b0C. Then we quantitatively adjust for the functional groups present in the molecule. The propyl group (CCC) attached to the aromatic ring likely increases the melting point due to a larger molecular weight and increased van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The thioamide group (C(N)=S) is a strong polar functional group additionally capable of hydrogen bonding, more so than a regular amide due to the presence of sulfur, thus it can significantly raise the melting point, we can estimate this increase to be about +100\u00b0C due to the increased rigidity and significant boost in intermolecular forces. The prediction must be rethought as the totals do not match the actual recorded value of 136.7\u00b0C.",
