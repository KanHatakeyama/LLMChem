    "Reason": "The base structure for 2-methyl-4-nitrobutane is butane, with an estimated melting point of -138.3 degrees Celsius. The addition of a methyl group typically increases the melting point because of greater molecular weight and van der Waals forces; this usually results in a modest increase, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group, by contrast, has a much more substantial effect due to its greatly electronegative nature and its capacity for strong dipole-dipole interactions. The nitro group can be expected to raise the melting point significantly, estimated at +230 degrees Celsius, reflecting the strong intermolecular forces. Sorting these effects into an aggregated melting point prediction provides a value that should closely align with the actual melting point of the compound.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Base structure, butane has a melting point of -138.4\u00b0C. \n- Methyl group: +20\u00b0C (due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces). \n- Nitro group: +80\u00b0C (due to strong dipole-dipole interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding). \n- The presence of the nitro group significantly increases the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature and the potential for hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group in the nitro group. \n- The methyl group adds to the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but its effect is less pronounced than the nitro group. \n- The overall effect of the nitro group is expected to be much higher than the methyl group due to its strong intermolecular forces.\n##Prediction: 108.0\n##Reason",
