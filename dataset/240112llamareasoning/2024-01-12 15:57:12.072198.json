    "Reason": "Basic unit, cyclopentene has a melting point of -93. Cyclopentene's small ring size contributes to relatively weak intermolecular forces, resulting in a low melting point. Carboxylic acid group: +110 (because carboxylic acids engage in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, greatly increasing melting points). The addition of three methyl groups, each contributes approximately +18 due to increased van der Waals forces from the added molecular weight and the slight increase in molecular complexity. However, the presence of the double bond in the ring system slightly decreases the melting point due to less efficient packing. We can estimate this effect to be around -5. Overall, the strong hydrogen bonding from the carboxylic acid group will be the dominant factor, but the contribution from the methyl groups and the effect of the double bond must be considered as well.",
