    "Reason": "The basic unit for our comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Each chlorine atom bonded to the benzene ring increases the molecular weight and the molecular interactions such as dipole-dipole forces and Van der Waals forces, as chlorine is more electronegative compared to a hydrogen atom. This leads to a higher melting point compared to benzene. Lindane has six chlorine atoms replacing the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring. Each chlorine substitution can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 18\u00b0C (a rough approximation based on chlorinated benzene derivatives). Therefore, the expected increase due to six chlorines would be 6 * 18 = 108\u00b0C.",
