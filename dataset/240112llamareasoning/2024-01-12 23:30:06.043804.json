    "Reason": "Sulfanilamide is an aromatic compound that includes both an amine group and a sulfonamide group attached to a benzene ring. The pure benzene ring has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The amine group can be predicted to increase the melting point due to it enabling hydrogen bonding, and this effect can be quantified as approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The presence of the sulfonamide group also significantly increases the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and increased polarity; this effect can add an additional +90 degrees Celsius. The synergistic effect of these two groups on the melting point due to potential efficient crystal packing and complementary hydrogen bonding could account for an extra increase, which can be estimated conservatively as +20 degrees Celsius. The total increased melting point is the sum of these contributions.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound sulfanilamide consists of a benzene ring, a sulfonyl group, and an amide group. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group that can increase the melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular interactions, such as dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding with other molecules. The amide group is capable of hydrogen bonding, which can significantly increase the melting point. Considering these effects, the sulfanilamide's melting point can be estimated as follows: Benzene base: 5.5\u00b0C, sulfonyl group: +80\u00b0C, amide group: +100\u00b0C. This leads to an estimated total increase of 185.5\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 185.0\n\n##Prediction",
