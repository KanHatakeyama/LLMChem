    "Reason": "The melting point of pyrrole-2-carboxaldoxime can be quantitatively predicted based on the functional groups present. Starting with pyrrole as the basic unit, which has a melting point around 23\u00b0C. The carboxaldoxime functional group is composed of an aldoxime (C=NOH) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) derivative, which typically increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities and polarity. The aldoxime group can raise the melting point by approximately +90\u00b0C because of its capacity for hydrogen bonding. While the exact increase due to the carboxyl group is difficult to predict without experimental data, carboxylic acids generally raise melting points significantly through strong hydrogen bonding. Estimating an increase of about +50\u00b0C for this effect seems reasonable. Pyrrole itself, being a five-membered heterocycle with an NH, also has the ability to engage in hydrogen bonding, which is included in its base melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyrrole, has a melting point of 23\u00b0C.\n- The carboxaldoxime group is a complex functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and dimerize, estimated to be around +150\u00b0C.\n- The presence of the nitrogen in the ring can also contribute to the melting point through increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated to be around +5\u00b0C.\nCombining these effects should predict the overall melting point shift.\n##Prediction: 178.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
