    "Reason": "Cetoxime is composed of multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. Starting with a basic amine group (like in aniline, whose melting point is around -6\u00b0C), we need to consider the following modifications: The presence of a nitrile group generally raises the melting point due to the dipole-dipole interaction and potential for hydrogen bonding with the N-H of the amine; this can be estimated to add about 40-60\u00b0C. Additionally, the oxime group (C=N-OH) will further enhance hydrogen bonding capabilities, contributing to an increase in melting point, possibly adding another 20-30\u00b0C. The two phenyl rings add steric bulk and pi-pi interactions, potentially raising the melting point by a further 20-40\u00b0C each. Considering all these factors, the estimation is a summation of the base amine value and the adjustments for each functional group influence.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, aniline, has a melting point of around 6.2\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the cyano groups (\u2013C\u2261N) in the molecule significantly increases the melting point due to their strong dipole and potential for hydrogen bonding, each cyano group could contribute approximately +40\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the ethylene bridge (\u2013CH2CH2\u2013) adds to the molecular weight and rigidity of the molecule, which could increase the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. \n- The amide group (\u2013CONH\u2013) is capable of strong hydrogen bonding, which can significantly raise the melting point; this could contribute an additional +50\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular structure is complex and rigid, which would further increase the melting point. \n- The predicted increase is the sum of the effects of the functional groups.\n##Prediction: 126.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
