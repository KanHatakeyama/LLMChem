    "Reason": "For the base unit, pyridine, we have a melting point of 115.5\u00b0C. Amino groups typically increase the melting point due to their ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Each amino group in 2,6-diaminopyridine could be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately 3-5\u00b0C owing to these strong intermolecular forces. With two amino groups, the combined effect would be a rise of 6-10\u00b0C.",
