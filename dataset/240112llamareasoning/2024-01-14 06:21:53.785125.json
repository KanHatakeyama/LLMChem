    "Reason": "The core structure of ubenimex can be considered to be benzoic acid, which has a melting point of around 122 degrees Celsius. The modifications to consider include: an isobutyl group, an alpha-amino group, a secondary amine connected to an aromatic ring, an amide group, and a hydroxyl group. The isobutyl group (+30) will raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The alpha-amino group (+10) will contribute to hydrogen-bonding capabilities, raising the melting point, but less so than a primary amino group due to steric hindrance. The secondary amine connected to an aromatic ring (+5) will have a slight increase in molecular weight and some limited hydrogen-bonding potential. The amide group (+40) is a strong site for hydrogen bonding, significantly raising the melting point. Finally, the hydroxyl group (+20) introduces an additional strong site for hydrogen bonding. The effects of these functional groups are considered additive.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the urea group (NC(=O)C(O)) typically increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, which can be estimated to add approximately +80\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the amide group (C(O)N) can also increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, contributing an estimated +50\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the tertiary butyl group (CC(C)CC) adds steric bulk and increases the molecular weight, which can raise the melting point, estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the ether linkage (C-O-C) can have a minor effect on the melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular structure is complex and includes multiple functional groups that can interact with each other, leading to a higher melting point than a simple benzene ring. \n- The molecule has a high degree of symmetry, which can contribute to a higher melting point due to better packing in the solid state, estimated at +10\u00b0C. \n- The molecule has a significant molecular weight, which can increase the melting point due to stronger van der Waals forces, estimated at +15\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the nitrogen atoms in the urea and amide groups can also contribute to the melting point through hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The overall predicted melting point is the sum of these contributions.\n##Prediction: 225.0\n##Reason",
