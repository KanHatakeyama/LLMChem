    "Reason": "The basic unit for 4-phenylquinuclidine can be thought of as quinuclidine, which has a melting point of around -100. However, adding a phenyl group significantly increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the addition of aromaticity, which contributes to stronger intermolecular forces. Phenyl group: approximately +200 due to its large influence on the melting point through aromatic interactions and van der Waals forces. Quinuclidine's structure includes a bridged bicyclic amine, which significantly contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, thus affecting the melting point compared to linear or simpler cyclic compounds. Bridged bicyclic structure: +24 (considering the increase in structural complexity and rigidity).",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound 4-phenylquinuclidine has several functional groups and structural features that influence its melting point. The basic unit, quinuclidine, has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group is an aromatic ring which generally increases the melting point due to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and increased molecular rigidity. This can be estimated to add +20 to the melting point. The quinuclidine structure itself is a rigid and planar molecule, which also contributes to a higher melting point. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can further increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, estimated at +10 each. The overall effect of these groups is additive.\n##Prediction: 140.0\n\n##Prediction",
