    "Reason": "The basic unit for our compound is benzene which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Bromine, being a halogen, is generally much heavier and larger than hydrogen on the benzene ring causing an increase in intermolecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces. Each bromine substituent would significantly raise the melting point due to these increased forces. Let's estimate the increase to be around +40\u00b0C for each bromine atom, noting that the resonance effect of the benzene might also stabilize the compound and contribute slightly to the melting point elevation.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of bromine atoms to the benzene ring significantly increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the polarizability of the bromine atoms, which enhance the intermolecular forces. Each bromine atom can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +40 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 90.0\n\n##Prediction",
