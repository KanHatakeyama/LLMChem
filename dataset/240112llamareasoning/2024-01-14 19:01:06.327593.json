    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 4-pregnene-17a,20b,21-triol-3,11-dione, we must consider the steroid core structure as the base, generally with melting points from 100 to 200. The presence of hydroxyl groups (OH) typically increases a compound's melting point because they form hydrogen bonds, which strengthen the intermolecular forces; three hydroxyl groups could add around 15-25 each. Although the hydrogen bonding capability might be slightly diminished due to steric hindrance within the rigid steroid framework. Ketone groups (C=O) can raise the melting point due to their polar nature and ability to accept hydrogen bonds. Each of the two ketone groups might contribute 10-20 to the melting point. By summing these effects, we can estimate the increase in the melting point from the base range of the steroid structure.",
