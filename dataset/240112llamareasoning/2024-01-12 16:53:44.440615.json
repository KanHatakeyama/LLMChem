    "Reason": "The basic structure for the compound in question is butylamine, which is a four-carbon chain with an amine group. Butylamine has a melting point of approximately -49\u00b0C. However, the target compound is a quaternary ammonium compound with four butyl groups attached to the nitrogen, making it 1-butanaminium, N,N,N-tributyl-, nitrate. Each additional butyl group increases the molecular weight and the van der Waals interactions, which would significantly increase the melting point. Nitrate is an ionic group, which usually significantly increases the melting point due to the strong ionic interactions. Therefore, the large increase in melting point is due to both the added alkyl groups and the ionic nitrate group. Estimating the effect of each butyl group to add about +40\u00b0C to the melting point, and the nitrate group to contribute an additional +60\u00b0C, we get a predicted melting point which will significantly exceed the original butylamine's melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, butane has a melting point of -138.4\u00b0C. \n- Amine group: +20\u00b0C (due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and the increase in molecular weight). \n- Nitrate group: +100\u00b0C (due to the strong intermolecular forces and the ability to form a stable crystal lattice). \n- Each tert-butyl group: +20\u00b0C (due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces). \n- There are three tert-butyl groups, so the total effect is +60\u00b0C. \n- The cumulative effect of these groups is the predicted melting point.\n##Prediction: 108.0\n##Reason",
