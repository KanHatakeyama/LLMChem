    "Reason": "The basic unit to consider here is ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. Adding phenyl groups should increase the melting point because they add significant molecular weight and rigidity to the molecule, and also introduce van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group: +88.15 (an estimate based on the difference in melting point between benzene at 5.5 degrees Celsius and ethylene). Since we have two phenyl groups attached to the same carbon, these effects might not be exactly additive\u2014there could be some steric hindrance that slightly reduces the effect of the second phenyl group. The effect of double bond adjacent to aromatic rings might slightly lower the melting point due to the less spherically symmetric electron clouds compared to a single bond which could reduce crystalline packing efficiency.",
