    "Reason": "The basic unit of the target compound is indole, which is already more rigid and has a higher melting point than benzene due to the presence of the nitrogen atom and the fused ring system, contributing to stronger intermolecular forces. The melting point of indole is known to be around 52\u00b0C. Adding the propanoic acid side chain introduces two significant effects: (1) the carboxylic acid group forms strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, significantly increasing the melting point. (2) The propyl group adds some molecular weight and van der Waals forces, slightly increasing the melting point. However, since the carboxylic acid's effect is far stronger due to hydrogen bonding, it gets a more considerable addition in the estimation. Estimations: indole core with additional rigidity and nitrogen: +40\u00b0C, carboxylic acid group: +45\u00b0C (due to the strong hydrogen bonding), propyl group: +5\u00b0C (minor contribution from increased molecular weight and hydrophobic effect).",
