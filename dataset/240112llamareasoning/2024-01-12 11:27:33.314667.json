    "Reason": "The base molecule for comparison will be uridine, which has a reported melting point range around 165\u00b0C. The isopropylidene group, which is a 5-membered ring connecting the 2' and 3' positions on the sugar moiety of uridine, generally increases steric hindrance and molecular complexity. This is likely to increase the melting point. It's a relatively bulky group and would increase the intermolecular interactions due to larger surface area, leading to higher melting point: +5. However, it's not a large increase because the flexibility of the five-membered ring partially offsets the rigidity that typically contributes to a higher melting point. The Predicted value takes into account mainly the effect of the isopropylidene group as there are no other functional group modifications relative to uridine.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for this molecule can be considered as uridine, which has a melting point of approximately 200 degrees Celsius. The isopropylidene group is a bulky and non-polar substituent that can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. However, the presence of the isopropylidene group also introduces steric hindrance, which can disrupt crystalline packing, potentially lowering the melting point. The effect of the isopropylidene group is estimated to be a decrease of about 20 degrees.\n##Prediction: 180.0\n\n##Prediction",
