    "Reason": "The base unit for stilbene is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Adding a second phenyl group via a double bond to form trans-stilbene structurally locks the compound into a more rigid, planar conformation, enhancing intermolecular interactions such as van der Waals forces and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between the flat molecules in the solid state. Each phenyl group provides a significant increase in melting point due to these interactions. Given that a single phenyl group in benzene contributes to a 5.5 \u00b0C melting point, the additional phenyl group in the trans configuration should add rigidity and greater intermolecular forces. We can estimate this effect to be approximately +60 \u00b0C per phenyl group added to the ethylene base. The contribution from the double bond itself is minor since it does not significantly change the molecular symmetry or packing potential as compared to a single bond in the context of the phenyl groups' impact. Therefore, the prediction would be 5.5 (benzene base) + 120 (two phenyl groups) = 125.5 \u00b0C.",
