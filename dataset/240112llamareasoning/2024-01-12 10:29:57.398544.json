    "Reason": "The target compound contains several functional groups, including two phenyl rings, an oxime group (-C=N-OH), a hydroxyamino group (-NH-OH), and a ketone group within its structure. Starting with propanone as the basic molecule, which has a low melting point, the multiple functional groups in the compound significantly increase its rigidity and its ability to form hydrogen bonds, both of which contribute to an increase in the melting point. Each phenyl ring adds aromaticity and further possibilities for intermolecular interactions, such as pi-pi stacking, which I estimate to increase the melting point by about +70 degrees Celsius per ring. The oxime group with its ability to hydrogen bond and dimerize can be estimated to increase the melting point by +50 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyamino group also introduces additional hydrogen bonding, which can be estimated to add another +50 degrees Celsius. Although the propanone (acetone) base has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius, the presence of these functional groups substantially alters the melting point of the compound.",
