    "Reason": "For 2,2'-biphenol, consider the following effects. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of hydroxyl (-OH) groups significantly increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding. Since there are two -OH groups, we can consider their combined effect. We can estimate the effect of each -OH group to be approximately +50\u00b0C per -OH group due to increased hydrogen bonding and polarity. The biphenyl structure can further increase the melting point compared to a single benzene ring due to the larger size, which enhances van der Waals forces, and possible \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the rings could add roughly +10\u00b0C. However, this is partially offset by the free rotation around the single bond connecting the biphenyls, which may decrease the regularity of the crystal packing, reducing the melting point. We might estimate the offset to be about -5\u00b0C for this decreased regularity.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- Two phenol groups: Each phenol group can form hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. The contribution of each phenol group might be estimated at +40 degrees.\n- The presence of two phenol groups in a molecule increases the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can lead to a higher melting point.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
