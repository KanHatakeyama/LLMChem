    "Reason": "The base structure for the compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of an amino group typically increases the melting point due to the introduction of hydrogen bonding, which can add about 20\u00b0C to the melting point. The hydroxyl group, which is capable of hydrogen bonding as well, may further increase the melting point by approximately another 40\u00b0C. The piperazine ring is a relatively large substituent that also creates additional steric hindrance and contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, thereby potentially raising the melting point. The piperazine substitution might contribute an increase of approximately 60\u00b0C. Since the molecule becomes more polar and has a greater capacity for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, the combined effects of the amino, hydroxyl groups, and the piperazine ring lead to a significant increase in the melting point compared to benzene.",
