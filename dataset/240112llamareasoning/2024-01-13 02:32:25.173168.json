    "Reason": "The target compound, 4-nitrophenyl bromoacetate, can be broken down into the following functional groups and structural elements affecting its melting point: the phenyl ring, the nitro group, the ester linkage, and the bromo substituent. \n- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Phenyl ring: The presence of a phenyl ring generally increases melting point due to the stabilizing effect of pi-stacking and its planar structure, facilitating better packing in the solid state (+20\u00b0C). \n- Nitro group: Nitro groups can significantly raise the melting point as they can involve the molecule in strong intermolecular attractions like hydrogen bonding and dipoles interactions (+50\u00b0C). \n- Ester linkage (bromoacetate part): Esters typically have polar carbonyl and alkoxy groups which might lead to additional dipole-dipole interactions and a modest increase in melting point (+10\u00b0C). \n- Bromo substituent: The bromine atom adds significant molecular weight and size, potentially increasing the melting point due to stronger London dispersion forces; however, too large substituents might hinder close packing, slightly lowering the expected increase (+5\u00b0C, considering both effects). \nPredicting the effect of each functional group separately, the cumulative expected adjustment to the benzene base melting point is +85\u00b0C, bringing us to a predicted melting point of 90.5\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.\n- Nitro group: Est. +80\u00b0C (strong electron-withdrawing group, significant dipole moment, and potential for intermolecular interactions)\n- Bromoacetate group: Est. +50\u00b0C (polar carbonyl group and bromine contribute to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions)\n- Acetate group: Est. +20\u00b0C (polar carbonyl group contributes to dipole-dipole interactions)\n\nHowever, the actual melting point is 105.0\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the sum of the estimated contributions of each functional group. This suggests that the molecule's overall structure and packing are more stable than expected, leading to a higher melting point.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n\n\n#Problem",
