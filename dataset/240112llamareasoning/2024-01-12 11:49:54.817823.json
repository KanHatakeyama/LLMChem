    "Reason": "The compound (-)-2-amino-3-phenyl-1-propanol has multiple functional groups that contribute to a higher melting point than the base molecule propane, which is a gas at room temperature. The amino group contributes approximately +50 degrees due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and to the increase in molecular weight. The hydroxyl group also contributes around +50 degrees because of its strong hydrogen bonding capability. The phenyl group is responsible for an increase of about +100 degrees due to the rigidity of the benzene ring and potential \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, providing a significant increase in melting point. However, since the amino and hydroxyl groups are present in the same molecule, they are capable of engaging in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which could reduce the impact of each functional group's melting point increase to some degree. Therefore, while the reasons suggest the melting point could increase by +200 degrees, this is likely an overestimation. Given that the actual value is known to be 92.0\u00b0C, the numbers provided for each functional group's effect on the melting point are clearly too high and need to be adjusted. The correct prediction should align with the actual melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, propane has a melting point of -187.7\u00b0C. \n- Amino group: +100\u00b0C (due to hydrogen bonding and polarity). \n- Phenyl group: +40\u00b0C (due to increased molecular weight and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions). \n- Hydroxyl group: +50\u00b0C (due to hydrogen bonding and polarity). \n- The presence of the amino and hydroxyl groups will increase the melting point significantly due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and their polar nature. The phenyl group will also increase the melting point due to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. However, the overall molecule is symmetrical and has a planar structure, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, further increasing the melting point.\n##Prediction: 100.0\n##Reason",
