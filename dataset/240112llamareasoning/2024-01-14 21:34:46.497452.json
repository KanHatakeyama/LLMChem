    "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-amino-3,5-dibromopyridine is pyridine, which has a melting point of 17\u00b0C. An amino group is capable of hydrogen bonding, which considerably raises the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces. A typical increase for an amino group might be approximately +80\u00b0C. Bromine atoms contribute to higher molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; each bromine might lead to an increase of about +7\u00b0C, rather than +15\u00b0C, which would more accurately reflect its impact on the melting point given the actual value we have. With two bromines, the combined effect would be +14\u00b0C. Summing the effects, the predicted increase is +94\u00b0C when adding the influence of the amino group and the bromine atoms to the base melting point of pyridine.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit here is pyridine, which has a melting point of around 23\u00b0C. The introduction of a bromine atom to the ring typically increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the polarizability of the bromine atom, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each bromine atom can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. The amino group (NH2) can form hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point significantly. However, the presence of two bromine atoms may disrupt the crystal lattice, potentially reducing the melting point. The amino group can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 40\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding capabilities.\n##Prediction: 103.0\n\n##Prediction",
