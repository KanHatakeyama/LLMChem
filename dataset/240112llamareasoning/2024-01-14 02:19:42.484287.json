    "Reason": "The compound (1E)-N-hydroxy-1-(naphthalen-2-yl)-2-phenylethanimine contains several functional groups that affect its melting point, with naphthalene as the basic unit. The naphthalene base has a melting point of 80. The individual contributions of functional groups and structural features to the melting point would be: 1. Phenyl group - generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-pi interactions (+25). 2. N-hydroxyimine group - significantly elevates the melting point via hydrogen bonding and contribution to molecular rigidity (+20). 3. Ethanimine side chain - adds to the molecular weight and rigidity, with a smaller impact on the melting point (+4). All these effects combined give an estimated influence on the melting point when considering each group individually and their interactions.",
