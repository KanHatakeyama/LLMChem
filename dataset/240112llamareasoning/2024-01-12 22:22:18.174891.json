    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is propane, which has a melting point of -187.7 degrees Celsius. Adding fluorine atoms generally increases the melting point due to increased polarity and the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond, which leads to stronger intermolecular forces. Each fluorine is estimated to raise the melting point. For the first fluorine substituent on propane, we might estimate an increase of approximately +42 degrees due to enhanced dipole moments and van der Waals forces. Given the symmetry of 2,2-difluoro- configuration, the second fluorine would likely have a similar effect as the first. Taking this into account, the second fluorine's effect is estimated to be an additional +42 degrees. Thus, the total estimated increase is +84 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, propane has a melting point of -187.7\u00b0C. \n- Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and can form strong dipole-dipole interactions, which typically increase the melting point. Each fluorine on a carbon chain can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two fluorine atoms on the same carbon (2,2-difluoro) will increase the melting point more than a single fluorine due to the increased molecular weight and the additional dipole-dipole interactions. This effect can be estimated to be around 40\u00b0C for each fluorine. \n- The overall effect of the two fluorine atoms on the melting point is therefore 80\u00b0C (2 * 40\u00b0C).\n##Prediction: -107.0\n##Reason",
