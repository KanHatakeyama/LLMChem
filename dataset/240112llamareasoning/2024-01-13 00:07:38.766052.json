    "Reason": "The compound 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone has several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic benzophenone structure, like in diphenylmethanone, has a melting point of about 48\u00b0C. Each functional group will alter this baseline value. An amino group (-NH2) usually increases the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can add around +20 to +50\u00b0C. Furthermore, a nitro group (-NO2), due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature, also increases the melting point significantly, potentially adding another +30 to +70\u00b0C because it helps stabilize the crystal lattice of the solid compound. A ketone group (C=O) is already accounted for in the base structure of benzophenone. Considering these effects, we can predict the melting point to be higher than the base value. ",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.\n- The presence of a nitro group significantly increases the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature and the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, estimated at around 80 degrees.\n- The amino group can form hydrogen bonds, adding another 40 degrees.\n- The ketone group contributes to the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at 20 degrees.\n- The overall molecular structure is rigid and planar, which can increase the melting point due to better packing in the solid state, estimated at 10 degrees.\n##Prediction: 155.0\n\n\n#Problem",
