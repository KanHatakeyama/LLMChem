    "Reason": "The target compound (1Z)-1,2-diphenylethanone O-(phenylcarbonyl)oxime consists of several functional groups: three phenyl rings, a ketone, and an oxime. Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C as a reference, we analyze the contribution of each group. Each additional phenyl group would contribute to an increase due to enhanced van der Waals interactions and a larger molecular surface area. This increase can be estimated at roughly +20\u00b0C per phenyl group. The ketone group, with its polar nature and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, can be expected to contribute an additional +15\u00b0C. The oxime group, due to its capacity for hydrogen bonding, might increase the melting point by an additional +30\u00b0C. All these effects, however, might be reduced due to potentially unfavorable steric hindrance and imperfect molecular packing.",
