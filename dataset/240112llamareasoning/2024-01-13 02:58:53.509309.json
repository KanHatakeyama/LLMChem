    "Reason": "For indopan, the basic unit we can consider is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5 \u00b0C. Indopan has additional functional groups and structural modifications: an amine group (C(NH2)-), a naphthyridine structure (fused benzene and pyridine rings), and an ethyl side chain. The amine group typically raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding potential, which we can estimate at +50 \u00b0C. The naphthyridine structure introduces nitrogen atoms into the ring, which increases the melting point due to additional ring stability and potential for hydrogen bonding; let's estimate this effect to be +40 \u00b0C. The ethyl side chain adds some steric bulk, but since it does not contribute significantly to intermolecular forces, its effect is smaller; let's estimate +5 \u00b0C. All these effects are additive.",
