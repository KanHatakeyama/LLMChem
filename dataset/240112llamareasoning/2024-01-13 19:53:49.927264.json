    "Reason": "Lupeol consists of a pentacyclic triterpene structure, which forms a rigid and complex framework increasing the melting point due to strong Van der Waals forces and limited rotational freedom. Large fused ring systems significantly increase the melting point. Each ring can contribute approximately +20\u00b0C due to its rigidity and intermolecular forces. The molecule has five fused rings, so this could add about +100\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group contributes to the melting point through hydrogen bonding, which might add approximately +5\u00b0C. Methyl groups attached to the rings increase the molecular weight and Van der Waals interactions but have a smaller effect in such a large molecule, estimated at +2\u00b0C per methyl group. Lupeol has eight methyl groups, adding up to roughly +16\u00b0C. Saturation levels can affect the packing and melting point, but due to the already rigid structure of lupeol, the effect may be slight and is considered negligible in this estimation.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, steroids, typically have a high melting point due to their rigid, planar structure and the ability to pack efficiently in the solid state. For example, cholesterol has a melting point of 149 \u00b0C.\n- The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) can form hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point. This effect can be estimated at +20 degrees Celsius.\n- The presence of a ketone group (-C=O) can also increase the melting point due to its polar nature and the ability to form dipole-dipole interactions. This effect can be estimated at +10 degrees Celsius.\n- The presence of a double bond (C=C) in the molecule can slightly increase the melting point due to the rigidity it introduces to the structure, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius.\n- The molecule also contains a long carbon chain, which can increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. This effect can be estimated at +15 degrees Celsius.\n- The overall molecular weight and size of the molecule will also contribute to the melting point, which can be estimated at +10 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 199.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
