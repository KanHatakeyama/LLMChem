    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of -42\u00b0C. The introduction of bromine (a heavy halogen) typically raises the melting point significantly, by approximately +110 due to increased molecular weight and the ability to participate in intermolecular interactions such as halogen bonding. The chlorine atom would also increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and size, contributing an additional +40. The second pyridine ring adds to the molecular complexity and rigidity, which usually increases melting point due to increased molecular interactions; this is estimated to add another +53.",
