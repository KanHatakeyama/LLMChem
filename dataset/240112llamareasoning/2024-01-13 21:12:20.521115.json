    "Reason": "The basic unit in this case is atomic sulfur, which typically exists as S8 rings in its solid form. Elemental sulfur's crystals are held together by relatively weak van der Waals forces between S8 molecules which determines its melting point. The lack of additional functional groups and the simple molecular structure suggests the melting point is mainly influenced by the molecular interactions between these S8 rings.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for sulfur is hydrogen, which has a melting point of 20 degrees Celsius. Sulfur has a much higher atomic mass and a larger molecular size than hydrogen, which would significantly increase the melting point. However, since sulfur is a non-metal and does not form strong intermolecular bonds like hydrogen, the increase in melting point is not as high as it would be for a metal like hydrogen.\n##Prediction: 119.0\n##Reason",
