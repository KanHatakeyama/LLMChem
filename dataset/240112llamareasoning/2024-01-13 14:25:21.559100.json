    "Reason": "The basic pyridine ring, which has a melting point of around 20 degrees Celsius, forms the foundational structure of pyridine-4-carboxaldoxime. The oxime group (-C=NOH) attached to the ring is known for its ability to engage in strong hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which could contribute to an increase in the melting point by about +80 degrees Celsius. The aldehyde group (-CHO), though not as influential as the oxime in terms of hydrogen bonding, can still increase the melting point through additional dipole-dipole interactions, estimated to raise the melting point by about +15 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the nitrogen in the pyridine ring enhances molecular stability and slightly raises the melting point through its lone pair, which can engage in hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, potentially adding another +10 degrees Celsius. Combining these adjustments provides the total estimated increase to the melting point of the compound.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, pyridine has a melting point of around 20\u00b0C. \n- The carboxaldoxime group (C=NOH) is a polar functional group that can form hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point significantly. This group can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately 100\u00b0C due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. \n- The presence of the aldoxime group also introduces a degree of rigidity to the molecule, which can further increase the melting point. This effect can be estimated to add another 20\u00b0C to the melting point. \n- The overall effect of these functional groups on the melting point is additive.\n##Prediction: 140.0\n##Reason",
