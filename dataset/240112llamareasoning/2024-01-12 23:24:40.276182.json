    "Reason": "The base structure to consider for probarbital can be pyrimidine, which has a melting point around 20-22 degrees Celsius. Probarbital is a barbituric acid derivative. Introduction of the two carbonyl groups adjacent to the nitrogens in barbituric acid core would significantly increase melting point because these groups are capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds, and add conjugation to the system. For each carbonyl group, we can estimate this effect to be about +100 degrees due to the added rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. Additionally, two ethyl groups are present. Alkyl groups typically increase the molecular weight and thus, generally raise the melting point. The effect of an ethyl group can be around +20 degrees for each group due to increased van der Waals forces. Isopropyl substitution has a slightly larger alkyl group effect, and could be estimated at around +25 degrees due to branched structure which may impede packing efficiency slightly less than straight-chain alkyls. The sum of these modifications can be used to estimate the melting point of probarbital.",
