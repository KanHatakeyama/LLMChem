    "Reason": "Starting with cyclohexanone as a reference, with a melting point of 44\u00b0C, we estimate the effect of the bicyclic structure. Due to increased rigidity and intermolecular interactions, the bicyclic nature of camphor is likely to contribute significantly to its melting point. We can roughly attribute an additional +100\u00b0C for this structural feature based on typical trends observed in bicyclic compounds compared to their monocyclic counterparts. Each methyl group attached to the ring increases the molecular weight and enhances van der Waals forces, which typically would raise melting points. However, they also introduce steric hindrance, which could reduce packing efficiency. A conservative estimate for each methyl group\u2019s contribution could be around +10\u00b0C. Given that camphor has three such groups, their combined estimated effect would be +30\u00b0C. Additionally, the carbonyl group contributes to the intermolecular interactions through possible dipole-dipole forces, which typically increase the melting point. We can estimate the carbonyl group's contribution to be around +10\u00b0C. Combining these estimates gives us the predicted melting point for camphor.",
