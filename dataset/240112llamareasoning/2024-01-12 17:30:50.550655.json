    "Reason": "Starting from the base compound of ethane, which has a melting point of approximately -172 degrees Celsius, we consider the effects of replacing hydrogen atoms with cyano groups. Each cyano group brings highly electronegative elements (nitrogen and carbon in a triple bond), promoting stronger intermolecular forces compared to ethane. These forces can be attributed mainly to dipole-dipole interactions, given that cyano groups have a strong permanent dipole moment. Despite the increase in intermolecular forces, the linear and non-bulky nature of the cyano groups does not lead to a significant increase in the melting point, as these structures tend to pack less effectively in the solid state, which could mitigate the impact of stronger dipole-dipole interactions. Thus, the effect of introducing each cyano group is estimated to increase the melting point by roughly +70 degrees Celsius compared to ethane.",
