    "Reason": "The base structure for our prediction will be the bicyclic system of camphor, which has a melting point of around 175\u00b0C. Adding substituents to this system affects the melting point: The sultam group increases polarity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C. However, the camphorsultam is a chiral compound with potential for internal strain due to its rigid structure; this conformational constraint can slightly lower the melting point, which we can estimate as a 5\u00b0C decrease. Additionally, the methyl group can have a slight increasing effect on the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at about +3\u00b0C. Adding these effects together gives us the predicted melting point for (1S,2R)-10,2-camphorsultam.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison could be camphor, which has a melting point of 80.5 degrees Celsius. The compound in question has several functional groups that will affect its melting point: (1) The presence of a sultam group (CS(=O)2) is expected to significantly increase the melting point due to the rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding it introduces. This could be estimated to add around +100 degrees Celsius. (2) The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (sultam) also increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the rigidity it introduces. This could be estimated to add around +50 degrees Celsius. (3) The presence of a methyl group (CH3) attached to the camphor ring might slightly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; this could be estimated to add around +5 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 195.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
