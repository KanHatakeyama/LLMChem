    "Reason": "Target compound: (2E)-1-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-2-[(2-ethenylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methylidene]hydrazine. Basic unit to compare is a benzene ring, which has a melting point of approximately 5.5 degrees Celsius. Adding substituents to the benzene ring can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and enhanced intermolecular interactions. 1. Nitro groups: Two nitro groups are present, each can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. They are strong electron-withdrawing groups which stabilize the molecular structure. Estimated increase of +50 degrees Celsius per nitro group. 2. Hydrazine linkage: Provides rigidity and the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. Estimated increase of +20 degrees Celsius. 3. Vinyl group and cyclohexene: The additional unsaturation and a ring structure contribute to planarity and rigidity, leading to better packing of molecules. Estimated increase of +10 degrees Celsius for the vinyl group and +15 degrees Celsius for the cyclohexene. Combining the effects, the predicted increase in melting point is +50 (nitro) * 2 + 20 (hydrazine linkage) + 10 (vinyl group) + 15 (cyclohexene) = 145 degrees Celsius over the base value for benzene. Adding this to the baseline melting point of benzene gives an estimated melting point for the target compound.",
