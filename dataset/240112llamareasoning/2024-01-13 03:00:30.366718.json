    "Reason": "The compound 2,6-Dichlorobenzonitrile includes a benzene ring, two chlorine atoms and a nitrile group. The basic unit of benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of electronegative chlorine atoms contributes to a significant increase in melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interaction and potential crystal lattice formation. Each chlorine might contribute an increase of about 40\u00b0C. The nitrile group also increases the polarity and the potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which could also raise the melting point significantly, contributing an estimated additional 50\u00b0C. Combining these effects should result in an overall increase in melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. \n- Chlorine atoms: Each chlorine atom is electronegative and can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine might contribute an increase of about 20-30 \u00b0C. \n- Nitrile group (C#N): This group is polar and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. The nitrile group might contribute an additional 30-40 \u00b0C. \nCombining these effects, we can predict the melting point of 2,6-Dichlorobenzonitrile.\n##Prediction: 145.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
