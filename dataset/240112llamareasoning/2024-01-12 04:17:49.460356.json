    "Reason": "Alclofenac features a benzene ring as its core structure, which has a baseline melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Addition of functional groups will modify this base value. - The chlorine atom, due to its high electronegativity and the polarizability of the resulting C-Cl bond, as well as the additional van der Waals forces it facilitates, typically increases the melting point. This addition may contribute an estimated +40\u00b0C. - The vinyl group (ethenyl, C=C) is a relatively small group and not highly electron-withdrawing, so its effect on the melting point would likely be relatively modest, perhaps around +5\u00b0C. - The ester group (COO) is a polar functional group capable of engaging in dipole-dipole interactions, and might raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to these intermolecular forces. - The acetyl group (CC(=O)O) is planar and may enable better packing and stacking in the solid state, potentially adding another +20\u00b0C to the melting point. Adding these values to the baseline gives an estimated total increase.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The compound Alclofenac has several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic unit we can consider is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a chlorine atom (Cl) generally increases the melting point due to its electronegativity and the resulting dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The ketone (C=O) group can form hydrogen bonds and also contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, estimated at +30\u00b0C. The presence of two methyl groups (CH3) adds to the molecular weight and steric hindrance, estimated at +5\u00b0C each, totaling +10\u00b0C. The bicyclic structure adds to the rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The overall prediction is an accumulation of these increments.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
