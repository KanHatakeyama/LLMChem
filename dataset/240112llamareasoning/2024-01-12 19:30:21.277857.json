    "Reason": "The compound in question, 2-Hydroxy-5-{(E)-[4-(pyridin-2-ylsulfamoyl)phenyl]diazenyl}benzoic acid, contains several functional groups that influence its melting point. First, let's consider the basic phenyl ring. A simple benzene ring has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. We then have to account for the following functional groups: \n- Carboxylic acid group (COOH): adds significant rigidity and hydrogen bonding ability, which drastically increases the melting point, around +100\u00b0C to +150\u00b0C. \n- Hydroxy group (OH) attached to the benzene ring: introduces additional hydrogen bonding, typically adding around +40\u00b0C to +80\u00b0C. \n- Azobenzene moiety (N=N with two phenyls): contributes to increased rigidity and planarity, possibly increasing the melting point by around +50\u00b0C to +70\u00b0C. \n- Sulfonamide group (SO2NH2) attached to the pyridine: greatly enhances the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipolar interactions, possibly contributing around +80\u00b0C to +120\u00b0C. \n- Pyridinyl group: can add additional stability and rigidity but to a lesser extent than other groups; we might estimate an increase of around +10\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C. \nWhen summing these contributions, we use the midpoints of the estimated ranges to yield a predicted melting point.",
