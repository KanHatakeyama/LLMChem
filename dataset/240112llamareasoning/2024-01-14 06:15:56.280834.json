    "Reason": "n,n'-diethyl-oxalamide contains several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic unit, oxamide (derived from oxalic acid and ammonia), would typically have a moderate to high melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding capabilities and the rigidity of the dione structure. The oxamide base itself is estimated to have a melting point around 200-230\u00b0C. Each ethyl group attached to the nitrogen is likely to decrease the melting point due to the addition of aliphatic bulk reducing the overall hydrogen bonding capability relative to the oxamide base. Based on similar compounds, each ethyl group could reduce the melting point by approximately 20-30\u00b0C. With two ethyl groups, this would imply a cumulative reduction of 40-60\u00b0C from the base structure's melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethane has a melting point of -183\u00b0C. \n- The oxalamide structure introduces the potential for hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. This could be estimated at +150\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two ethyl groups will increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each ethyl group might contribute around +5\u00b0C. \n- The amide linkage (C=O) is capable of hydrogen bonding, which further increases the melting point. This could be estimated at +20\u00b0C. \n- The overall structure is rigid and planar, which can lead to better packing in the solid state, potentially increasing the melting point. This could be estimated at +10\u00b0C. \n##Prediction: 165.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
