    "Reason": "The compound ethanol, 2-(butylamino)- is made up of an ethanol group (OH), a butylamine (butyl with NH2), and a connecting ethylene (C2H4) segment. Starting with ethanol (C2H5OH), which has a melting point around -114\u00b0C, we consider the following functional group effects: The butyl group is a larger alkyl chain which generally increases melting point due to increased London dispersion forces; this could add approximately +20\u00b0C. The amino group (NH2) can engage in hydrogen bonding, substantially increasing melting point; this could add another +50\u00b0C, possibly more given that intermolecular hydrogen bonding is significant. However, the connecting ethylene segment does not significantly affect the melting point. Considering these adjustments to the base -114\u00b0C of ethanol: +20\u00b0C for the butyl group and +50\u00b0C for the amino group. Hence, the prediction is -114 + 20 + 50 = -44\u00b0C. Since the actual value is -2\u00b0C, we need to adjust our estimation of the hydrogen bonding capacity of the amino group, which appears to have a larger effect than initially predicted.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethanol has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. \n- The butylamino group is a large alkyl group that can increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. The effect of a butyl group on the melting point of an alcohol is typically around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \n- The amino group can form hydrogen bonds, which would increase the melting point. The effect of an amino group on the melting point of an alcohol is typically around +5 to +10\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the amino group also introduces the possibility of hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group, which could further increase the melting point.\n##Prediction: -10.0\n##Reason",
