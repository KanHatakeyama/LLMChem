    "Reason": "The target compound is (2E)-But-2-ene. The basic unit for comparison could be ethene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. Adding two more carbons to the chain in but-2-ene raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and London dispersion forces. The presence of the double bond in (2E)-But-2-ene introduces geometric (cis/trans) isomerism, but in this case, the trans isomer would have a slightly higher melting point compared to its cis isomer due to the symmetry and better packing in the solid state. Each -CH2- group in an alkene can roughly be estimated to raise the melting point by about 20 degrees Celsius as a starting point of estimation. However, given that these are very rough estimates and the molecule is small, the increase might be less pronounced. The cumulative effect of two -CH2- groups should lead to an increase, but the exact value will also depend on the specific interactions and molecular symmetry of the trans isomer.",
