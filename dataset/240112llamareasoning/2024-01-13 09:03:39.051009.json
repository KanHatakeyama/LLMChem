    "Reason": "The compound 4-bromo-3-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride has various functional groups affecting its melting point. Starting with the base structure of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, each additional group contributes to the net shift in melting point. The methyl group (CH3) attached to the benzene ring generally raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and surface area, enhancing van der Waals forces; this increase is estimated to be around +5\u00b0C. The bromo substitution is a heavy halogen that significantly increases the melting point because of its increased molecular weight and stronger van der Waals interactions, justifying an increase of approximately +20\u00b0C. Moreover, the sulfonyl chloride functional group (-SO2Cl) is a polar and bulky substituent that can form strong intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, leading to a considerable rise in melting point; an increase of about +30\u00b0C might be expected from this group. However, the added bulk and differing polarities might hinder perfect crystal lattice packing, which could result in some compensation for these increases. Considering all these factors, the overall estimated increase could be slightly lower than the sum of individual increases.",
