    "Reason": "The basic unit of ethyl thiocyanate is the thiocyanate anion (-SCN), which in its ionic form can have a high melting point due to ion-ion interactions. However, ethyl thiocyanate is a covalent compound, and this difference significantly reduces the melting point. The presence of the ethyl group (-CH2-CH3), which is non-polar, introduces some alkyl bulk and reduces polarity, thereby lowering the melting point. Additionally, the C-N triple bond and the S-C bond in the SCN group are strong and rigid but do not particularly elevate the melting point due to the overall non-polarity and size of the molecule. Therefore, the prediction must account for a significant decrease from a hypothetical high melting point of an ionic thiocyanate. A reasonable estimate for the decrease due to the ethyl group in organic molecules could be in the range of -300\u00b0C to -400\u00b0C. Adding the polar but small SCN moiety could adjust this figure slightly upwards. Let's quantify the impacts as follows: Thiocyanate-like group base unit: assume -50\u00b0C for its polar but small contribution, Ethyl group: roughly -375\u00b0C for the decrease due to non-polar alkyl bulk.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, ethane, has a melting point of -182.5\u00b0C. The thiocyanate group (N#CS) is a polar functional group that can form strong intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. The thiocyanate group is also larger and more rigid than a hydrogen atom, which adds to the molecular weight and the overall molecular structure, further increasing the melting point. The presence of the sulfur atom also adds to the molecular weight and the polarizability of the molecule, which can further enhance the melting point.\n##Prediction: -105.0\n\n##Prediction",
