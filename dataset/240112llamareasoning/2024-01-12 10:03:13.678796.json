    "Reason": "The basic unit for 3-nitroaniline is aniline, which has a melting point of around -6\u00b0C. The nitro group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, tends to increase the melting point of aromatic compounds due to the resonance stabilization and the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which could raise the melting point by up to 80-100\u00b0C. Additionally, the presence of the amino group (NH2) as a substituent on the benzene ring would typically increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding between molecules, potentially adding another 20\u00b0C to the melting point of the base structure.",

The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which increases the melting point due to the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. This effect can be estimated to add approximately +80 degrees Celsius.\n\n##Prediction",
