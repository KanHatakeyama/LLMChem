    "Reason": "The basic unit in cyclohexane is a saturated carbon ring structure without any double bonds or functional groups. Alkanes have relatively low melting points because of their non-polar nature and weak van der Waals forces. The six-membered ring structure of cyclohexane tends to give it a slightly higher melting point compared to its open-chain analogue, hexane, due to better packing in the solid state. However, since there are no additional functional groups present to significantly enhance intermolecular forces, we should not expect a large deviation from the general range of melting points for similar sized alkanes.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for cyclohexane is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The effect of a methyl group on the melting point of cyclohexane can be estimated to be around +20 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 26.0\n##Reason",
