    "Reason": "The basic unit here is propane, which has a melting point of around -188 degrees Celsius. Each phenyl group is a large, aromatic, and planar which tends to increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces and potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the rings, so we can estimate an increase. Each phenyl might add approximately +100 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom is also large and heavy, which can further increase the melting point. Bromine could add approximately +30 degrees Celsius due to its atomic mass and the polarizability of the C-Br bond. However, the sheer bulkiness of the substituents might lead to a less efficient packing, which may prevent a significant boost in the melting point. Overall, we must consider that the substituents may not simply have an additive effect, but could cause steric hindrance that affects the crystal lattice stability.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of a bromine atom to the benzene ring typically increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the introduction of a polarizable electron, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces. The presence of two phenyl groups also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the pi-pi stacking interactions between the aromatic rings. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius to the melting point. The bromine atom adds +20 due to its larger size and polarizability.\n##Prediction: 50.0\n\n##Prediction",
