    "Reason": "The basic unit for N-phenylmaleimide is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Adding a maleimide group, which has a high degree of conjugation and can participate in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding due to its imide hydrogen, significantly increases the melting point. A basic maleimide has a melting point around 93-94\u00b0C. The N-phenyl group adds further aromaticity and has a larger molecular weight than a hydrogen atom, leading to an increase in van der Waals interactions and stability of the crystal lattice, but it also reduces symmetry slightly compared to the symmetrical maleimide, potentially decreasing the melting point. The combined effect of these groups could be an increase of roughly 80\u00b0C from the basic benzene unit due to the maleimide and an additional increase of about 3-5\u00b0C for the phenyl addition, but also considering a minor symmetrical reduction of about -5\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The base structure for N-phenylmaleimide is the maleimide group, which has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C due to its small size and the lack of strong intermolecular forces. The phenyl group attached to the maleimide increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi stacking interactions, which could add approximately +30\u00b0C. The N-phenylmaleimide group also introduces a nitrogen atom which can participate in hydrogen bonding, further increasing the melting point. This could add another +20\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 106.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
