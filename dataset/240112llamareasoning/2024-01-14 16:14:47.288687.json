    "Reason": "Starting with ethane as a base, which has a melting point of roughly -182\u00b0C, the addition of functional groups to form acetamide results in substantial changes in the melting point. The methyl group (CH3-) contributes a small increase in melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group (C=O) introduces a significant increase in melting point due to strong polar interactions and dipole-dipole forces, estimated at approximately +45\u00b0C. The amide group (-CONH2) causes the greatest increase in melting point due to its ability to participate in extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is a very strong force. The increase from the amide group is estimated at around +207\u00b0C. By summing these contributions, the predicted melting point for acetamide would align closely with the actual value.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for acetamide is acetic acid, which has a melting point of -20.2 degrees Celsius. The amide group (C=O) is capable of forming hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. The amide group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +100 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 80.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
