    "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit, methanol (CH3OH), which has a melting point of -97.6 degrees Celsius, we can add the effects of the functional groups present in methyl carbamate to predict the melting point. Carbonyl group (C=O) results in a significant increase due to addition of a polar, planar group that can engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, we estimate this to contribute +100 degrees Celsius. The amine group (NH2) attached to the carbonyl further increases the melting point due to its capability for hydrogen bonding, adding another +50 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the expected shift in the melting point from methanol to methyl carbamate is estimated to be the sum of these contributions.",
