    "Reason": "The target compound, benzene, 1-(chloromethyl)-4-nitro-, contains three significant functional groups on a basic benzene ring: a chloromethyl group, a nitro group, and the aromatic system itself. For the basic benzene, the melting point is 5.5 \u00b0C. The chloromethyl group is expected to increase the melting point due to its polar nature and the presence of a chlorine atom, which introduces dipole-dipole interactions; this can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The nitro group, which is highly electronegative and introduces both inductive and mesomeric effects, can further raise the melting point due to the potential for strong dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding with other molecules; this may account for an additional +40\u00b0C increase. Overall, the presence of these groups should substantially increase the melting point from the base value for benzene.",
