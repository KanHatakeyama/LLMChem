    "Reason": "The target compound has several functional groups that influence its melting point. The base structure is phenylpropionic acid, and we will use benzoic acid (a compound with a similar structure, with a melting point around 122 \u00b0C) as our starting reference point. Each functional group contributes to the melting point as follows:\n- Fluorination on the phenyl ring: +20 (due to the strong electronegativity and dipole-dipole interaction of the fluorine atom)\n- The boc-amino group: +2 (due to the steric hindrance and substitution on the nitrogen, which slightly increases the melting point)\n- The propionic acid moiety usually doesn't have a significant deviation from the benzoic acid reference, but the attachment to the aminoboc group could result in a slight decrease. So, let's assume a -1 change.\nAdding this together to the reference benzoic acid melting point of 122 \u00b0C, we get an estimated melting point for the target compound.",
