    "Reason": "Methane's boiling point is governed by its small molecular size and weak van der Waals forces. Being the simplest alkane with a single carbon atom, it does not possess any functional groups that would significantly alter its boiling point from what would be expected based on its molecular weight and nonpolar nature.",
