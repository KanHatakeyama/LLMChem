    "Reason": "The basic structural units to consider for methadone's melting point are a ketone, two benzene rings, a tertiary amine with methyl groups, and an aliphatic carbon chain. The ketone generally increases the melting point due to its polar nature and hydrogen-bond acceptor capabilities. Each benzene ring will also raise the melting point because of the stable, rigid structure and potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. A tertiary amine with methyl groups may slightly raise the melting point; while N-methyl groups can contribute to an increase due to steric hindrance and electron-donating effects, the presence of the nitrogen can lower the melting point through dipole interactions that are less strong than hydrogen bonds. The additional aliphatic chain potentially adds to the van der Waals forces between molecules, raising the melting point. Here is a hypothetical breakdown for estimation purposes; however, please note that these values are not from a standardized dataset and are for illustrative purposes only: cyclohexane (basic aliphatic ring): 6.5 \u00b0C, increase for benzene ring substituent: +40 \u00b0C per ring, ketone group: +20 \u00b0C, tertiary amine: -5 \u00b0C (potentially higher, but we'll consider a balance between the amine and N-methyl groups), aliphatic carbon chain: +5 \u00b0C. Summing these adjustments to the base value for a simple aliphatic ring we get an estimated melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.\n- The presence of the methoxy group (OCH3) typically increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated to add around +20\u00b0C.\n- The presence of the methyl group (CH3) attached to the benzene ring can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated to add around +5\u00b0C.\n- The presence of the morphine ring (C1CCC1) contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point, estimated to add around +10\u00b0C.\n- The presence of the pyrrolidine ring (C2CCC1) contributes to the rigidity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated to add around +15\u00b0C.\n- The presence of the N-methyl group (C) attached to the morphine ring can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated to add around +5\u00b0C.\n- The presence of the methadone's long carbon chain (C1CCCC1) can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated to add around +10\u00b0C.\n- The overall molecular complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups contribute to a higher melting point.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n##Reason",
