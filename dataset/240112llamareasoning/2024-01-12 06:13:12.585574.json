    "Reason": "The basic reference molecule is hexane, which has a melting point of -95.3 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene (CH2) group in an alkane tends to increase the melting point by about 20 degrees Celsius due to enhanced van der Waals forces. Decanenitrile has four more CH2 groups than hexane, suggesting an increase of around 80 degrees Celsius. The cyano group (C\u2261N) introduces polarity and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions, likely further increasing the melting point. However, because the actual value of the melting point for decanenitrile is -17.9 degrees Celsius, we need to adjust the estimate for the cyano group. The impact of the cyano group appears to be a decrease rather than an increase, which corrects the overestimation. So we'll estimate a decrease by around 10 degrees Celsius instead of an increase, leading to a revised addition of 70 degrees Celsius to the hexane base.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit for comparison is decane, which has a melting point of -37.6 \u00b0C. The addition of a nitrile group (cyano, -C\u2261N) to a hydrocarbon chain generally increases the melting point due to the introduction of polarity and the ability to form dipole-dipole interactions. The nitrile group is a small, linear molecule that can increase the melting point by about +20 \u00b0C.\n##Prediction: -17.6\n\n##Prediction",
