    "Reason": "The basic structural unit for 2-aminoethanethiol is ethane, which has a melting point of -172. The amino (NH2) group is expected to raise the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities (+100). Additionally, the thiol (SH) group will also contribute to an increase in melting point due to its polar nature and ability to hydrogen bond, albeit weaker than amines (+70). Therefore, we can add these effects to the base melting point of ethane.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, ethane, has a melting point of -183\u00b0C. \n- The presence of an amino group (NH2) generally increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated to add about +100\u00b0C. \n- The thiol group (SH) can also form hydrogen bonds, but its effect is less pronounced than that of an amino group. We might estimate an increase of +50\u00b0C for the thiol group. \n- The overall molecule is small and relatively simple, which could lead to a more predictable melting point.\n##Prediction: 108.0\n\n##Prediction",
