    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of bromine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the enhancement of intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces. Bromobenzene, with one bromine atom, has a melting point of 89 degrees Celsius. Each additional bromine in a symmetrical pattern, like in 1,3,5-tribromobenzene, may increase the melting point more than an asymmetrical pattern due to better crystal packing and stronger intermolecular forces. The second and third substitutions with Br are estimated to contribute less incrementally than the first because of the diminishing returns with increasing molecular size, but the symmetrical substitution may still lead to a higher melting point increment. The incremental increase for the second and third bromine atoms is estimated to be around 16.25 degrees Celsius each.",
