    "Reason": "Meloxicam has several functional groups that affect its melting point. The basic structure can be considered as a thiazole attached to a benzene ring. Thiazoles have a typical melting point of around 90-100\u00b0C, but attachment to a benzene ring and additional functional groups can significantly alter this. The carboxylic acid derivative (COOH) greatly increases melting points (usually by more than 100\u00b0C due to strong hydrogen bonding). Meloxicam has a related acyl group (CO-N) instead of a direct COOH, but it still allows for hydrogen bonding, so a large increase in melting point is expected, though somewhat less than for COOH. The sulfonamide (S(=O)2NH) group is also strongly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, likely contributing a significant increase of about 50-80\u00b0C. The methyl group (CH3) attached to the thiazole slightly raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight, but by a smaller margin, likely 5-10\u00b0C.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the meloxicam core structure, which includes a benzene ring fused with a thiazole and a pyrazole, will significantly increase the melting point due to the rigidity and planarity of the structure, as well as the potential for hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking interactions. This could be estimated at around +150\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the sulfonamide group (-S(=O)(=O)N2C) is known to significantly increase the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, which could be estimated at around +50\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the amide group (-C(=O)NH-) also contributes to hydrogen bonding and could be estimated at around +40\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the nitrogen in the amide may slightly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. \n- The presence of the ethyl group (-C2H5) attached to the nitrogen in the amide may also slightly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. \n- The overall effect of these functional groups is cumulative and will contribute to the melting point of the molecule.\n##Prediction: 255.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
