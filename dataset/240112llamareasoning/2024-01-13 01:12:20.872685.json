    "Reason": "The starting reference compound in this case could be benzene which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The molecular structure of the target compound includes a phenyl group (benzene ring), a methyl group, a carboxylic acid group, and a geminal diol. Each of these functional groups will affect the melting point differently. The methyl group typically raises the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces, which could be by approximately +5\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group forms strong hydrogen bonds, which would greatly increase the melting point, estimated at approximately +80\u00b0C above benzene's melting point. The geminal diol (-C(OH)2) also participates in hydrogen bonding and likely stabilizes the crystal lattice, which could raise the melting point further; for the geminal diol effect, we can consider an additional increase of +30\u00b0C. Phenyl group itself would not largely change the melting point from the benzene baseline as it is part of the reference structure.",
