    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the benzene ring, as in pyrocatechol, significantly affects the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding. However, a 50 degrees Celsius increase for each hydroxyl group seems excessive. Typically, a hydroxyl group can be expected to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, but the effect should be evaluated more conservatively. A range of 20-30 degrees Celsius increase per hydroxyl group is more reasonable. Thus, the combined contribution of two hydroxyl groups would be approximately 40-60 degrees Celsius.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) generally increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated at +40 \u00b0C. The presence of another phenolic hydroxyl group (OH) would further increase the melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding capabilities, estimated at +30 \u00b0C. The overall molecular structure is relatively small and planar, which could contribute to a higher melting point through efficient packing, estimated at +10 \u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 95.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
