    "Reason": "2-Octanone is an eight-carbon chain ketone. The reference compound, octane (an alkane), has a melting point of about -57\u00b0C. Ketones generally have higher melting points than alkanes with similar molecular weights because the carbonyl group (C=O) is polar and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions. However, as the carbon chain becomes longer, the overall polarity of the molecule diminishes because the nonpolar hydrocarbon chain's influence grows. Also, there's no possibility of hydrogen bonding which limits the boiling point elevation. The boiling point is anticipated to increase, but not substantially. For similar ketone compounds, a ketone functional group might raise the melting point by roughly 20-30\u00b0C.",
