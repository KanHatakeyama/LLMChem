    "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Each hydroxyl group (OH) in the molecule contributes to an increase in the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which provides additional intermolecular forces, thus raising the melting point. For aromatic compounds, an OH group can be approximated to raise the melting point by about 80 degrees Celsius, given their strong hydrogen-bonding capabilities. With resorcinol having 2 hydroxyl groups, this increase could, in principle, be additive. However, because the hydroxyl groups are positioned in a meta arrangement with respect to each other, there is an opportunity for intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which can limit the efficiency of intermolecular hydrogen bonding that would otherwise raise the melting point more significantly. Hence, instead of adding 160 degrees Celsius for two OH groups, we might anticipate a lower cumulative effect. As the Actual value is 110 degrees Celsius, and assuming intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the expected impact of the OH groups, the increase in melting point due to two OH groups is estimated to be about 104.5 degrees Celsius (110 - 5.5). This more accurately reflects the actual effect of the functional groups on the melting point.",
