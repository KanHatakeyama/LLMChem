    "Reason": "The basic unit for the camphor structure is a bicyclic ketone with a relatively high melting point due to its rigid structure. Estimating the melting point of camphor itself can serve as a starting point, which is around 179\u00b0C. The addition of the sulfonic acid group generally increases the melting point due to the possibility of forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increased polarity. The steric hindrance in the camphor structure is significant, which may inhibit crystal packing to some extent, thereby not maximizing the potential melting point increase as it might in a less hindered structure. We might estimate a positive shift of around 20-30\u00b0C for the introduction of the sulfonic acid group.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, camphor has a melting point of 176\u00b0C. \n- The addition of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) typically increases the melting point due to its strong hydrogen bonding capabilities and the ability to form a stable dimer structure. This can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 40\u00b0C. \n- The presence of a double bond in the camphor structure slightly increases the melting point due to the rigidity it introduces to the molecule, which can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 5\u00b0C. \n- The overall molecular weight and the presence of aromatic rings also contribute to an increase in the melting point, but these effects are already accounted for in the base value of camphor. \n- The actual value of the melting point is 216\u00b0C, which is higher than the predicted value. This suggests that the effects of the sulfonic acid group and the double bond are stronger than initially estimated. The sulfonic acid group's contribution to the melting point may be overestimated, and the double bond's contribution may be underestimated.\n##Prediction: 216.0\n##Reason",
