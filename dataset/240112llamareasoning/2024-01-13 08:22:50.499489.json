    "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-pentanone is propane, which has a melting point of -187.7 degrees Celsius. Adding two methyl groups should increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each methyl group typically adds about +5 to the melting point. The carbonyl (-C=O) group will increase the melting point significantly due to its ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which is much stronger than the previous interactions. A reasonable estimate for this effect could be about +105 to the melting point.",
