    "Reason": "The basic unit for the prediction is aniline (phenylamine), which has a melting point of around \u22126 \u00b0C. A cyclohexyl group is added to the para position of the benzene ring in 4-cyclohexylbenzenamine. The cyclohexyl group is bulky and non-polar, and it increases the molecular weight significantly compared to a hydrogen atom it replaces. The increased molecular weight and non-polar nature of the cyclohexyl group typically raise the melting point due to greater London dispersion forces. Furthermore, the cyclohexyl substituent introduces steric hindrance, which can disrupt the crystal lattice of the compound, potentially impacting its melting point. The hindrance by the cyclohexyl substituent, however, does not raise the melting point substantially as it does not contribute to intermolecular hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions. Considering the effects, the increase in melting point due to the cyclohexyl group can be estimated to be around 60 \u00b0C.",
