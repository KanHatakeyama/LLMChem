    "Reason": "The target compound, 3,4-Dichlorophenol, incorporates a phenol (hydroxyl-benzene) unit with additional chlorine substituents. Phenol itself has a melting point of approximately 41\u00b0C, much higher than benzene due to the strong hydrogen-bonding capability of the hydroxyl group. Each chlorine substituent, being an electron-withdrawing group, adds to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and the polarity of the molecule. Chlorine's contribution is somewhat less than that of a hydroxyl group due to its lesser impact on intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Considering an approximate increase of +11\u00b0C for each chlorine atom and taking into account that the hydroxyl group's effect is already counted in phenol's base melting point, the predicted melting point would be increased by the effects of the two chlorines.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "- Basic unit, phenol has a melting point of 41\u00b0C. \n- Chloro substituents: Each chloro group is electron-withdrawing and increases the polarity of the molecule, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each chloro group is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C. \n- The presence of two chloro groups on the same phenolic ring will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the additional dipole-dipole interactions.\n##Prediction: 81.0\n##Reason",
