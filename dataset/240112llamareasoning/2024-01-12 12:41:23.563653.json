    "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-pentanone is propane, which has a melting point of -187.7 degrees Celsius. Adding two methyl groups should increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each methyl group typically adds about +5 to the melting point. The carbonyl (-C=O) group will increase the melting point significantly due to its ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which is much stronger than the previous interactions. A reasonable estimate for this effect could be about +105 to the melting point.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The basic unit we can compare to is acetone, which has a melting point of -94.8 degrees Celsius. The addition of a methyl group to the pentane chain generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, the effect of the methyl group on the melting point of 2-pentanone is not as significant as it would be in a longer alkane chain, such as in the case of ethane, which has a melting point of -182.8 degrees Celsius.\n- Acetone base unit: -94.8\n- Methyl group: +5 (increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces)\n- Predicted change: +5\n\n##Prediction: -89.8\n\n##Prediction",
