    "Reason": "The basic unit for 3-aminorhodanine can be considered as rhodanine, which typically has a solid-state due to strong dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding. This is attributed to the presence of sulfur atoms and carbonyl groups, which are strong electron withdrawing groups and contribute to intermolecular attractions, stabilizing the crystal lattice. Rhodanine has a melting point around 175\u00b0C. The amino group at the 3-position could provide additional hydrogen bonding, potentially increasing the melting point, but its effect is limited as the molecule is still relatively small. The addition of an amino group to small molecules generally increases the melting point by +5 to +15\u00b0C due to enhanced hydrogen bonding. The estimated decrease due to flexibility of the molecule is not very significant as the main structure is still a rigid 5-membered ring, so the reduction would only be minor, approximately -5 to -15\u00b0C. Since there's no large alkyl side chain or other bulky substituent that would greatly disrupt the crystal packing, the estimated decrease due to the flexibility of the side chain is calculated modestly.",

    "Test (Predicted reason)": "The target compound, 3-aminorhodanine, has several functional groups that influence its melting point. The base structure is derived from a benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The amino group (-NH2) is capable of hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point due to the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding; we estimate an increase of +80\u00b0C for this effect. The carbonyl group (C=O) contributes to the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding; we estimate an increase of +20\u00b0C for this effect. The presence of the sulfur atom in the compound adds to the molecular weight and potential for van der Waals interactions, but its effect on the melting point is less pronounced than that of the amino or carbonyl groups; we estimate an increase of +10\u00b0C for this effect.\n##Prediction: 115.0\n\n\n#Prediction",
