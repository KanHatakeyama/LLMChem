        "Reason": "The compound n-butyl propionate consists of an ester functional group and two hydrocarbon chains. The ester group is polar and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, which typically increases the melting point. However, the presence of the two long aliphatic chains tends to lower the melting point due to increased flexibility and a decrease in the ability to pack efficiently in a solid state. The longer the hydrocarbon chain, the lower the melting point is likely to be. The basic unit, ethyl acetate (the shortest simple ester), has a melting point of -83.6\u00b0C. The n-butyl group is a four-carbon alkyl chain, which will further decrease the melting point compared to methyl or ethyl groups. The propyl group on the other side of the ester also has a decreasing effect on the melting point. Each additional methylene group in an alkyl chain can typically reduce the melting point by about 5\u00b0C. Thus, adding around three methylene groups to ethyl acetate (considering n-butyl instead of ethyl and propyl instead of methyl), we may expect a notable decrease: Ethyl group as the base: 0; Butyl: -3x5 = -15\u00b0C; Propyl compared to Methyl: -2x5 = -10\u00b0C.",
        "Prediction": "-83.6 (ethyl acetate) - 15 (butyl) - 10 (propyl compared to methyl) = -108.6\u00b0C",

        "Reason": "The compound n-butyl propionate is an ester with two alkyl groups, a propyl and a butyl. Esters generally have higher melting points than alkanes due to the polarity of the carbonyl group, which leads to stronger dipole-dipole interactions. However, when considering alkyl chains, each additional methylene group usually decreases the melting point due to increased molecular flexibility and reduced packing efficiency. Taking ethyl acetate as a starting point with a melting point of -83.6\u00b0C, we adjust for the additional methylene groups in the butyl and propyl chains. For the butyl chain, which has two more methylene groups than the ethyl chain, the decrease is estimated to be 2x5 = 10\u00b0C. The propyl side compared to a methyl side (in ethyl acetate) has one additional methylene group, contributing to a further decrease of 5\u00b0C.",
        "Prediction": "-83.6 (ethyl acetate baseline) - 10 (2 extra methylene in butyl) - 5 (1 extra methylene in propyl compared to methyl) = -98.6\u00b0C",
