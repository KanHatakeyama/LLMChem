The basic unit for considering the melting point is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the carbonyl (C=O) group increases the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, this can roughly add about +40\u00b0C. The presence of two chlorine atoms contributes to the melting point as they add to the molecular weight and provide additional dipole interactions. Each chlorine can roughly add about +20\u00b0C due to halogen's electron-withdrawing nature and the polarity it induces in the molecule. There is a potential steric hindrance between the chlorine atoms at the ortho position, but since melting point is more about packing efficiency in a solid lattice, this steric factor may not significantly lower the melting point in this case.",

The ketone group (C=O) generally increases the melting point due to the polarity it introduces; however, it can vary depending on the molecular context we can estimate a +40 increase. Two chlorine atoms attached to the benzene ring increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, each chlorine can be estimated to contribute +10\u00b0C to the melting point.

The presence of two chlorine atoms on the benzene ring also increases the melting point. Each chlorine is heavy and introduces stronger van der Waals forces, and we can conservatively estimate their collective contribution to be around +20\u00b0C (+10\u00b0C per chlorine).

The basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The ketone group contributes to an increase in melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to the polar carbonyl group which increases intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine substituent is expected to increase the melting point by about +20\u00b0C each, as the increased molecular weight and the enhanced polarity relative to hydrogen in benzene contribute to stronger intermolecular interactions. However, bulky chlorine atoms can introduce steric hindrance that may disrupt the symmetry and tight packing of molecules in the solid phase, which typically reduces the melting point. This steric effect can be estimated as a -5\u00b0C reduction in melting point for the presence of both chlorine atoms. Thus, the net effect should be calculated by adding the individual effects of the basic benzene structure, the ketone group, and both chlorine substituents, minus the correction for the dichloro-substitution's steric effects.",
