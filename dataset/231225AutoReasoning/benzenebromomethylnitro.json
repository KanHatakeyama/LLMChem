        "Reason": "The compound 1-(bromomethyl)-3-nitrobenzene has three key functional groups affecting its melting point: benzene ring, bromomethyl group, and nitro group. The basic benzene unit has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The bromomethyl group typically raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and polarizability, let's approximate this as a +50\u00b0C shift. The nitro group has a strong electron-withdrawing effect and can form internal hydrogen bonds, which may significantly increase the melting point, estimated as a +40\u00b0C shift. Combining these effects, we'd expect a melting point increase of approximately +90\u00b0C over the base benzene unit.",

        "Reason": "The compound 1-(bromomethyl)-3-nitrobenzene includes a benzene ring, a bromomethyl group, and a nitro group, each contributing to the melting point. The base melting point for benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. The bromomethyl group is heavy and introduces polarity, which could increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C due to higher molecular weight and polarity. The nitro group is strongly electronegative, and its electron-withdrawing nature typically raises melting points of aromatic compounds significantly because they can form internal dimer-like interactions through hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at about a 30\u00b0C increase. The cumulative effect of these functional groups shifts the melting point upwards by 50\u00b0C from the base value of benzene.",
