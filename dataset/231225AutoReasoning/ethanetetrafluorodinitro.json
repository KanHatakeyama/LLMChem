        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoro-1,2-dinitroethane, we will analyze the effects of the different functional groups on the basic ethane molecule: \n\n- Ethane (base molecule) has a melting point of -183\u00b0C. \n- Fluoro groups: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative, likely increasing intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole interactions), which can raise the melting point significantly. Adding four fluorine atoms could increase the melting point due to the strong C-F dipole interactions and tight molecular packing. We estimate each fluoro group to raise the melting point by about +30\u00b0C.\n- Nitro groups: Nitro groups are also highly electronegative and can form strong dipoles, attracting other molecules, which would further increase the melting point. The introduction of two nitro groups would likely provide a similar increase to the melting point as fluoro groups. We estimate each nitro group to raise the melting point by about +15\u00b0C.\n\nAdding these effects together: basic ethane melting point (-183\u00b0C) + (4 fluoro groups \times +30\u00b0C) + (2 nitro groups \times +15\u00b0C) gives us the predicted value.",
