        "Reason": "The compound diethyl (2Z)-but-2-enedioate, also known as trans-diethyl fumarate, consists of a main chain derived from fumaric acid with two ester functional groups. For the prediction, consider the following: \n- The basic unit here is fumaric acid, which has a melting point of 287 \u00b0C due to its planar, rigid structure and ability to form strong hydrogen bonds. \n- The substitution of hydrogen atoms with ethoxy groups (OCC) makes the compound less polar and capable of forming fewer hydrogen bonds, which typically lowers the melting point significantly. We can roughly estimate that each ethoxy group will decrease the melting point by approximately 150 \u00b0C from the parent compound (double the effect since there are two). \n- The Z configuration (cis-isomer) does not allow for as efficient packing as the E isomer (trans-fumaric acid), which also slightly lowers the melting point compared to trans isomers; however, since we are already starting from the trans form, there is no additional effect to consider here. \nCombining these effects gives us an estimated shift from the base fumaric acid melting point.",
