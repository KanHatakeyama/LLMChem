        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be ethane, which has a melting point of -183\u00b0C. The double bond in propene adds rigidity to the molecule, which would typically raise the melting point somewhat due to increased intermolecular forces. However, the molecule is still very small, and the difference may not be very large. The presence of the double bond could increase the melting point by approximately 2\u00b0C.",
