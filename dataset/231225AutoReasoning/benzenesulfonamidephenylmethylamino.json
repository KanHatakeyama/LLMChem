        "Reason": "The target compound, benzenesulfonamide, 4-[(phenylmethyl)amino]-, consists of a benzene ring with a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), an amino group (NH2), and another phenyl group (C6H5) attached through a methylene bridge (CH2). The basic benzene unit has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. We anticipate the following effects on the melting point: \n- Sulfonamide group: +80\u00b0C (due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and resonance stabilization) \n- Amino group: +50\u00b0C (due to its capacity for hydrogen bonding, which increases the compound's lattice energy) \n- Phenyl group: +30\u00b0C (due to increased molecular weight and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions) \n- Methylene bridge: +10\u00b0C (due to a slight increase in molecular size) \nThe additive impacts should yield a shift in the melting point relative to benzene.",
