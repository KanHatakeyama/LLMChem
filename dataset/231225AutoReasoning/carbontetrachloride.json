        "Reason": "Target compound: Carbon tetrachloride. The basic unit, methane, has a boiling point of -162 degrees Celsius. Each chlorine atom adds to the molecular weight significantly and also introduces dipole-dipole interactions due to their electronegativity. This would be expected to significantly increase the boiling point. Also, chlorine atoms replace hydrogen atoms which have very little intermolecular force contribution, thus the effect of adding chlorine is more pronounced. Estimating the impact of each Cl could be around +35 degrees Celsius.",
