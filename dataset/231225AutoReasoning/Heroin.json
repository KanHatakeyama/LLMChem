        "Reason": "The basic units for heroin are the opiate structure and the two acetyl groups. A similar base molecule like morphine, which has an opiate structure without acetyl groups, melts at around 255 degrees Celsius. Therefore, we consider the effects of morphine's structure first, and then modifications due to heroin's acetyl groups. Each acetyl group (CH3CO-) is expected to lower the melting point, because acetyl groups make the molecule more hydrophobic and possibly disrupt the crystal lattice, which results in a lower melting point. Estimating the effect of each acetyl group to reduce the melting point around -40 degrees Celsius, we would have a decrease of 80 degrees in total. This is based on the general knowledge of acetyl group's influence on reducing intermolecular forces in other organic compounds, such as acetylated sugars or cellulose.",
