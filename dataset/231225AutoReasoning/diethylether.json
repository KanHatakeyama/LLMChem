        "Reason": "The basic unit, ethane, has a melting point of -182.8\u00b0C. When we transform part of ethane into an ether group (as in diethyl ether), the following changes affect the melting point: the presence of the oxygen atom introduces differences in polarity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, although diethyl ether itself cannot engage in hydrogen bonding since it lacks a hydrogen atom bound to oxygen. The increased molecular size due to the additional carbons from the ethyl groups increases the London dispersion forces. However, each ether linkage reduces the melting point by a certain amount because it does not provide as much opportunity for strong intermolecular interactions as other functional groups might. The total effect of these changes leads to an increase in the melting point compared to ethane, but still at a relatively low value due to the lack of other more influential functional groups. For ethers, we might consider the influence of the oxygen atom to provide +40\u00b0C to the melting point and each additional ethyl group to provide approximately +13\u00b0C.",
