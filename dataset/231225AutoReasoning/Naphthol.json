        "Reason": "Basic unit, naphthalene, has a melting point of 80.5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group (-OH) increases hydrogen bonding, which typically raises the melting point significantly. The additional aromatic ring present in naphthalene compared to benzene provides greater surface area for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and van der Waals forces, which generally increase the melting point. For the hydroxyl group an estimated increase of about +40\u00b0C due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and for the additional aromatic ring, an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular interactions can be considered.",
