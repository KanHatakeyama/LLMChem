        "Reason": "The target compound malonaldehyde has two functional groups that significantly influence its melting point: two aldehyde groups (O=CH-) and a single carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Starting with the base structure of methane (melting point = -182.5\u00b0C), which only presents C-H bonds, we assess how these functional groups affect the melting point. Each aldehyde group increases the melting point due to increased polarity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which strengthens intermolecular attractions. We can estimate this increase to be +120\u00b0C for each aldehyde group. The carbon-carbon double bond typically contributes less to the melting point than polar functional groups but can still add some rigidity to the molecule, affecting intermolecular forces. We can estimate an increase of +5\u00b0C for the C=C bond. Altogether, with two aldehyde groups and one C=C bond, the cumulative increase would be (2*120) + 5 = +245\u00b0C.",
