        "Reason": "The basic unit to consider here is ethene (ethylene), which has a typical melting point around -169.2\u00b0C. Each additional carbon in a hydrocarbon generally increases the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. However, in conjugated dienes such as 1,4-pentadiene, the conjugation can weaken intermolecular interactions due to increased delocalization of electrons, causing a lower melting point compared to non-conjugated analogs. The two double bonds in 1,4-pentadiene might be expected to increase the melting point due to rigidity but the effect of conjugation is stronger, leading to a decreased melting point. As 1,4-pentadiene has two additional carbon atoms relative to ethene and is conjugated, the increase due to additional carbon atoms is less pronounced. Assuming the rough effect of each additional carbon atom increases the melting point by about +2.5\u00b0C (based on comparable aliphatic hydrocarbons), and delta for conjugation is approximately -10\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C, we have: -169.2 + (3 * 2.5) - 12.5",
