        "Reason": "Heptadecyl alcohol (C17H35OH) has a long hydrocarbon chain which contributes to the dispersion forces between molecules; this increases the melting point. - Alkanes with similar chain length (e.g., hexadecane C16H34) have a melting point around 18\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group (OH) in heptadecyl alcohol forms hydrogen bonds, which substantially increases the melting point. For comparison, a smaller alcohol such as octanol (C8H17OH) has a melting point around -15\u00b0C. However, the longer alkyl chain in heptadecyl alcohol leads to a much higher increase. - Each additional -CH2- group in a hydrocarbon chain can increase the melting point by about 2-3\u00b0C, taking the melting point of hexadecane as a starting point. - Hydroxyl group: +35\u00b0C (estimated based on the additional hydrogen bonding capacity compared to hexadecane).",
