        "Reason": "Starting from the basic unit of butanedioic acid (succinic acid) with an estimated melting point of 188\u00b0C, we consider functional group modifications. The presence of a monobutyl ester instead of one carboxylic acid group generally lowers the melting point because esters have a lower melting point than carboxylic acids due to less hydrogen bonding capacity. The alkyl group (butyl) on the ester may slightly increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, since increasing the ester's alkyl chain generally lowers the melting point, the combined effect results in a net decrease. The lose of symmetry also affects the decrease in melting point. Estimating the butyl group to reduce the melting point by roughly 120 degrees due to these factors, and a slightly smaller change for the second -COOH replaced with a hydrogen, by approximately 20 degrees.",

The presence of a monobutyl ester instead of one carboxylic acid group generally lowers the melting point because esters have lesser capability for hydrogen bonding than carboxylic acids, significantly reducing the compound's ability to crystallize. The replacement of a -COOH with -OCCCC should reduce the melting point substantially, potentially by around 150 degrees due to the loss of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the loss of molecular symmetry contributes to lowering the melting point. The remaining carboxylic acid group provides some capability for hydrogen bonding, but its influence is less compared to the original diacid, reducing the melting point by another 30 degrees.",
