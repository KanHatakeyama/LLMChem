        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 2-chloro-D-phenylalanine, we must consider the effects of each functional group on the basic benzene structure. Benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of a chlorine (Cl) atom to the benzene ring generally increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and polarity; this can be estimated as +40\u00b0C. The amino acid backbone, consisting of an amine (-NH2) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) group attached to a secondary carbon, contributes significantly to the melting point through the ability for strong hydrogen bonding and zwitterionic interactions; this could add approximately +150\u00b0C. The steric hindrance of the phenyl group also contributes to the melting point, potentially adding about +20\u00b0C. These estimated additions are cumulative, as they each independently contribute to an increase in the melting point.",
