        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of cinnamyl anthranilate, we need to look at the functional groups and overall structure. Starting from benzene as a base unit with a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we consider the following functional groups in cinnamyl anthranilate: the anthranilate ester (C(=O)OC), the cinnamyl double bond (C=C), and two phenyl rings. Esters generally raise the melting point due to increased polarizability and possible hydrogen bonding, but the effect is diminished in non-hydroxyl esters, let's assign a +20\u00b0C. The cinnamyl double bond and additional alkenyl linkage may reduce symmetry which leads to a lower melting point due to lower crystal packing efficiency, let's assign a -10\u00b0C. Each phenyl ring typically increases the melting point because of stronger van der Waals forces and the potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, each contributing +30\u00b0C. Considering the nitrogen in the amide might form hydrogen bonds, increasing the melting point slightly, we will add +5\u00b0C for that effect.",
