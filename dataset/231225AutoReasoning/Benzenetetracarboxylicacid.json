        "Reason": "Benzene as the basic unit has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. Carboxylic acid groups are known to significantly increase melting points due to their ability to form strong hydrogen bonds. The addition of four carboxylic acids to the benzene ring would substantially increase the compound's melting point. Each carboxylic acid could be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 70\u00b0C due to the possibility of extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the associated increase in the molecular weight and rigidity of the molecule. Additionally, since the molecule is symmetrical and the carboxyl groups can potentially form a highly stable and rigid network, further stabilization might occur, slightly enhancing the melting point.",
