        "Reason": "The target compound is pentafluorobenzoic acid with a di-tert-butylcarbamoyl group attached. Starting with benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122.41 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents on the aromatic ring tend to increase melting points due to the electronegative nature of fluorine enhancing the rigidity of the molecular structure and intermolecular interactions. Each fluorine could be considered to add approximately 5 degrees Celsius. We have five fluorines, which would sum up to +25 degrees Celsius. The di-tert-butylcarbamoyl group introduces steric bulk and strong intermolecular interactions due to possible hydrogen bonding, which would raise the melting point significantly. The estimation for such a large group could be around +50 degrees Celsius. Summing these up gives us a total increase of 75 degrees Celsius.",
