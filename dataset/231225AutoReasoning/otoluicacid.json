        "Reason": "The benzene ring is the basic structural unit which has a known melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of a methyl group (CH3-) increases this value due to the slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, this can be estimated to be an increase of about +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) substantially increases the melting point because of the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding it introduces. Typically, a carboxylic acid group contributes an increase of about +80\u00b0C. Since o-toluic acid has both of these groups ortho to each other, there may be a slight steric hindrance that prevents effective intermolecular interactions from reaching their full potential, which might marginally lower the melting point by about -0.5\u00b0C compared to what one might expect if the groups were not interacting",
