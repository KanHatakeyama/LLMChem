        "Reason": "The basic structure of quinoline has a melting point of around 23\u00b0C. The presence of the hydroxy (-OH) group introduces hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point. Based on similar compounds, the hydroxy group is estimated to add around 50\u00b0C to the melting point of the core structure. Thus, the presence of the hydroxy group significantly increases the melting point of 8-hydroxyquinoline compared to quinoline.",
