        "Reason": "The compound (2E)-2-hydrazono-1-naphthalen-1-yl-2-phenylethanone is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups that influence its melting point. The base structure can be considered as naphthalene, which has a melting point of 80.2 degrees Celsius. The addition of a phenyl group would generally increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, potentially by around +20 degrees Celsius. The ketone functional group typically raises the melting point as well due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions; we can estimate this increase to be around +20 degrees Celsius. The hydrazone group can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which would raise the melting point; we can estimate this as +30 degrees Celsius. Thus, considering the cumulative effects of naphthalene as the base unit (80.2) and the added functional groups, we add up the shifts: 80.2 (naphthalene base) + 20 (phenyl group) + 20 (ketone group) + 30 (hydrazone group).",
