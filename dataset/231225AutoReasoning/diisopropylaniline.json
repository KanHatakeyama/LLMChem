        "Reason": "The basic unit here is aniline, which has a melting point of -6\u00b0C. The presence of the isopropyl groups in 2,6-diisopropylaniline will increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the bulkiness that hinders rotation around the bond, making the molecule more rigid. Each isopropyl group is large and should have a significant impact on the melting point. However, branched alkyl groups like isopropyl can also introduce steric hindrance that may disrupt the crystal lattice, reducing the melting point. Considering these factors, one might expect each isopropyl group to increase the melting point by about 20-30\u00b0C. However, the actual value shows a decrease, indicating that the steric hindrance has a greater effect than anticipated. The combined effect of the two isopropyl groups seems to decrease the melting point, contrary to what might be expected from molecular weight considerations alone.",
