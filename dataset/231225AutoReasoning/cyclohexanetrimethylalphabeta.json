        "Reason": "The basic unit is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. Each methyl group on the cyclohexane should slightly lower the melting point due to the introduction of bulk which can disrupt the crystal lattice making it less stable and more prone to melting at a lower temperature. Given that there are three methyl groups and considering the 1,2,3- arrangement providing some level of steric hindrance, an estimated decrease of about 10\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C per methyl group could be a rough approximation.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, cyclohexane, has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. Introducing each methyl group can slightly lower the melting point as it creates steric hindrance which disrupts the orderly packing of molecules in the solid state. Given that we have not only the steric bulk but also a 1,2,3- arrangement of the methyl groups, which enhances the disruption in the crystal lattice, we can consider a more pronounced effect per methyl group. A calculated decrease of about 20-25\u00b0C for each methyl group seems more accurate, taking into account the combined effect of the three methyl groups in adjacent positions.",
