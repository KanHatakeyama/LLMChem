        "Reason": "The molecule 2,6-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde contains several functional groups that affect its melting point when compared to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group (-OH) forms hydrogen bonds, significantly increasing the melting point, this can be estimated as +100. Each fluorine atom in the aromatic ring, due to its high electronegativity and size, can also increase the melting point; an estimate for each fluorine atom's effect could be around +20. The aldehyde group (C=O) contributes to the rigidity and polarity of the molecule, and can raise the melting point further; this effect can be predicted as +30. All influences combined would therefore shift the melting point upwards.",
