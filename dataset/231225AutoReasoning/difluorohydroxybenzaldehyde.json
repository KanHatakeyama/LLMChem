        "Reason": "The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of aldehyde group (-CHO) typically raises the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding with other molecules, adding approximately +40\u00b0C. Each fluorine atom, due to its high electronegativity, induces dipole-dipole interactions that increases the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds and can increase the melting point significantly, estimated at +50\u00b0C. Therefore, the collective influence of these functional groups is calculated by summing their individual effects.",

        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, we will consider the effects of individual functional groups on the basic phenyl ring. \n- Basic phenyl ring has a reference melting point of approximately 122\u00b0C (considering biphenyl as a close reference). \n- Hydroxy group: -20\u00b0C (due to the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds that can cause higher intermolecular bonding, leading to an increased melting point; however, this increase tends to be less in case of melting points as compared to boiling points and might be offset by other groups). \n- Fluorine atoms (2x): +40\u00b0C (each fluorine being highly electronegative tends to enhance intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions; 20\u00b0C increase per fluorine atom). \n- Aldehyde group: -10\u00b0C (folded structure due to the conjugation with the ring might lower the symmetry leading to decreased melting point). \n- Overall, the expected net increase is around +10\u00b0C taking into account all of the adjustments above.",
