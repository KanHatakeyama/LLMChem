        "Reason": "The compound (2,4-Dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid has several functional groups that influence its melting point: \n- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Two chlorine atoms on the benzene ring generally increase the melting point approximately +80\u00b0C (due to the increase in molecular weight and polarity, +40\u00b0C each). \n- The phenoxy (phenyl ether) group increases the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C because of the additional atomic mass and the dipole-dipole interactions it introduces. \n- The acetic acid group increases the melting point significantly, possibly by +70\u00b0C, due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and the polarity it adds to the molecule. \nCombining the effects of the above functional groups, the predicted melting point is calculated.",
