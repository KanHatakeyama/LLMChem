        "Reason": "The core structure of ubenimex can be considered to be benzoic acid, which has a melting point of around 122 degrees Celsius. The modifications to consider include: an isobutyl group, an alpha-amino group, a secondary amine connected to an aromatic ring, an amide group, and a hydroxyl group. The isobutyl group (+40) will raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The alpha-amino group (+20) will contribute to hydrogen-bonding capabilities, raising the melting point. The secondary amine connected to an aromatic ring (+10) will contribute more to the molecular weight and add some dipole-dipole interactions. The amide group (+20) is another site for hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point. Finally, the hydroxyl group (+10) introduces an additional site for hydrogen bonding. The effects of these functional groups are considered additive.",

The isobutyl group (+30) will raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The alpha-amino group (+10) will contribute to hydrogen-bonding capabilities, raising the melting point, but less so than a primary amino group due to steric hindrance. The secondary amine connected to an aromatic ring (+5) will have a slight increase in molecular weight and some limited hydrogen-bonding potential. The amide group (+40) is a strong site for hydrogen bonding, significantly raising the melting point. Finally, the hydroxyl group (+20) introduces an additional strong site for hydrogen bonding.
