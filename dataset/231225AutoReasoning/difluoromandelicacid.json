        "Reason": "The basic structure to be considered for 2,5-difluoromandelic acid is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Each fluorine on the benzene ring, being highly electronegative, exerts an inductive effect that stabilizes the molecule and thus increases its melting point. There are two fluorine atoms present, so this effect is considered twice. A hydroxyl group, due to its capability of forming hydrogen bonds, will significantly increase the melting point, while the adjacent carboxylic acid group, which can also form hydrogen bonds, increases it even further. Finally, there is an additional secondary alcohol adjacent to the carboxylic acid, which can engage in hydrogen bonding and thus raises the melting point even more. Considering these impacts in terms of increment for the melting point: each fluorine might add an estimated +20 degrees Celsius for its electron-withdrawing effect and contribution to molecular stability through induction and resonance, the hydroxyl group +80 degrees Celsius for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and the carboxylic acid group +100 degrees Celsius for being a highly polar functional group also capable of strong hydrogen bonding. The additional hydroxyl group of the secondary alcohol would contribute less than the primary because it is not directly attached to the benzene but still notable, so we might estimate an additional +50 degrees Celsius.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (base for benzene) + 40 (2 x +20 for each F) + 80 (for the hydroxyl group) + 100 (for the carboxylic acid group) + 50 (for the secondary alcohol) = 275.5 degrees Celsius",
        "Prediction(integer)": 275.0
