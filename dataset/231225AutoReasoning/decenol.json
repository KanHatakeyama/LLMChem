        "Reason": "The basic unit for the compound, 1-decene, has an approximate melting point of -54.5\u00b0C. The addition of a hydroxyl group (OH) typically increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which is strong intermolecular force. Taking into account the effect of the hydroxyl group, which can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 40-70\u00b0C as possible in other alcohols, balancing against the fact that the non-polar decene chain retains flexibility which lowers the melting point, a conservative estimate would be an increase by 40\u00b0C.",
