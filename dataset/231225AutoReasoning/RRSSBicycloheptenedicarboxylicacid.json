        "Reason": "The basic unit here is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of functional groups and structural complexity will lead to a shift in the melting point. The addition of a double bond in the bicyclic structure increases molecular rigidity, which usually leads to a higher melting point. Estimation for double bond: +20. Two carboxylic acid groups are present, and each has a strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding capability that greatly increases melting point due to the required energy to break these interactions. Estimation for each carboxylic acid group: +60. Additionally, the bicyclic structure creates strain and geometric constraint, which can further increase the melting point. However, predicting the exact magnitude of this effect is complex. Estimation for bicyclic structure: +10. Summing these effects gives an estimated melting point of 6.5 (cyclohexane) + 20 (double bond) + 120 (two carboxylic acid groups) + 10 (bicyclic strain) = 156.5 degrees Celsius.",
