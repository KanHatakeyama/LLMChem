        "Reason": "The basic structural unit here is nonane, a straight chain alkane with nine carbon atoms which has a melting point of approximately -54\u00b0C. Adding a fluorine atom to the compound to form 1-fluorononane induces a polar character to the molecule and causes an increase in melting point. Polar bonds can introduce dipole-dipole interactions alongside the van der Waals forces present in non-polar alkanes. The fluorine substituent is an electron withdrawing group, which introduces some polarity but the single substituent effect is relatively modest. We can estimate the increase due to fluorine to be around +55\u00b0C considering its higher electronegativity and the resultant dipole-dipole interactions, while also noting that the larger alkane backbone still largely influences the melting point to remain below room temperature.",
