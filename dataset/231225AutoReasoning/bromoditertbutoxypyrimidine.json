        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 5-bromo-2,4-di-(tert-butoxy)pyrimidine, we need to consider the influences of different functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit, pyrimidine, has a melting point of around 20-22 degrees Celsius. Each tert-butoxy group is expected to increase the melting point due to increased steric hindrance and molecular weight; let's assign a value of +15 for each tert-butoxy group. The bromo substituent is also a heavy atom compared to hydrogen and thus increases the molecular weight; we can estimate its effect on the melting point to be around +10. Since there are two tert-butoxy groups, their combined effect would be +30. Combining these effects, we get: Base pyrimidine: +20, Two tert-butoxy groups: +30 (2 * +15), Bromo substituent: +10, Total predicted increase: 20 + 30 + 10 = +60\u00b0C",
