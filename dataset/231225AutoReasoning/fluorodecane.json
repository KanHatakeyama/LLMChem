        "Reason": "The basic unit, decane, has a melting point of around -30\u00b0C. The fluorine substituent is slightly electron-withdrawing and could cause a dipole in the molecule, which might slightly increase the intermolecular forces and thus the melting point. However, its effect is not significant enough due to the length of the carbon chain which dilutes its influence. Fluorine substituent: -5\u00b0C (slightly lowers the melting point due to minor effect on long carbon chain).",
