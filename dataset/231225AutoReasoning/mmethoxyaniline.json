        "Reason": "The structure of m-methoxyaniline is based on an aniline (an amino-substituted benzene) core. Aniline itself has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group (-OCH3) is an electron-donating group which generally increases melting point due to improved molecular packing, we might consider this effect to be around +5 degrees Celsius. The amino group (-NH2) is also an electron-donating group, reinforcing the aromatic system and further increasing the melting point, let's consider this effect to be similar to that of the methoxy group, adding another +5 degrees Celsius.",
