        "Reason": "The compound (2E)-3-Phenylacrylic acid can be broken down by its functional groups when considering its melting point: base unit (benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C). The alkene group (C=C) will typically raise the melting point due to its rigidity and the ability to stack better in the solid state, contributing effect could be around +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) significantly increases melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dimer formation; its contribution is approximately +70\u00b0C. Finally, the substitution of a hydrogen in benzene by the acrylic acid side-chain (-CH=CH-COOH) will add to both molecular weight and the overall polarity, which leads to stronger intermolecular interactions and thus raises the melting point, adding around +37.5\u00b0C. Therefore, the cumulative effect of these groups would be the addition of these values to the base unit of benzene.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point of (2E)-3-Phenylacrylic acid is approximately 5.5 (benzene) + 20 (alkene) + 70 (carboxylic acid) + 37.5 (substitution effect) = 133.0\u00b0C.",
