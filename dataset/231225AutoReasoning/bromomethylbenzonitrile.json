        "Reason": "Starting from the basic unit benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, we will consider the two substituents present in 3-(bromomethyl)benzonitrile. First, the cyano (-C\u2261N) group is an electron-withdrawing group that generally increases melting point due to enhanced dipole moments and potential for intermolecular interactions. The increase could be estimated at about +75 degrees Celsius for strong polar groups like a nitrile. Second, the bromomethyl (-CH2Br) group is a larger, electron-withdrawing group that can also increase melting point due to added mass and polarizability; we might estimate an increase of +25 degrees due to the bromine atom's significant size and contribution to the dipole. Combining these effects gives us the predicted melting point.",

        "Reason": "Starting from the basic unit benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, the introduction of a cyano (-C\u2261N) group contributes significantly to the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature and capacity to form dipoles, potentially increasing the melting point by +80 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the bromomethyl (-CH2Br) group, with its heavy bromine atom, is likely to further increase the melting point by approximately +15 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and polar interactions it brings to the molecule. Summing these effects, we arrive at an estimated melting point for the molecule.",
