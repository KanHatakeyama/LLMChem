        "Reason": "Starting with hexane as the basic unit, which has a melting point of around -95\u00b0C. The introduction of a double bond in 2-hexene raises the melting point due to the more restricted rotation around the double bond, we could estimate this to raise the melting point by around +5\u00b0C. A methyl group usually lowers the melting point, because it may disrupt the ability of the molecule to pack efficiently, often reducing intermolecular forces such as London dispersion forces. The effect of a methyl group in this case could be estimated to lower the melting point by around -5\u00b0C. The cis configuration typically results in a lower melting point compared to the trans configuration because the trans isomer packs better in a crystal lattice due to its more linear shape. Thus, we would predict the cis isomer to have a slight decrease in melting point, estimated at about -2\u00b0C.",

A methyl group typically lowers the melting point because it can disrupt the ability of the molecule to pack efficiently in the crystal lattice, often reducing intermolecular forces such as London dispersion forces; the effect in this case might lower the melting point by around -10\u00b0C. The cis configuration can have a mixed effect depending on the precise structure and packing possibilities, but given the overall steric considerations, it may lead to a slight decrease in melting point when compared to a straight chain alkane, estimated to be about -5\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, ethene, has a melting point of -169.2. Each additional methylene group (CH2) adds about +8 to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The 3-methyl group causes a slight increase, about +5, because it introduces branching, which makes the molecule more spherical, reducing surface area and intermolecular forces. The cis-2 double bond lowers the melting point because cis alkenes pack less efficiently than their trans counterparts or alkanes, thus we'll subtract about -5. The compound has 4 extra methylene groups and one methyl group compared to ethene. Predicted adjustments: 4 methylene groups x (+8) + 3-methyl group (+5) - cis-2 double bond (-5).",
