        "Reason": "The base structure for 2-isopropoxyethanol can be considered as ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The addition of an isopropoxy group (\u2013O\u2013C(CH3)2) increases the molecular weight and provides more surface area for van der Waals interactions but also introduces steric hindrance and a greater level of branching, which tends to decrease the melting point. The isopropoxy group is rather bulky compared to alkyl groups, so the net effect is a moderate increase in melting point due to the increased interactions overcoming the branching effect. However, the hydroxyl (-OH) group has the potential to form hydrogen bonds, which considerably raises the melting point. Considering the effects: Ethanol base: -114.1; Isopropoxy: +30 (due to higher molecular weight and increased van der Waals interactions, but moderated by branching); Hydroxyl group: +24 (due to hydrogen bonding abilities). Thus, the overall shift due to functional groups is estimated at +54 degrees Celsius.",
