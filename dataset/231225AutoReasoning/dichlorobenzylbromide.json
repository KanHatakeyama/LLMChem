        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of chlorine substituents generally increases the melting point due to their electronegative nature, the inductive effect, and increased intermolecular interactions like dipole-dipole attractions. Each chlorine is estimated to add about +40 \u00b0C due to these reasons. The bromide functional group is a larger halogen compared to chlorine and will likely lower the melting point due to its steric bulk, which hinders the packing of the molecules, estimated at -10 \u00b0C. With two chlorines, the increase is 2 * (+40 \u00b0C), and one bromide group leads to a decrease of -10 \u00b0C.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (benzene) + 2*(+40) (chlorines) - 10 (bromide) = 75.5",
