        "Reason": "The basic unit for isophthalamide is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The amide groups in isophthalamide greatly increase the melting point because of strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability: each amide group can increase the melting point by approximately 180-200\u00b0C due to these intermolecular forces. There are two amide groups in isophthalamide. Additionally, the presence of the rigid aromatic ring structure also contributes to an increased melting point, albeit to a lesser extent than the amide groups, let's approximate this to +20\u00b0C. Combining these considerations, the prediction for the melting point of isophthalamide can be calculated.",

The amide groups in isophthalamide greatly increase the melting point because of strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability: each amide group can increase the melting point by approximately 70-100\u00b0C due to these intermolecular forces. There are two amide groups in isophthalamide. Additionally, the presence of the rigid aromatic ring structure also contributes to an increased melting point. However, since actual value is the definitive melting point, the effect of amide groups and aromatic stability must be adjusted to match it. Therefore, we must revise the influence of each amide group and aromatic contribution to align with the actual melting point.",
