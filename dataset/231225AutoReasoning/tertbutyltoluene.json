        "Reason": "The target compound is 4-tert-butyltoluene, which is a substituted benzene molecule like toluene. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The additions to the benzene ring affect the melting point as follows: - The methyl (CH3) group in toluene raises the melting point by about 1\u00b0C compared to benzene, because of the slightly increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Toluene has a melting point of 6\u00b0C. - The tert-butyl (C(CH3)3) group is much bulkier than a methyl group and increases the melting point further. However, its big, bulky nature also introduces steric hindrance and disrupts the crystal lattice, which in turn can lower the melting point. The effect on the melting point due to the tert-butyl group can be estimated in a range of -40 to -50\u00b0C compared to the methyl group in toluene, because of its bulkiness. So the predicted melting point shift due to the tert-butyl group is from toluene's melting point of 6\u00b0C minus 40 to 50\u00b0C for the tert-butyl group.",

The presence of a methyl group (CH3), like in toluene, slightly raises the melting point due to a minor increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Toluene's melting point is 6\u00b0C, a 0.5\u00b0C increase from benzene. With the introduction of a tert-butyl group, there is a significant increase in molecular size and steric hindrance, which tends to disrupt the crystal lattice, potentially lowering the melting point significantly. The tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) is estimated to lower the melting point compared to toluene (with just a methyl group) by about 70 to 80\u00b0C due to its to the increased steric hindrance. The prediction accounts for a reduction from the toluene melting point because of these effects.",
