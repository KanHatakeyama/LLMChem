        "Reason": "For the compound 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzoic acid, we start with the melting point of benzoic acid as a basic unit, which is approximately 122 degrees Celsius. Each fluorine atom added to the aromatic ring is generally known to increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity and the inductive effect, which strengthens the intermolecular forces. The inductive effect from fluorine atoms would increase the polarity and the melting point; each F could be estimated to add about +5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the carboxyl group (CO2H) already exists in benzoic acid, so no change due to this group is added. Since there are four fluorine atoms, we sum the effects: 4(F) * +5. This results in a predicted increase of +20 degrees Celsius from the base melting point of benzoic acid.",
