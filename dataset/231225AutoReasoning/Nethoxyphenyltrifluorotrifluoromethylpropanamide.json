        "Reason": "Basic unit, acetanilide has a melting point of around 114. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group increases the melting point due to the electron-withdrawing inductive effect and the increased molecular weight, at about +20. The additional three fluorine atoms on the ethyl side chain further increase the melting point due to their strong electron-withdrawing properties and additional molecular weight, at about +30. The ethoxy group attached to the phenyl ring also adds to the molecular weight and provides additional steric hindrance, slightly increasing the melting point by about +5. The cumulative effects of these functional groups can be used to predict the melting point.",

        "Reason": "The base molecule, acetanilide, has a melting point of approximately 114 degrees Celsius. The trifluoromethyl group is a strongly electron-withdrawing group due to the high electronegativity of fluorine, which increases intermolecular forces and consequently raises the melting point; this effect might add around +20. The three fluorine atoms on the ethyl side chain also exert a significant electron-withdrawing inductive effect, and their additional molecular weight would contribute to a higher melting point; their cumulative effect may be estimated at around +30. The ethoxy functional group attached to the aromatic ring, through its increased molecular weight and steric bulk, should contribute to raising the melting point further, estimated at about +17. Summing these increments, a predicted melting point can be calculated.",
