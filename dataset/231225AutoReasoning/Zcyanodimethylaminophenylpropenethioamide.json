        "Reason": "The compound (2Z)-2-cyano-3-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]prop-2-enethioamide is composed of several functional groups, which affect its melting point. Starting with benzene as the basic unit with a reference melting point (5.5\u00b0C for benzene), we will consider the following groups and their estimated effects on the melting point: the cyano group (C#N), which is known to increase the melting point due to the presence of a triple bond and the ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions, we estimate an increase of about +80\u00b0C; the thioamide group (S=C(N)C), which has the potential for hydrogen bonding and resonance stability, may contribute another +60\u00b0C; the vinyl group (C=C), can contribute to some rigidity but may have a less pronounced effect than the other groups, it may add about +10\u00b0C; the dimethylamino group ((N(C)C)), is an electron-donating group which could increase the density of electrons in the aromatic ring leading to possible intermolecular interactions, further increasing the melting point by around +30\u00b0C. In summary, starting from 5.5\u00b0C for benzene, the total estimated increase would be 5.5 (for benzene) + 80 (cyano) + 60 (thioamide) + 10 (vinyl) + 30 (dimethylamino) = 185.5\u00b0C.",
