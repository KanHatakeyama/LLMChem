        "Reason": "The basic structure for comparison will start with butanamide, which has a typical melting point range for amides of around 115\u00b0C. The analysis of functional groups is as follows: \n- Methyl groups (three): These groups are typically electron-donating and slightly increase the molecular weight, but in the case of melting point, they could reduce intermolecular forces slightly due to the branching they introduce, decreasing melting point. Each methyl may reduce the melting point by about 5\u00b0C. \n- Isopropyl group (one): This larger alkyl group can further decrease the melting point by reducing intermolecular interactions due to increased steric hindrance. It may contribute a reduction of around 10\u00b0C. \n- Tertiary butyl group (one): This group introduces significant steric hindrance and branching, which can disrupt the packing of molecules further reducing the melting point substantially. It could contribute to a reduction of roughly 30\u00b0C.\n Considering these adjustments to the starting point of butanamide, the melting point reductions can be summed to find the predicted melting point.",
