        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of N-butylurea, we need to consider the effects of its functional groups and molecular structure. The basic unit of urea has a melting point of about 133\u00b0C, and its high melting point is due to its ability to form extensive hydrogen bonding. The N-butyl group is a hydrophobic alkyl chain, which will generally tend to lower the melting point due to a decreasing ability for hydrogen bonding as a larger hydrophobic group is added. However, the long carbon chain can increase melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. Additionally, the presence of N-butyl may also impose steric hindrance, affecting the solidity of the molecular crystal lattice. Overall, the melting point of N-butylurea can be expected to be lower than that of urea because the ability of the molecule to form a rigid hydrogen-bond network is decreased substantially. Quantitatively, the addition of N-butyl may lower the melting point of urea by around -38\u00b0C.",
