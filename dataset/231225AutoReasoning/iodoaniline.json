        "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit of aniline which has a melting point of around -6 degrees Celsius, various functional groups will contribute to the alteration of this melting point. The iodine substituent is large and heavy, which generally increases the melting point due to the increased London dispersion forces. The presence of an iodine atom on the benzene ring ortho- to the amine group can also enhance the overall symmetry and packing in the crystalline state, which leads to an increased melting point. The inductive effect of iodine may slightly decrease the electron density on the amine group, enhancing hydrogen bonding. This would also increase the melting point. However, this effect is expected to be small. Overall, we can estimate an increase: Iodine substituent: +30 degrees Celsius due to larger molecular weight and better packing.",
