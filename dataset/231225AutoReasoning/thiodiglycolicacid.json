        "Reason": "The target compound thiodiglycolic acid (HOOCCH(SH)CH2COOH) consists of a 2-hydroxyethane backbone with two carboxylic acid functional groups and a thiol (sulfhydryl) group. The basic unit we can start with is ethane, which has a very low melting point since it is a gas at room temperature due to its small size and lack of polar functional groups. Adding carboxylic acid groups significantly raises the melting point because carboxylic acids can form strong hydrogen bonds and dimerize, and the two carboxylic groups in thiodiglycolic acid can even form intramolecular hydrogen bonds which further enhances the boiling point. Additionally, the presence of an -OH and -SH group also allows for hydrogen bonding. We will consider the effects of each functional group on the melting point: \n- Ethane basic unit: -172 (melting point of ethane)\n- Carboxylic acid groups: +250 each (strong hydrogen bonding leading to dimerization)\n- Hydroxyl group: +40 (ability to form hydrogen bonds)\n- Thiol group: +20 (somewhat weaker hydrogen bonding compared to hydroxyl)\n- Connecting Sulfur Atom: +10 (adds some polar character and atomic mass but doesn't contribute significantly to intermolecular forces),\n- Intramolecular hydrogen bonding: +21 (stabilization due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding between -OH and -SH with -COOH groups)\nThe prediction will be the sum of these effects.",
