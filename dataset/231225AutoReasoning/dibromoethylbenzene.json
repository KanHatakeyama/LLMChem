        "Reason": "The target compound, (1,2-dibromoethyl)benzene, is based on the benzene structure which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The addition of an ethyl group typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, by approximately +20 \u00b0C. Each bromine atom is also relatively large and heavy, and its introduction tends to increase melting points further due to the increased polarizability and stronger intermolecular attractions; for each bromine, we can conservatively add about +24 \u00b0C to the melting point. Therefore, the combined effect of the ethyl group and two bromine atoms should raise the melting point considerably.",
