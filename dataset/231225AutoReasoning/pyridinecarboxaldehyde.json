        "Reason": "The basic unit for pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde is pyridine, which has a melting point of around -42 degrees Celsius. Adding an aldehyde functional group generally increases the melting point due to the increased possibility for hydrogen bonding. However, given that the actual value of pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde is 8 degrees Celsius, the aldehyde group does not increase the melting point as much as it might in other cases. For pyridine, we expect an increase, but not a substantial one, because the nitrogen in the pyridine ring can also participate in hydrogen bonding and the ring system already provides some rigidity. The aldehyde group is likely to add approximately 50 degrees Celsius to the melting point in this context.",
