        "Reason": "The target compound is 2-chloropyridine-4-carboxylic acid. The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of 115\u00b0C. The chloro group is expected to increase the melting point due to the possibility of stronger intermolecular interactions like dipole-dipole attractions (+40). The carboxylic acid group is also expected to significantly raise the melting point since it can form strong hydrogen bonds and also increase the molecular weight (+75). Taking into account the effects of both the chlorine and carboxylic acid functional groups, we can sum their individual effects to the basic pyridine unit.",
