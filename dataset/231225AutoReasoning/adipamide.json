        "Reason": "The target compound, adipamide, is based on a aliphatic chain with two amide groups. The basic unit we can consider is hexane, which has a melting point of around -95\u00b0C. Amide groups significantly increase melting points due to strong hydrogen bonding capabilities. Each amide group can contribute approximately +100\u00b0C to +120\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the presence of two amide groups in a molecule allows for extended hydrogen-bonding networks, possibly leading to a more pronounced increase in melting point. Thus, combining the contribution of two amide groups, we expect an increase of around +200\u00b0C to +240\u00b0C compared to the basic aliphatic chain.",
