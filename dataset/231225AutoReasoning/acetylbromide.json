        "Reason": "The target compound, acetyl bromide, is based on a simple ketone structure with a bromine atom substituent. The basic unit, acetone, has a melting point of -94.7\u00b0C. The addition of a bromine atom generally increases intermolecular forces due to its higher molecular weight and polarizability when compared to a methyl group. However, due to the relatively small size of the acetyl group and the polarizability of the carbonyl group, the difference in melting point is not as significant as might be expected. Furthermore, the polar and heavy bromine may cause a slight decrease due to electronic effects and destabilization of the solid phase. The opposing effects of the bromine atom result in a minimal net change. Therefore, we estimate a tiny increase to the melting point due to the bromine.",
