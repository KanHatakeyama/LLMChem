        "Reason": "The basic unit here is butanone, which has a melting point of -86\u00b0C. The presence of two additional methyl groups increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which could raise the melting point. Each methyl group in this context might approximately raise the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. However, due to the steric hindrance of the two methyl groups being on the same carbon (quaternary carbon), this increase might be somewhat mitigated to around 15\u00b0C per methyl group.",
