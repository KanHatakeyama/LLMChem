Alkanes have a predictable pattern of melting point changes based on their molecular weight and structure. n-Octane has a melting point of -56.8\u00b0C.\n\n- Chain length: Alkanes with longer chains generally have higher melting points because of increased van der Waals interactions. \n- Branching: Branched alkanes tend to have lower melting points compared to their straight-chain isomers due to a decrease in surface area, which reduces the van der Waals forces between the molecules. \n\nConsidering 4-methyloctane, which has one branch in the form of a methyl group:\n\n- Methyl group: Applying the branching effect, we expect a lower melting point compared to n-octane. The branching effect due to a methyl group can be estimated to reduce the melting point by around 20 to 30 degrees Celsius compared to the straight-chain counterpart.",

The addition of a methyl group generally introduces more branching in the molecule, which tends to disrupt the regular packing of molecules in the solid phase, thus lowering the melting point compared to the straight-chain counterpart. However, since methylation does not significantly alter molecular mass or intermolecular forces, the effect on the melting point is relatively small.

The addition of a methyl group at the 4-position introduces a branching in the molecule, which disrupts the regular packing of molecules in the solid phase, thus lowering the melting point compared to the straight-chain counterpart. Given that the actual value for the melting point of 4-methyloctane is significantly lower than the predicted range, the estimated effect of the methyl group needs to be reassessed. The actual data suggests that the introduction of branching via a methyl group has a larger impact on the melting point than initially considered. A reevaluation of the effect of the methyl group might approximate a shift of around -56 to -61\u00b0C, to be consistent with the known actual value.",
