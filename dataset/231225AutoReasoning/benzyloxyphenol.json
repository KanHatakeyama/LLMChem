        "Reason": "The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of around 41\u00b0C. Adding a benzyl group (phenylmethyl) introduces additional pi-pi interactions and van der Waals forces, which typically increases the melting point. The increment can be approximated to be around +60\u00b0C. Another phenol group adds hydrogen bonding capacity and rigidity to the molecule, which should further increase the melting point. The increment due to an additional phenol ring structure can be estimated to be around +20\u00b0C. Therefore, adding both the benzyl group and the effects of the additional phenol structure should lead to a cumulative increase.",
