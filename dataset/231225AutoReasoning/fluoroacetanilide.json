        "Reason": "The compound 2'-fluoroacetanilide consists of a benzene ring, an amide group (from acetanilide), and a fluorine substituent at the ortho position. We start with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Amides generally increase the melting point significantly due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and the resonance stabilization of the amide bond; this effect might add approximately +70\u00b0C to the base melting point. A fluorine substituent is an electron-withdrawing group that enhances intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, leading to an increment in the melting point, let's estimate this as a +10\u00b0C addition. However, the ortho substitution on the benzene typically adds steric hindrance, slightly reducing the overall symmetry and potential for packing efficiency; this might reduce the melting point by -5 to -10\u00b0C. Therefore, combining these effects, we get an approximate additive increase of 70 + 10 - 10 = +70\u00b0C.",
