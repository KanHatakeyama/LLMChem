        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is phenylacetonitrile, which has a melting point of around 71\u00b0C. Methoxy groups have a dual effect. They are electron-donating groups that can participate in resonance with the phenyl ring, which tends to stabilize the structure and increase the melting point. However, they also add steric bulk and can decrease the melting force between molecules by making the structure less planar. One methoxy group typically raises the melting point by 1-2\u00b0C. There are three methoxy groups attached to the phenyl ring, which combined could contribute to an increase of 3-6\u00b0C. The aliphatic nitrile group attached to the phenyl ring is linear and may allow for tighter packing in the crystal lattice, which tends to raise the melting point by approximately 5\u00b0C compared to benzene.",
