        "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit, benzene, which has a melting point of approximately 5.5 degrees Celsius. We will analyze the functional groups appended to the benzene ring in N-(4-carboxyphenyl)phthalimide to estimate their effects on the melting point. The phthalimide group typically raises the melting point significantly because of increased molecular weight and rigid structure as a result of the two carbonyl groups being attached to the nitrogen. This effect can be estimated at around +200 degrees. The carboxy group attached to the other benzene ring also raises the melting point due to potential hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight, contributing to a more ordered solid structure, adding roughly another +40 degrees. Another factor to consider is the two benzene rings connected through the phthalimide group and the carboxy link, which might increase the melting point through additional pi-pi interactions and molecular rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees. However, these values are just approximate and the interactions between groups can create a non-linear effect on the melting point.",

        "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit, benzene, which has a melting point of approximately 5.5\u00b0C. The phthalimide group is expected to raise the melting point significantly due to the increased molecular rigidity and the possibility of intermolecular hydrogen bonding with the presence of two carbonyl groups. This effect can be estimated at around +200\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group attached to the other benzene ring also contributes to an increased melting point due to its capacity for strong hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point, which can be quantitatively estimated as a +45\u00b0C increase. Additionally, the presence of two benzene rings connected via the phthalimide group and the carboxylic acid link enhances molecular rigidity and pi-pi interactions, which likely raises the melting point further by an estimated +40\u00b0C. After taking into account the sum of these effects quantitatively, the prediction should be adjusted to closely match the actual measured value.",
