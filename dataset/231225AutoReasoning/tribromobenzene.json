        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Each bromine substituent substantially increases the molecular weight and size, creating stronger London dispersion forces. Additionally, the symmetry of the molecule with bromines at the 1,3,5- positions enhances the efficiency of molecular packing, further raising the melting point. We estimate each bromine to raise the melting point by approximately 40 \u00b0C over benzene. Therefore, the shift for three bromine atoms would be about 120 \u00b0C.",
