        "Reason": "Basic unit, phenol has a melting point of 41\u00b0C. Adding an ethyl group (\u2013C2H4\u2013) increases the molecular weight and provides some additional van der Waals interactions, which might increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid (\u2013COOH) group forms strong hydrogen bonds, which could contribute a significant increase in melting point, possibly around 50\u00b0C, due to dimerization and the increased cohesive forces. However, the presence of the ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) between the phenol and acetic acid moiety could reduce this effect slightly since it introduces some flexibility, possibly by about -10\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C.",
