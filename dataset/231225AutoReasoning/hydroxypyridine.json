        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of around -42\u00b0C. The addition of a hydroxyl (-OH) group to the pyridine ring will generally increase the melting point due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which make the molecular structure more rigid and stable, thereby requiring more energy (heat) to change its state. A typical hydroxyl group may increase the melting point by approximately 200\u00b0C due to strong hydrogen bonding capabilities. Additionally, the hydroxyl group offers potential for increased polarity, which can also contribute to elevating the melting point.",

The addition of a hydroxyl (-OH) group to the pyridine ring will increase the melting point due to the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds significantly increase the energy required to melt a compound, and a hydroxyl group could elevate the melting point by around 140\u00b0C because of the strong hydrogen bonding it introduces. Moreover, the attachment of the -OH group to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle further increases the melting point by enhancing molecular rigidity and polarity.",
