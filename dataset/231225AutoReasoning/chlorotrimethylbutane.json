        "Reason": "The target compound, 2-chloro-2,3,3-trimethylbutane, can be broken down into a basic unit and the functional groups that modify it. The basic unit would be butane, which has a melting point of -138.3 degrees Celsius. We then consider the effects of the functional groups:\n- Methyl groups (three in total): These are alkyl groups that generally increase the melting point by adding steric bulk and increasing the van der Waals forces. Assuming each methyl group raises the melting point by 20 degrees Celsius, the combined effect of three would be +60.\n- The chloro group generally increases the melting point due to the polarizability and dipole interactions it introduces. If the chloro group contributes approximately +40 degrees Celsius to the melting point,\nTherefore, the combined contributions of three methyl groups and one chloro group is +100 degrees Celsius. When this is added to the base value for butane, we get an estimated melting point for the target compound.",
