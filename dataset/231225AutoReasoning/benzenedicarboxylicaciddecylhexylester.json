        "Reason": "The compound 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, decyl hexyl ester, also known as dioctyl phthalate, consists of a benzene ring with two ester groups. Each ester is formed from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol with long alkyl chains (hexyl and decyl). The basic benzene unit without any substituents has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the ester groups typically raises the melting point due to the addition of polar carbonyl functions. However, the long aliphatic chains tend to lower the melting point due to their flexibility and the resulting lower tendency of the molecules to stack efficiently in a solid state. In this case, the large non-polar alkyl chains have a greater effect on lowering the melting point than the polar ester groups have on raising it. Estimating the effect of the long alkyl chains, a decrease in melting point by around 10\u00b0C might be expected for each long alkyl chain. With two such alkyl chains, this results in a relatively low melting point.",
