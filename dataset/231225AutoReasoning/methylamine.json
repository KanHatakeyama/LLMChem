        "Reason": "The basic unit for methylamine is ammonia, which has a melting point of -77.7 degrees Celsius. The methyl (CH3) group generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, introducing the methyl group also increases the potential for torsional strain and reduces the hydrogen bonding potential on a per-molecule basis compared to ammonia. This is because ammonia has three hydrogen atoms capable of hydrogen bonding, whereas methylamine only has two, with the third hydrogen replaced by a methyl group. The inductive effect of the methyl group may also increase the electron density around the nitrogen, making it a slightly stronger hydrogen bond donor, but overall, methylamine has fewer sites for hydrogen bonding. The balance of these effects results in a lower melting point than ammonia. Given that a methyl group would typically add a small increase to the melting point, but the reduction in hydrogen bonding capacity and increased torsional strain lead to a larger decrease, the overall effect is a decrease in the melting point. Estimating this as a relatively small impact of about -15.7 degrees Celsius from the ammonia reference point provides an approximate value.",
