        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl (-OH) group generally has a strong hydrogen-bonding capability, which significantly increases the melting point. If we consider a similar effect as that in phenol, which has a melting point of 41\u00b0C, the hydroxyl group would contribute an increase of approximately +35.5\u00b0C. The iodine atom is a heavy substituent, which typically increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. In molecules similar to iodobenzene, the iodine contributes roughly +45\u00b0C to the melting point (iodobenzene has a melting point of about 31\u00b0C, so compared to benzene, that's an increase of +25.5\u00b0C). However, the ortho-position of the iodine relative to the hydroxyl group may cause some steric hindrance, slightly reducing the net increase caused by iodine. This steric effect might reduce the contribution of iodine by about -5\u00b0C. Adding these effects together gives us an estimated increase of +75.5\u00b0C from benzene, but with the slight deduction for steric hindrance, we might expect a melting point around +70.5\u00b0C when compared to benzene base value.",

The iodine atom, being a heavy substituent, generally increases the melting point because of increased molecular weight and stronger van der Waals interactions. The melting point increase due to iodine can be estimated using iodobenzene as a reference, which has a melting point of about 31\u00b0C, indicating that iodine contributes approximately +25.5\u00b0C. However, any steric hindrance between the iodine and the hydroxyl group, which are in the ortho position to each other, must be considered. This steric hindrance may slightly reduce the contribution from iodine, estimated to be around -5\u00b0C. The combined estimated effects without considering steric hindrance would be +61\u00b0C to benzene's melting point, but adjusting for the steric hindrance results in a net increase of +56\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The base structure of phenol has a melting point of 40.5 degrees Celsius. The iodine (I) substituent, being a large, heavy halogen, generally increases the molecular weight and tends to increase the intermolecular forces due to its polarizability, which usually raises the melting point by roughly 20 degrees Celsius. However, iodine's heavy atomic weight can also lead to destabilization of crystal lattices, potentially reducing the melting point. Since the actual melting point is relatively close to that of phenol, the exact net effect of iodine in this case seems to be minimal, thus raising the melting point only by around 1 degree Celsius.",
