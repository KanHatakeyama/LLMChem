        "Reason": "The target compound is 1-aminodecane, which is an alkane chain with an amino (NH2) group at the end. Alkanes have low melting points due to weak Van der Waals forces. Each additional carbon in the chain typically increases the melting point by a small amount because it increases the molecular weight and the surface area, thus slightly strengthening the Van der Waals forces. We start with the base value of methane, which is the smallest alkane, with a melting point of -182 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene (CH2) group within an alkane chain approximately contributes +5 degrees Celsius to the melting point. Therefore, the contribution of nine additional methylene groups to the melting point in 1-aminodecane can be estimated as 9 * 5 = 45 degrees Celsius. Additionally, primary amines typically raise the melting point due to their potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of a primary amino group can increase the melting point by about 40-50 degrees Celsius over a similar alkane without the group. Considering these factors, we will estimate the contribution of the amino group to be +45 degrees Celsius.",

        "Reason": "The compound 1-aminodecane consists of a decane backbone with an amino group at one end. The base compound methane, which is the simplest alkane, has a melting point of -182. The methylene (CH2) increment in the alkane chain typically contributes an increase in melting point due to increased molecular weight and surface area which enhances the Van der Waals forces, this increment is approximately +5 degrees Celsius for each additional CH2 group. Decane has nine more CH2 groups than methane, which gives us an increase of 9 * 5 = 45 degrees Celsius. An amino group on an alkane contributes to a higher melting point because of hydrogen bonding capabilities, and this contribution in case of primary amines can be around +50 degrees Celsius. However, the actual melting point will be less due to the compound's extended chain which results in decreased molecular packing efficiency. We assign a moderate value of +40 degrees Celsius for the amino group, taking into account that the hydrogen bonding will not fully compensate for the loose packing of the long alkane chain.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, decane, has a melting point of around -30\u00b0C. An amino group tends to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which increases the melting point by approximately 40 to 50 degrees compared to the hydrocarbon with the same carbon number. However, since the amino group is at the end of a long carbon chain in 1-aminodecane, its effect on the melting point is slightly attenuated. Therefore, the increase due to the amino group is estimated to be around 45\u00b0C.",
