        "Reason": "The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of 41\u00b0C. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as chlorine (Cl) and nitro (NO2) generally increases the melting point due to their inductive effects, which enhance intermolecular attractions. The hydroxyl group (OH) forms strong hydrogen bonds, which are already taken into account with the base phenol melting point. The chlorine substituent would typically add approximately +20\u00b0C due to its size and electronegativity, which enhances dipole interactions. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and can be expected to raise the melting point significantly, potentially by another +30\u00b0C due to strong intermolecular forces imparted by the group's polarity. However, the introduction of additional groups also results in increased steric hindrance, which tends to lower the melting point. Considering both the inductive and steric effects, the nitro group might contribute a net increase of slightly less than its full potential value.",
        "Prediction": "70\u00b0C (41\u00b0C for phenol base +20\u00b0C for Cl +9\u00b0C for the nitro group, considering steric hindrance reductions)",
