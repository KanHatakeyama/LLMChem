        "Reason": "The baseline compound for comparison will be ethyl acetate which has a melting point of \u221283.6 \u00b0C. Methyl malonamate has two primary functional changes in comparison: the additional carboxylate ester group and an amide group. Each ester group in methyl malonamate compared to the ethyl acetate represents an added carbonyl and alkoxy functionality, both of which can increase intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Esters generally raise the melting point by about +50 \u00b0C due to these interactions. However, the amide group has an even stronger effect on the melting point due to its ability to engage in hydrogen bonding. Amides typically raise the melting point by about +80 \u00b0C. Assuming the combined effects of the two esters and the amide are additive, the estimation for the shift in melting point relative to ethyl acetate would be (+50 \u00b0C * 1 for the additional ester) + (+80 \u00b0C for the amide) = +130 \u00b0C. Therefore, the predicted melting point of methyl malonamate can be calculated by taking the melting point of ethyl acetate and adding the estimated shifts due to each functional group: \u221283.6 \u00b0C + 130 \u00b0C = +46.4 \u00b0C.",
