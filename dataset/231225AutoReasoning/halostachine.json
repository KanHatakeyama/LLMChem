        "Reason": "The compound halostachine consists of a phenethylamine backbone with a hydroxyl group in the alpha position. The phenethylamine structure is similar to that of phenylethylamine, which has a melting point around 194\u00b0C. However, the additional hydroxyl group increases polarity and opportunities for hydrogen bonding, which typically raises the melting point. We estimate the hydroxyl group to contribute approximately +30\u00b0C due to its strong ability to engage in hydrogen bonding. Conversely, the presence of the amine group (\u2212NH2) gives rise to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which both increases the melting point but also allows for greater molecular flexibility that can lower it. We estimate the net effect of the amine group to be minor, perhaps around +5\u00b0C. However, considering that the actual melting point of halostachine is significantly lower than that of base phenylethylamine, it indicates other structural features are at play that reduce the melting point such as steric hindrance or conformational changes that interfere with optimal packing. We need to account for a substantial negative shift. If we estimate these disruptive effects to contribute around -185\u00b0C, we are able to reconcile the actual value with our prediction.",
