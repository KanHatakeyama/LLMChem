        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-bromo-p-xylene is benzene with a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of methyl groups generally increase the melting point due to an increase in hydrophobic interaction and Van der Waals forces, but since xylene has three isomers (ortho, meta, and para) with differing melting points, for p-xylene specifically, it has a melting point of 13 \u00b0C, so each methyl group in p-xylene contributes an increase of approximately 3.75 \u00b0C. The introduction of a bromine atom increases the molecular weight and the polarizability, which tends to raise the melting point as well, bromobenzene has a melting point of -30.8 \u00b0C; however, the combination of the electron-withdrawing bromine and the electron-donating methyl groups on the para position can also influence the crystal packing efficiency. If we attribute an approximate increase of 5 \u00b0C for the addition of a bromine atom to a xylene structure, we can estimate the shift in melting point due to this substitution, we also need to account for the potential decreased contribution of the methyl groups due to the steric hindrance imposed by the bromine, which might reduce it by 1 \u00b0C per methyl group. Combining these effects for 2-bromo-p-xylene: base value for benzene (5.5) + increase for both methyl groups (2 * 3.75) + increase for bromine (5) - steric reduction for methyl groups (2 * 1) = 16.0 \u00b0C",
