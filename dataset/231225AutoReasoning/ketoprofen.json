        "Reason": "The target compound ketoprofen has a basic phenyl ring similar to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The compound has two carboxylic acid groups, each of which typically raises the melting point due to the ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, adding approximately +80 each to the melting point. Additionally, there are two alkyl substitutions on the phenyl ring (methyl and isopropyl groups). An alkyl group typically raises the melting point as they increase the molecular weight and provide more van der Waals interactions. A methyl group might contribute around +5 to the melting point, whereas an isopropyl group, being bulkier, may add about +10. The ketone group on the secondary phenyl ring can also form dipole-dipole interactions but has a less significant effect on the melting point compared to the carboxylic acids and might contribute an estimated +5. Thus, the cumulative effect of these functional groups is considered for the prediction.",

        "Reason": "The basic structure of ketoprofen contains a benzene ring which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The melting point is significantly increased by the presence of two carboxylic acid groups capable of forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Each carboxylic acid group can be expected to increase the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups such as the methyl group and isopropyl group attached to the benzene ring add further to the melting point by increasing the van der Waals forces due to increased molecular weight and size; a methyl group might add around +5, and an isopropyl group, being larger, could add about +10.

        "Reason": "The compound (+/+)-ketoprofen has several structural features that influence its melting point. The basic structure can be considered as a biphenyl with two carboxylic acid groups and one tertiary butyl group. Biphenyl by itself has a melting point of around 70\u00b0C. First, the carboxylic acid groups normally increase the melting point due to their ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds; each might add approximately +40\u00b0C. However, due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding that could limit the overall ability to form extensive intermolecular networks, we won't use the full additive value of two carboxylic acids. Instead, we'll attribute a +60\u00b0C increase in total for both \u2013COOH groups. The tertiary butyl group adds steric bulk which may interfere with close packing and could slightly lower the melting point; we'll estimate a -5\u00b0C for this factor. Additionally, ketones typically add around +10\u00b0C due to polarized carbonyl groups that can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, but since there is also a carboxylic acid in close proximity, its effect may be somewhat reduced. We won't add any additional effect for the ketone because of the potential for internal hydrogen bonding.",

        "Reason": "The compound (+/+)-ketoprofen has several structural features that impact its melting point. The basic biphenyl structure has a melting point of about 70\u00b0C. The twin carboxylic acid groups are capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and would typically add significantly to the melting point; however, the potential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the nearby ketone group may reduce their overall impact. Conservatively, let's estimate this influence to be around +50\u00b0C combined. The tertiary butyl group generally impedes close packing of the molecules, which can lower the melting point; we can estimate a -5\u00b0C for this group. The effect of the ketone could increase the melting point by around +10\u00b0C due to dipole-dipole interactions, but since it's in close proximity to a carboxylic acid and may be involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, its contribution is likely reduced; let's conservatively estimate it contributes +5\u00b0C. Taking these modifications into account, our predicted increase over biphenyl would be +50\u00b0C from the carboxylic acids, -5\u00b0C from the tertiary butyl, and +5\u00b0C from the ketone.",

        "Reason": "The compound (+/+)-ketoprofen can be broken down in terms of its functional groups to predict its melting point. The basic structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings) which can be considered to have a base melting point akin to that of benzene. However, benzene itself is a liquid at room temperature, so we will need to instead use a biphenyl backbone which has a higher melting point due to its larger size and the increase in pi-pi interactions. Biphenyl has a melting point of around 70 degrees Celsius. This number will be adjusted for the additional functional groups. Each of the benzene rings has additional substitutions: one has a ketone (C=O), and both have a carboxylic acid group (COOH), and one has a methyl group (-CH3). The ketone groups generally increase melting point due to the polar nature of the C=O bond and potential for hydrogen bonding, this might add around +20 degrees. The carboxylic acid groups form strong hydrogen bonding and typically increase the melting point significantly due to dimerization; let's approximate this effect at +50 degrees each. The methyl group is small and will have a smaller effect on the melting point, possibly contributing around +5 degrees due to increased molecular weight and a slight increase in van der Waals interactions. Adding these contributions together gives the predicted melting point.",

Starting with the biphenyl backbone as a base unit, which has a higher melting point than benzene due to increased molecular size and pi-pi stacking, we estimate the biphenyl melting point to be around 70 degrees Celsius. To this, we add the effects of the functional groups. The ketone groups can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees each, due to the polarity of the C=O bond and the potential for interaction with other polarized groups. There are two carboxylic acid groups, which have a strong capacity for hydrogen bonding, and they can form dimers; their effect on the melting point is substantial, possibly around +50 degrees for each carboxylic acid.
