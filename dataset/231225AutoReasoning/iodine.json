        "Reason": "The basic unit for iodine is the diatomic molecule I2. The melting point is influenced by the intermolecular forces present, which in the case of I2 are primarily Van der Waals forces due to its nonpolar nature. The large electron cloud of iodine allows for significant instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions, which leads to a higher melting point. However, as a diatomic molecule, there are no additional functional groups to consider for iodine, so the melting point directly relates to these intermolecular forces.",
