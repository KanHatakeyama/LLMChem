        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is cyclohexane with a melting point of approximately 6.5 degrees Celsius. The bicyclic structure of the compound provides significant rigidity, which tends to raise the melting point due to the difficulty of disrupting the crystal lattice: +100. The additional strain from the bridgehead introduced by the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure can further raise the melting point: +20. Each carboxylic acid group, with the capability of forming strong hydrogen bonds, contributes significantly to the melting point by promoting a well-ordered crystal lattice structure: 2 groups * +30. The fact that the compound has four stereocenters adds complexity to the molecule, but as these do not directly contribute to intermolecular forces significantly in a rigid bicyclic structure, their effect is negligible for the purpose of predicting the melting point.",
