        "Reason": "The target compound is phenolphthalein, which is a large organic molecule with several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic structure can be thought to arise from biphenyl, which has a melting point around 70 degrees Celsius. Each of the following functional groups and structural features will contribute to the melting point:\n- The biphenyl core structure provides a substantial base melting point due to its planar and rigid structure which can pack efficiently in the solid state.\n- Four phenol groups (OH groups attached to benzene rings) are present, which can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, raising the melting point significantly. The contribution of an OH group to the melting point of a molecule can be around +40 to +80 degrees Celsius per group, depending on the ability of the molecule to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds.\n- The molecule contains two lactone groups (cyclic esters), which can participate in dipole-dipole interactions and also contribute to the rigidity of the molecule, further increasing the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius per group.\nFor the sake of this prediction, the sum of the effects of individual groups is considered to be additive. However, it is important to account for the fact that these group contributions could be less in a larger molecule due to steric hindrance and other factors that may inhibit optimal packing and intermolecular interactions. Thus, a conservative estimate would be applied for the contribution of each group.",
