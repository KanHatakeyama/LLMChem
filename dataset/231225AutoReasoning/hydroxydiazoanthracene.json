        "Reason": "The target compound is 1-hydroxy-5,10-diazoanthracene. The basic structure for comparison is anthracene, which has a melting point of 218\u00b0C. The influence of functional groups on the melting point of the compound needs to be considered quantitatively. The hydroxy group (-OH) typically causes hydrogen bonding which usually increases melting point, but being a single OH in a large aromatic system could reduce symmetry affecting crystal packing efficiency, so we might consider a decrease of about -20\u00b0C. Each diazo group (-N=N-) is less common and data is scarce, but it is expected to reduce the melting point due to steric hindrance and possible destabilization of crystal lattice, assessed here at -20\u00b0C per diazo group. Combining the effects quantitatively: Basic unit (anthracene) = 218\u00b0C, hydroxy group = -20\u00b0C, two diazo groups = -40\u00b0C (2 x -20\u00b0C). The predicted melting point is the sum of these effects.",
