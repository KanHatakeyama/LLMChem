        "Reason": "For p-bromobenzoic acid, the basic unit is benzene which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. When adding a carboxylic acid group, the melting point significantly increases due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the possibility of dimer formation, which can be estimated as +180 \u00b0C. The addition of a bromine atom has two effects: it increases the molecular weight, which generally results in an elevation of the melting point (estimated as +20 \u00b0C). However, it also introduces some polarity and larger surface area, which can disrupt the crystal lattice of the carboxylic dimer slightly, reducing the melting point (-5 \u00b0C). Combining these effects predicts an increased melting point for p-bromobenzoic acid relative to benzene.",

        "Reason": "For p-bromobenzoic acid, the basic unit is benzene which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group greatly increases the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and the potential for dimerization, typically contributing to an increase of +200 \u00b0C due to the significantly enhanced intermolecular interactions compared to benzene alone. The bromine substituent on the benzene ring further increases the melting point, primarily due to increases in molecular weight and intermolecular forces such as van der Waals forces; this can be estimated as an additional +40 \u00b0C. However, the introduction of bromine may cause some disruption to the crystal lattice due to its size and polarity, but this effect is relatively minor, estimated at a -5 \u00b0C reduction in melting point. The combined effects of these functional groups lead to a higher melting point for p-bromobenzoic acid in comparison to benzene.",

        "Reason": "The compound p-bromobenzoic acid is composed of a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group and a bromine atom as substituents. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group forms strong hydrogen bonds, significantly raising the melting point. This effect typically adds around +190\u00b0C to the melting point of the molecule. The bromine atom is a heavy and polarizable substituent, which also increases the melting point through enhanced van der Waals interactions; this can contribute an additional +40 to +60\u00b0C.
