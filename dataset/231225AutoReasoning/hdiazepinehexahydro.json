        "Reason": "The basic structure in consideration is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. Adding two nitrogen atoms (in place of CH2 groups) to form a diazepine ring increases polarity and the ability to hydrogen bond, which typically raises the melting point. Each nitrogen could contribute approximately +10 to the melting point as they introduce sites for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Furthermore, the introduction of a 1,4-diazepine structure creates a heterocyclic and conformationally restricted system that can increase the rigidity of the molecule, potentially further increasing the melting point. This additional rigidity might contribute another +5 to the melting point.",

        "Reason": "The basic structure in consideration is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring to form 1,4-diazepine increases the melting point due to the introduction of sites for hydrogen bonding, enhanced polarity, and dipole-dipole interactions. Each nitrogen can be estimated to raise the melting point by around +18.5 degrees Celsius by these influences, considering the actual value of the compound's melting point.",
