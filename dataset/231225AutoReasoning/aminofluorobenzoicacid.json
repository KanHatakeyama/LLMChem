        "Reason": "The compound 4-amino-2-fluorobenzoic acid consists of three functional groups attached to a benzene ring which influence its melting point: the amino group (-NH2), the fluorine atom, and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Each of these will contribute differently. \n- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Amino group: Raises melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding potential, estimated increase +80\u00b0C. \n- Fluorine atom: Slightly raises the melting point due to the inductive effect, which increases the polarity, estimated increase +20\u00b0C. \n- Carboxylic acid group: Significantly raises melting point because of strong hydrogen bonding, dimerization in solid state, estimated increase +100\u00b0C. \nCombining these effects results in an additive increase in melting point based on the individual contributions of the substituents.",
