Adding two methyl groups should increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each methyl group typically adds about +5 to the melting point. The carbonyl (-C=O) group will increase the melting point even more due to its ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions; a rough estimate for this effect is about +80 to the melting point.",

Adding two methyl groups should increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each methyl group typically adds about +5 to the melting point. The carbonyl (-C=O) group will increase the melting point significantly due to its ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which is much stronger than the previous interactions.
