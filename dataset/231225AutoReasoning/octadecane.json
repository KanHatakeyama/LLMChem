        "Reason": "The basic unit methane has a boiling point of -161.5\u00b0C. Each additional methylene group (CH2) in a saturated hydrocarbon chain tends to increase the boiling point. For long-chained alkanes, the increase is approximately 20-30\u00b0C for each methylene group added due to the increase in van der Waals forces as the chain length increases. However, after a certain chain length, the boiling point increases per CH2 group will not maintain this value and becomes lower. Octadecane is a long alkane chain with 17 additional methylene groups compared to methane. We would expect the additional CH2 groups to add approximately 2-3\u00b0C per group for such a long alkane.",
