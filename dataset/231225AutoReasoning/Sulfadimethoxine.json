        "Reason": "The base structure for sulfadimethoxine is an aromatic amine, aniline, which has a melting point of around 6 degrees Celsius. Sulfadimethoxine however includes additional functional groups and structural modifications that affect its melting point: - Two methoxy groups, which are electron-donating and slightly increase the melting point due to additional van der Waals forces; each methoxy may add about +15 degrees Celsius. - A sulfonamide group, which greatly increases the melting point because of the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the polar nature of the SO2 group; this could add approximately +100 degrees Celsius. - An additional aromatic ring also contributes to an increased melting point through added pi-pi interactions and increased molecular complexity; this might add +50 degrees Celsius. - Collectively, these additions have the effect of greatly increasing the melting point over the very low base value for aniline.",
