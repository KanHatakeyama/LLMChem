        "Reason": "For 2,3-dibromo-2-methyl-butane, we start by understanding the melting point of butane, which is around -138.4 degrees Celsius. Let's analyze the effect of functional groups on the melting point: \n- Bromine atoms: Each bromine adds significant weight and also allows for better solid packing. We can estimate that each bromo group increases the melting point by about 100 degrees Celsius due to the increased Van der Waals forces and potential dipole-dipole interactions. With two bromo groups, we can estimate an increase of about 200 degrees Celsius. \n- Methyl group: The addition of a methyl group normally raises the melting point as it increases molecular weight and provides more surface area for Van der Waals interactions. Let's estimate the addition of a methyl group to add about 20 degrees Celsius. \nCombining these adjustments and starting with the base melting point of butane, we can predict the melting point of 2,3-dibromo-2-methyl-butane.",

        "Reason": "Starting with butane, which melts around -138.4\u00b0C, the addition of functional groups alters its melting point. Each bromine atom contributes heavily to the melting point due to its significant atomic weight and the enhancement of Van der Waals forces and potential dipole-dipole interactions. However, given the actual melting value is 7.0\u00b0C, the initial estimation of a 100\u00b0C increase per bromine atom is overestimated. A more reasonable prediction would approximate less drastic increase per bromine atom. If each bromine contributes an increase of approximately 70\u00b0C due to these interactions, that would add 140\u00b0C for two bromo groups. The methyl group, on the other hand, adds steric bulk and increases the Van der Waals forces, but its effect is smaller than that of bromine; it would likely raise the melting point by approximately 5\u00b0C rather than the previously estimated 20\u00b0C. Accordingly, starting from butane's melting point and adding the contributions of the bromine and methyl groups, we can predict the melting point of 2,3-dibromo-2-methyl-butane.",
