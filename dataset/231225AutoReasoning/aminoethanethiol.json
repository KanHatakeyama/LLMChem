        "Reason": "The basic structural unit for 2-aminoethanethiol is ethane, which has a melting point of -172. The amino (NH2) group is expected to raise the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities (+100). Additionally, the thiol (SH) group will also contribute to an increase in melting point due to its polar nature and ability to hydrogen bond, albeit weaker than amines (+70). Therefore, we can add these effects to the base melting point of ethane.",
