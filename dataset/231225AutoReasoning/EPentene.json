        "Reason": "The base compound ethene has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The added carbon chain increases the molecular weight and Van der Waals forces, thus generally raising the melting point. Each additional methylene (CH2) group in a linear alkane can raise the melting point by about 20 degrees Celsius, but for alkenes, the effect is slightly less due to less effective packing caused by the double bond. In (2E)-Pent-2-ene, there are three additional CH2 groups compared to ethene, and we predict a smaller increment due to the double bond. Therefore, each added methylene group might contribute an estimated 15 degrees Celsius increase over the base melting point. The presence of the double bond in (2E)-Pent-2-ene also means the molecule is not as flexible as an alkane, which might slightly lower the melting point effect compared to a straight chain alkane with the same number of carbon atoms. However, this effect is minimal in the liquid state and more pronounced in the solid state, so for the melting point, the double bond's presence is likely to have an effect but not as large as it would for the boiling point.",

Each additional methylene group in a linear alkane increases the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to an increase in van der Waals forces. Since there are three additional methylene groups from ethene to pent-2-ene, we add +15\u00b0C. Furthermore, the presence of a double bond typically slightly lowers the melting point compared to a saturated alkane due to less effective packing caused by the geometry of the double bond, which could be estimated as a -5\u00b0C change. Combining these effects, we expect an increase of +10\u00b0C from the base ethene structure.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for (2E)-Pent-2-ene is ethene, which has a melting point of -169\u00b0C. For each additional methylene CH2 group in a straight-chain hydrocarbon, the melting point typically increases by about +5\u00b0C due to the increase in van der Waals forces resulting from the increased molecular size. Given that (2E)-Pent-2-ene has three more CH2 groups than ethene, we initially predict an increase of +15\u00b0C. However, the presence of the double bond in (2E)-Pent-2-ene, as opposed to a single bond in a saturated alkane, generally reduces the melting point slightly due to the kinked geometry that disrupts tight packing. This reduction can be approximated to -5\u00b0C. The combination of these contributions results in a net increase of +10\u00b0C from the melting point of ethene. Therefore, we predict a melting point of -159\u00b0C for (2E)-Pent-2-ene.",

        "Reason": "The base molecule to consider can be ethane, which has a melting point of -183 degrees Celsius. The addition of double bonds (alkene functional group) generally reduces the melting point because double bonds cause a kink in the molecular shape, which leads to a less tightly packed structure and lower van der Waals interactions compared to saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes). Each extra CH2 group in a linear alkane raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and surface area, which enhances the van der Waals forces. Ethene, as a base for alkenes with one double bond, melts at -169 degrees Celsius, showing the decrease compared to ethane because of the double bond effect. In (2E)-Pent-2-ene, there are additional 3 CH2 groups compared to ethene, each contributing approximately +5 degrees to the melting point, based on the incremental increase seen in linear alkanes. Hence, we should add 3*5=15 degrees to the melting point of ethene.",

        "Reason": "The base molecule to consider can be ethene, which has a melting point of -169 degrees Celsius. Adding alkyl groups (each additional CH2 unit in an alkane chain) tends to increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and surface area, enhancing van der Waals forces. For alkanes, each CH2 group typically contributes about +5 degrees Celsius to the melting point. However, (2E)-Pent-2-ene is an alkene and the presence of a double bond slightly lowers the melting point due to less effective packing compared to alkanes, although this effect is less pronounced as the chain lengthens. In (2E)-Pent-2-ene, there are three additional CH2 groups compared to ethene. Thus, the addition of these CH2 groups would contribute +15 degrees Celsius (3 * +5 degrees) to the melting point of ethene. This adjustment suggests that the double bond reduces the melting point by enough to offset the increase due to the added CH2 groups. Therefore, we must account for both the decrease due to the double bond and the increase due to the added CH2 units.",
