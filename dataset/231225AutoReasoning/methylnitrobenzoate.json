        "Reason": "The compound methyl 2-nitrobenzoate consists of a benzene ring, an ester group (COOCH3), and a nitro group (NO2). The benzene ring serves as the base structure and has a typical melting point around 5.5 \u00b0C for the closest common compound, benzene. The ester group is generally electron-withdrawing and can increase the polarity of the molecule, which often leads to higher melting points due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions. We can estimate this effect to increase the melting point by about +50 to +90 \u00b0C. The nitro group is also an electron-withdrawing group and can contribute to stronger intermolecular forces, possibly increasing the melting point by +30 to +50 \u00b0C. However, the presence of the ester group adjacent to the nitro group can create steric hindrance and decrease the symmetry of the molecule, potentially reducing the melting point slightly due to a less efficient packing in the solid state. This reduction might be in the order of -10 to -20 \u00b0C. Therefore, the predicted melting point would be the sum of these effects taking benzene as a reference.",
