Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon composed of four fused rings, making it a much larger molecule with a higher surface area and greater van der Waals forces. Each additional fused aromatic ring significantly increases the melting point due to greater pi-pi stacking interactions and molecular rigidity. Estimating the effect of each additional fused ring to be +60-80\u00b0C (typical for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), dibenzo[a,h]anthracene with three additional rings would increase the melting point by approximately 180-240\u00b0C from the benzene baseline.",

The increment in melting point due to fusion of each aromatic ring can be estimated around +60-80\u00b0C, a typical range for such compounds. Given that dibenzo[a,h]anthracene has three additional rings compared to benzene, we can calculate the increase in melting point as 3 rings \u00d7 (60 to 80\u00b0C/ring) = +180 to +240\u00b0C.",

Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene consists of four fused benzene rings, substantially increasing the planarity and rigidity of the molecule which significantly raises the melting point. In general, each additional fused benzene ring increases the melting point by about 100\u00b0C due to increased \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and molecular weight. However, the effect gets smaller with each additional ring because the absolute increase in these interactions decreases. The first fused benzene adds about 100\u00b0C, the second adds around 90\u00b0C, and the third approximately 80\u00b0C.",
