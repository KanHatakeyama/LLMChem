        "Reason": "The basic structure to consider is pyridine, which has a melting point of -42\u00b0C. The 2,8-diphenyl substitution involves adding phenyl groups to the pyridine ring, which significantly increases molecular weight and rigidity. Each phenyl group would also contribute to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, further raising the melting point. Phenyl groups typically add quite a bit due to their rigidity and interactions, so adding two might be estimated to increase the melting point by about 110-130\u00b0C each. The pyridoquinoline structure contributes additional aromaticity and nitrogen atoms, which would further raise the melting point by perhaps another 30-50\u00b0C due to the increased molecular complexity and potential for additional hydrogen bonding.",
