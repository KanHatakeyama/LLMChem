        "Reason": "The basic unit for the compound 2-cyano-4'-methylbiphenyl is biphenyl, which has a melting point of approximately 70\u00b0C. Adding a methyl group typically raises the melting point because it increases the molecular weight and provides additional van der Waals forces; this may add about +5\u00b0C. However, introducing a cyano group (-C\u2261N) into the compound tends to lower the melting point because it is a linear, electronegative group that can disrupt the regular packing of the molecules, resulting in weaker intermolecular forces in certain crystal lattices. The effect of a cyano group may subtract roughly -24\u00b0C. So, the net change would be (-24) + 5 = -19\u00b0C.",
