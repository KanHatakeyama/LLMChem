        "Reason": "The base molecule for comparison will be uridine, which has a reported melting point range around 165\u00b0C. The isopropylidene group, which is a 5-membered ring connecting the 2' and 3' positions on the sugar moiety of uridine, generally increases steric hindrance and molecular complexity. This is likely to increase the melting point. It's a relatively bulky group and would increase the intermolecular interactions due to larger surface area, leading to higher melting point: +5. However, it's not a large increase because the flexibility of the five-membered ring partially offsets the rigidity that typically contributes to a higher melting point. The Predicted value takes into account mainly the effect of the isopropylidene group as there are no other functional group modifications relative to uridine.",
