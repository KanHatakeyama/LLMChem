        "Reason": "Benzene, as an aromatic hydrocarbon with a ring of six carbon atoms connected by alternating single and double bonds, has a melting point of 5.5 due to its symmetric and planar structure facilitating tight molecular packing in the solid state. There are no additional functional groups to alter this value.",
