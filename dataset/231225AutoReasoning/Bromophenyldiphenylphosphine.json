        "Reason": "The base structure for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group adds structural rigidity and pi-pi stacking ability that generally raises the melting point; this effect can be estimated to add approximately 25 degrees Celsius for each additional phenyl ring. Thus, two additional phenyl rings should add approximately 50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the phosphine (PH) group creates steric hindrance and polarizability, which can contribute to higher melting points; this is estimated to add around 40 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom adds significant mass and also may participate in intermolecular interactions like halogen bonding. This is estimated to increase the melting point by a further 20 degrees Celsius. The total estimated increase is 110 degrees Celsius.",
