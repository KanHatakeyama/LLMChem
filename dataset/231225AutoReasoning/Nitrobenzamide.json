        "Reason": "The compound 4-Nitrobenzamide is composed of a benzene ring, an amide group, and a nitro group. Each of these components influences the melting point in the following ways:\n- Benzene ring: provides a basic structure and has a relatively high degree of symmetry, which generally leads to a higher melting point.\n- Amide group (CONH2): increases the melting point significantly due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization of the amide bond (+80).\n- Nitro group (NO2): is a strong electron-withdrawing group that increases intermolecular forces, thereby raising the melting point (+50).\nThe predicted melting point is expected to be the sum of the base value for benzene and the incremental increases due to the functional groups.",

        "Reason": "The compound 4-Nitrobenzamide has several functional groups that contribute to its melting point. The benzene ring provides a base structure which contributes to higher melting and boiling points due to its planar and symmetrical structure. The amide group is capable of strong hydrogen bonding and adds significant rigidity to the molecule, raising the melting point. A single amide group typically contributes an increase of approximately +80 degrees Celsius due to these effects. The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and its presence increases the polarity and intermolecular forces within the compound, hence raising the melting point; it can be estimated to contribute around +50 degrees Celsius to the melting point. Combining these effects, we calculate the predicted melting point as follows.",
        "Prediction": "Benzene base value (not directly applicable as we must consider the intact 4-Nitrobenzamide molecule): 5.5 (its actual melting point for simple benzene, not a direct addend) + Amide group: +80 + Nitro group: +50 = Incorrect predicted value as the actual value is known to be 202.5. A recalculation is required taking into account the cumulative effects of the functional groups and their influence on the benzene ring in the specific molecular structure of 4-Nitrobenzamide.",
