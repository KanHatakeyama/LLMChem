        "Reason": "1,3-diaminopropane has an actual melting point of around -60 degrees Celsius. Each primary amine group (-NH2) raises the melting point because it can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases intermolecular forces and hence raises the melting point. The primary amine group attached directly to a carbon chain can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. Since there are three such groups in the compound, the total adjustment from the base structure (assuming a similar base structure as 1,3-diaminopropane) would be +90 (3 groups * +30). Therefore, starting from the base melting point of -60, an increase of +90 would predict a melting point of +30 degrees Celsius. However, the presence of these multiple amine groups also increases the possibility of internal hydrogen bonding, which can reduce the efficacy of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thus lowering the melting point slightly. Taking into account this effect, we might adjust our value down by several degrees to reach the actual melting point.",
