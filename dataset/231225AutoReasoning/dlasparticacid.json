        "Reason": "The compound dl-aspartic acid has 2 carboxyl groups and one amine group attached to a central carbon. The basic unit we can consider for comparison is acetic acid, which has a melting point of 16 degrees Celsius. Each carboxyl group forms strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which typically raise the melting point significantly. The presence of an amino group can also increase the melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding. However, the amine group also introduces a possibility of zwitterionic form at certain pH levels which might cause an additional increase in melting point due to ionic interactions. Given the cumulative effects of these functional groups, we can estimate each carboxyl group to add about 100-130 degrees Celsius due to extensive hydrogen bonding and dimerization capability, and the amine group to add about 30-50 degrees Celsius due to hydrogen bonding and zwitterion formation.",

Each additional carboxyl group can substantially increase the melting point due to the strong hydrogen bonding and possible formation of dimers. Such groups are estimated to individually add about 120 to 150 degrees Celsius.

        "Reason": "The starting point for estimating the melting point of dl-aspartic acid is to consider a similar compound with a common feature. A comparable compound is acetic acid, which has a melting point of 16.6\u00b0C. Acetic acid has two carbon atoms and a carboxylic acid group, just like aspartic acid. However, dl-aspartic acid has additional functional groups and structural features that lead to a higher melting point than acetic acid. First, dl-aspartic acid has an extra carboxylic acid group, which will significantly increase the melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding, possibly around +160 for each extra COOH (strong intermolecular forces). Second, it has an amine group, which can also engage in hydrogen bonding, likely adding an additional +40. Therefore, we have a starting point of 16.6, then adding the extra contributions: acetic acid (16.6) + first carboxylic acid group (+160) + second carboxylic acid group (+160) + amine group (+40).",

        "Reason": "The melting point of dl-aspartic acid can be predicted by first considering a simpler molecule with similar functionalities as a baseline. For example, we can take glycine, which is the simplest amino acid, with a melting point of around 233\u00b0C. Glycine has both a carboxyl (COOH) and an amino (NH2) group. dl-Aspartic acid, compared to glycine, has one additional carboxyl group, which will significantly increase the melting point due to the capability of forming more hydrogen bonds. The extra COOH group can be expected to add substantially to the melting point, estimated to be around +40\u00b0C. We also need to account for the relatively larger molecular weight of aspartic acid, which could add another few degrees; let's estimate a conservative +2\u00b0C increment. So, starting with glycine's melting point (233\u00b0C) and adding the contributions for the additional carboxyl group (+40) and the slight increase for molecular weight (+2), we arrive at a prediction.",
