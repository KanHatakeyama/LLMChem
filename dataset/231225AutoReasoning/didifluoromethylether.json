        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of di(difluoromethyl) ether, we need to consider the effects of each functional group on the basic structure. The base molecule in this case is dimethyl ether with a melting point of -138.5 C. The difluoromethyl groups each add electronegative fluorine atoms which due to strong dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding with traces of moisture will increase the melting point relative to dimethyl ether. Each -CF2H group, replacing a -CH3 group, contributes positively to the melting point due to increased polarizability and mass, as well as stronger dipole-dipole interactions afforded by the fluorine atoms. We can estimate this effect is around +8 C per difluoromethyl group compared to a methyl group.",
