The addition of the benzotriazole heterocyclic ring, which includes nitrogen atoms, generally increases the melting point due to the following reasons: (i) The nitrogen atoms in the heterocycle contribute to an increase in the melting point due to their ability to participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, adding stability to the crystal lattice (+40 \u00b0C for the three nitrogens and the fact they can participate in hydrogen bonding). (ii) The ring fusion of benzene with the 1,2,3-triazole results in a more rigid structure, which usually leads to an increased melting point due to restricted molecular motion (+10 \u00b0C for ring fusion).",

These nitrogen atoms can form a stable ring system that increases the rigidity of the structure and its lattice energy (+20 \u00b0C per nitrogen for the three nitrogens and hydrogen bonding capabilities). (ii) The ring fusion of benzene with the 1,2,3-triazole results in a more rigid structure, which typically leads to a higher melting point due to restricted molecular motion within the crystal lattice (+10 \u00b0C for the ring fusion).
