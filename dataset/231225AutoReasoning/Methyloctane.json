        "Reason": "Starting with octane as the base structure, which has a melting point of about -57 degrees Celsius, the 2-methyl group introduces steric hindrance and increases the molecular weight that could raise the melting point slightly. However, since the methyl group creates a more branched structure, it may decrease the ability for the molecules to pack efficiently in a solid state, which often lowers the melting point. The combined effect of increased molecular weight and branching tends to lower the melting point for branched alkanes compared to their straight-chain isomers. The effect of a methyl branch, in general, can lower the melting point by around 20 to 30 degrees Celsius.",
