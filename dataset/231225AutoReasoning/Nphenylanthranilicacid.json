        "Reason": "The compound N-phenylanthranilic acid has several functional groups that influence its melting point: a benzene ring, an amide group (the N-C(=O)- bond), and a carboxylic acid group. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Introducing the amide linkage (N-substitution on the benzene ring) would typically raise the melting point due to enhanced hydrogen bonding capabilities and increased molecular rigidity (+80 \u00b0C). The carboxylic acid group contributes to further intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point (+100 \u00b0C). These functional groups act together to increase melting point through the enhancement of intermolecular forces (especially hydrogen bonding) and molecular rigidity.",
