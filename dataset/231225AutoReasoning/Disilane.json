        "Reason": "- Basic unit, silane (SiH4) has a melting point of -185.0\u00b0C.\n- Each additional silicon atom in disilane adds to the molecular weight and the van der Waals forces, making the molecule more difficult to melt compared to silane. The effect of adding another silicon atom with its hydrogen atoms would increase the melting point by approximately +52.4\u00b0C compared to silane.\n",
