        "Reason": "The target compound has several functional groups that need to be considered, and the comparison will be made with aniline which has a known melting point around 53 degrees Celsius for its similar core phenylamine structure: 1) The tetrahydroquinoline group includes a heterocyclic amine with electrons delocalized over the system which generally increases melting point due to enhanced pi-pi stacking and stronger intermolecular forces, let's approximate this increase to be +30; 2) The alkyl substituent (-C) adjacent to the hydrazinecarboxamide might add some steric bulk and slightly more molecular weight, let's add +5 for this group; 3) The presence of a hydrazinecarboxamide which can participate in hydrogen bonding and shows resonance stabilization is likely to significantly increase the melting point, estimated at +40; 4) However, we have a butylene linker (-CCCC-) that adds flexibility to the molecule, which generally lowers the melting point as it disrupts crystal lattice formation. The impact can be moderate, let's subtract -10 for this. By adding these adjustments cumulatively to the base of aniline's melting point, we can predict the melting point for the target compound.",
