        "Reason": "The target compound, 17a-Ethynylestradiol, has several functional groups affecting its melting point. The basic unit we can compare to is estradiol, which has a melting point of around 178 degrees Celsius. The structural differences that we must consider are: the ethynyl group (-C\u2261CH), which generally increases melting point due to increased rigidity and polarization; additional ring strain due to the ethynyl attachment; the methyl group on the third carbon, which adds to the molecular weight and also slightly increases melting point. However, as the ethynyl attachment is making the entire structure more rigid, it has a larger impact on increasing the melting point than the methyl group.\n- Estradiol base unit: 178\n- Ethynyl group: +10 (increased rigidity and molecular weight)\n- Ring strain: +5 (additional strain from the ethynyl attachment and angular deformation)\n- Methyl group: +3 (increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces)\n- Predicted change: +(10+5+3) = +18\n",
