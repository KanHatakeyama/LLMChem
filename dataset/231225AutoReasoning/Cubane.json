        "Reason": "The basic unit of cyclohexane has a melting point of 6.5 \u00baC. Cubane is a highly strained cage-like molecule where each carbon atom is a vertex of a cube, so it deviates significantly from the ideal tetrahedral angle of sp3 hybridized carbons. This results in a high ring strain, which increases the melting point significantly. The effect of the cubic structure and high angle strain likely contributes around +119 \u00baC to the melting point.",
