        "Reason": "The base unit for this comparison is ethane, which has a melting point of -181\u00b0C. Glutaronitrile is a five-carbon chain compound, but instead of having single bonds throughout as in n-pentane (melting point -130\u00b0C), it has two cyano groups (-C\u2261N) attached to the terminal carbons. Each cyano group significantly increases the molecular dipole moment, leading to stronger dipole-dipole interactions, consequently raising the melting point. A single cyano group raises the melting point by approximately +100\u00b0C compared to a similar-sized alkane. Glutaronitrile has two cyano groups, which should result in a much higher melting point than n-pentane, but due to the linear structure and the triple bonds that reduce the compound's flexibility and polarizability, we do not simply double the effect of one cyano group. We consider the overall molecular structure effect and symmetry resulting in a lower increase. The difference in melting point from n-pentane to glutaronitrile with two cyano groups is going to be significant but not additive (+100\u00b0C for each), we predict it will be about +101\u00b0C from n-pentane, taking the interactions and structure into consideration.",
