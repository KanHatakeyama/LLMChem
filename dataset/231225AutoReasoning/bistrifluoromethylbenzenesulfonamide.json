        "Reason": "The predicted melting point for 2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenesulfonamide requires considering the effects of multiple substituents on the benzene ring:\n\n- Base unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.\n- Trifluoromethyl groups: There are two of them, and they are electron-withdrawing due to the electronegative fluorine atoms, additionally the bulky size of the CF3 groups tends to increase the melting point. Assuming each CF3 adds about +20\u00b0C due to these factors.\n- Sulfonamide group (-S(=O)2NH2): This is a polar, hydrogen-bonding-capable group, which significantly increases the melting point. We can estimate this effect to be around +100\u00b0C due to its ability to form a solid network through hydrogen bonds.\n\nTo find the overall predicted melting point, we add the effects of each group to the base value for benzene:\n\nBase benzene: 5.5\u00b0C\nTrifluoromethyl groups: 2 x (+20\u00b0C)\nSulfonamide group: +100\u00b0C\n\nAs a result, the predicted melting point is 5.5 + 40 + 100 = 145.5\u00b0C",
