        "Reason": "The basic structure to consider here is n-octadecane, which is a long-chain hydrocarbon with 18 carbon atoms. The melting point of n-octadecane is 28.2\u00b0C. Adding an amino group (-NH2) to the end of the chain to form 1-octadecylamine will influence the melting point due to the introduction of hydrogen bonding capabilities. Hydrogen bonding generally increases the melting point because molecules can form stronger intermolecular forces, resulting in a higher amount of energy needed to disrupt these interactions and melt the solid. Given the significant increase in melting point caused by the introduction of an amine group in other aliphatic amines, we can estimate this influence to be approximately +25\u00b0C for the molecule in question.",
