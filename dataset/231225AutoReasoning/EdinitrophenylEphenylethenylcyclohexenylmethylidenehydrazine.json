However, an increase of +80 \u00b0C per nitro group is too high considering their relative contribution. More realistic estimation for each nitro group would be around +40 \u00b0C. \n2. Alkene groups: Alkenes, especially styrenic (phenyl-substituted) ones, can add some rigidity to the molecule due to conjugation with aromatic rings, which may slightly increase the melting point. The effect can be estimated more realistically around +5 \u00b0C per styrenic alkene. \n3. Hydrazine derivative: Hydrazine derivatives can engage in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the crystalline lattice. However, an increase of +30 \u00b0C may be overestimated. Considering the molecular context and the relative effect of hydrogen bonding in this structure, the estimated increase should be around +10 \u00b0C. \n4.

Starting with the base unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, the different substituent effects can be considered. The dinitrophenyl group introduces strong intermolecular forces, primarily due to its capacity for hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro groups, which can raise the melting point significantly. Estimating the increase due to the dinitrophenyl group at about +100 degrees Celsius reflects these strong interactions. The styryl group, containing a vinyl linkage to a phenyl ring, adds to the molecular rigidity and slightly increases molecular weight, contributing approximately +20 degrees to the melting point. Another phenyl ring contributes to the melting point through pi-pi interaction and additional molecular weight, estimated at around +15 degrees increase. Lastly, the hydrazone moiety is capable of hydrogen bonding, further contributing to increased melting point by roughly +30 degrees Celsius. Total estimated increase based on these functional groups is 165 degrees Celsius.",

Each nitro group on the phenyl ring is known to increase the melting point significantly due to its electron-withdrawing nature and the ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds; let's estimate this as +80\u00b0C per nitro group. The additional phenyl ring connected through a vinyl group could add around +30\u00b0C due to increased pi-stacking interactions and molecular weight. The enylcyclohexyl group adds rigidity and more pi-electrons, which could further increase the melting point by +50\u00b0C due to enhanced intermolecular forces.
