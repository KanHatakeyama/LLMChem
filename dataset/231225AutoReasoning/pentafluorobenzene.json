        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Each fluorine atom, being highly electronegative, induces a strong dipole and thus increases intermolecular forces (such as dipole-dipole interactions), which generally leads to an increase in melting point. However, the symmetry of pentafluorobenzene and the electronegativity of fluorine likely leads to quite an even distribution of electron density, which would lead to a not as large as expected increase in the melting point due to strong intermolecular forces being partly counterbalanced by symmetry. Hence, the effect of each fluorine might not be additive but somewhat less effective due to the overall symmetry. Approximating the effect of each fluorine to be around -10.5\u00b0C (taking into account the increase in intermolecular forces but moderated by the symmetrical distribution of the fluorine atoms).",
