        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is propane, which has a melting point of -188\u00b0C. The presence of iodine atoms significantly increases the molecular weight and also increasingly polarizes the compound, contributing to stronger intermolecular forces. Each iodine atom is estimated to raise the melting point significantly. Although precise numerical contributions of each iodine are not easily determined without empirical data, a rough estimate could be +80 to +100 degrees per iodine atom due to the substantially increased London dispersion forces and possible dipole interactions.",
