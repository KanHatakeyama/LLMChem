        "Reason": "The basic unit, ethane, has a melting point of -183.0 \u00b0C. The introduction of each halogen typically raises the melting point because of increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces such as London dispersion forces and, in the case of bromine, dipole-dipole interactions. A bromine atom should have a large effect due to its significant size and electronegativity, potentially raising the melting point by roughly +75\u00b0C per bromine atom. Each fluorine atom is smaller than bromine and would have a lesser effect, estimated at around +10\u00b0C per fluorine atom. So, \u0394T_bromine = +75\u00b0C, \u0394T_fluorine(each) = +10\u00b0C.",

Bromine is a large, heavy atom that increases the polarizability and molecular weight, so it raises the melting point significantly. A bromine substituent can increase the melting point by roughly +60 to +80 degrees. On the other hand, fluorine atoms are highly electronegative; they increase the polarity of the molecule which can lead to stronger dipole-dipole interactions, but they are also smaller than bromine and thus have less of an effect on the melting point. Each fluorine might raise the melting point by approximately +5 to +10 degrees. Considering there are two fluorine atoms, their combined effect might be around +10 to +20 degrees.",
