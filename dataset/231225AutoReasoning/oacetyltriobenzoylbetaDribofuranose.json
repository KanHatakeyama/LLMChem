        "Reason": "The base unit for the compound is ribofuranose, which has a melting point around 88-89\u00b0C. Adding acetyl (-OC(=O)CH3) and benzoyl (-OC(=O)C6H5) groups can significantly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity, as well as potential for additional intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Each acetyl group might add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point. We have one acetyl group. The benzoyl groups are larger and more significant in raising the melting point due to their ability to engage in pi-pi stacking and dipole interactions, so each benzoyl group might add approximately +30\u00b0C. We have three benzoyl groups. So, the total predicted increase would be around 1x20\u00b0C for the acetyl and 3x30\u00b0C for the benzoyl groups, totalling an increase of 110\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The base unit for the compound is ribofuranose, which has a melting point around 88-89\u00b0C. Adding an acetyl group typically increases the melting point by introducing additional possibilities for hydrogen bonding as well as slightly increasing the molecular weight and steric hindrance. This contribution might be about +20\u00b0C for an acetyl group. There are three benzoyl groups present in the molecule. Benzoyl groups significantly increase the melting point due to the aromatic ring's ability to engage in pi-pi stacking interactions, as well as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The contribution of each benzoyl group might be around +10\u00b0C. Therefore, the combined effect of one acetyl group and three benzoyl groups should be 1x20\u00b0C + 3x10\u00b0C = 50\u00b0C added to the base melting point of ribofuranose.",
