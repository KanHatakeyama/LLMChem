        "Reason": "The compound N-boc-L-norvaline has several functional groups that can affect its melting point. Starting from a reference amino acid such as norvaline, which has a melting point in the range of 300\u00b0C, we will consider the effects of the following functional groups: \n\n- Carboxylic group (-COOH): This group typically increases the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. In norvaline, however, this group is present in its inherent structure. \n- Amino group (-NH2): Similarly, the amino group is part of the basic amino acid structure and contributes to the melting point through hydrogen bonding and zwitterion formation at physiological pH. \n- Tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group: The introduction of this bulky, nonpolar protecting group generally reduces the melting point relative to the parent amino acid due to steric hindrance that can disrupt crystal lattice formation, which typically lowers the melting point significantly. A rough estimate for such a large group could be in the range of -200 to -260\u00b0C from the original amino acid's melting point. \n\nTaking into account the Boc group's large steric effect, we estimate a large decrease in melting point.",
        "Prediction": "For N-boc-L-norvaline, with a base structure as norvaline around 300\u00b0C and considering the significant lowering effect of about -250\u00b0C due to the Boc group, we predict a melting point of approximately 50\u00b0C (300 - 250).",
