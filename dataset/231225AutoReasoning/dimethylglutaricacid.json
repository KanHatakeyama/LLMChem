        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison will be glutaric acid, which has a melting point of approximately 98 \u00b0C. The introduction of two methyl groups in the 2,2 position of the glutaric acid structure can influence the melting point in several ways. Each methyl group can increase the molecular weight and size, which could potentially increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions. However, the introduction of these bulky methyl groups can also lead to increased steric hindrance and a more asymmetrical molecule, which might disrupt the crystal packing and lead to a lower melting point. In general, branching tends to lower the melting point in comparison to straight-chain isomers due to worse packing efficiency in the solid state. The effect of each methyl group in this case can be estimated at around -7\u00b0C considering the disruption of packing. Thus, the effect of two methyl groups would be -14\u00b0C from the parent compound of glutaric acid.",
