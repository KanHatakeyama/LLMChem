        "Reason": "The target compound has two functional groups that will impact its melting point compared to benzene. Benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. First, the carboxylic acid group (C(=O)OH) is highly polar and can form strong hydrogen bonds, significantly increasing the melting point. This functional group generally increases the melting point of a compound by approximately 170 degrees Celsius. Secondly, the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) is highly electronegative and introduces both inductive effects and increased molecular weight. This group typically raises the melting point of a compound like benzene by around 45 degrees Celsius. These two functional group contributions to the melting point are additive.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (benzene) + 170 (carboxylic acid) + 45 (trifluoromethyl) = 220.5",
        "Prediction(integer)": 220.5
