        "Reason": "Using but-1-ene as a basic structure, which has a melting point of -185.3 degrees Celsius, each additional methyl group typically increases the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. The presence of one methyl group normally adds approximately +9 degrees Celsius. However, since there are three methyl groups in 2,3,3-trimethyl-1-butene and they are in close proximity to each other, the magnitude of their effect might be less than if they were more spread out due to steric hindrance. This proximity may slightly reduce the influence of each methyl group to about +7 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the introduction of the double bond typically raises the melting point when comparing to saturated hydrocarbons, but as we're comparing to but-1-ene, a molecule already with a double bond, this effect has already been considered in the base value.",

        "Reason": "Using but-1-ene as the base structure, which has a melting point of -185.3 degrees Celsius, the addition of methyl groups tends to increase the melting point due to enhanced van der Waals forces caused by the larger molecular size. Typically, each methyl group might add about +9 degrees Celsius to the melting point. Since there are three methyl groups in 2,3,3-trimethyl-1-butene, we would start by adding +27 degrees Celsius. However, their effect is likely diminished by steric hindrance due to the fact that they are located close to one another; thus, we will conservatively estimate them to contribute +7 degrees Celsius each. The total estimated increase from the methyl groups would then be +21 degrees Celsius. As there's a double bond in but-1-ene, no additional modifications for the double bond in 2,3,3-trimethyl-1-butene are needed.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is ethene (ethylene), which has a melting point of \u2212169.2 \u00b0C. Each additional methyl group increases branching, which typically decreases the melting point because it creates a less regular structure that packs less efficiently in a solid state. Alkenes also have weaker intermolecular forces compared to alkanes due to less effective overlapping of their orbitals caused by the geometry of the double bond. The effect of branching in alkanes is roughly \u221220 \u00b0C per methyl group for small alkyl branches.",
