        "Reason": "The melting point of a compound like 1-bromooctane can be influenced by several factors including its molecular weight, branching, and the presence of functional groups such as the bromine atom. Starting with the basic unit, octane (an alkane with 8 carbon atoms), which has a melting point of -57 degrees Celsius. Bromine is a heavy atom and its presence usually raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and stronger van der Waals forces. However, because it is attached at the end of a long alkyl chain (1-position), it does not contribute significantly to the overall molecular geometry or cause much steric hindrance that could raise the melting point substantially. The presence of the bromine atom may increase the melting point slightly due to the increased polarity it introduces and the higher molecular weight. Estimated increase due to bromine group: +2 degrees Celsius.",
