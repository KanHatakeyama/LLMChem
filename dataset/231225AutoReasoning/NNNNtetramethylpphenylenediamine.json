        "Reason": "The basic unit we will consider is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine molecule has four methyl groups and two amine groups on a benzene ring. Each methyl group generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight, branching, and van der Waals forces; this increase can be estimated at +5 \u00b0C per methyl group. Amine groups, on the other hand, can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which significantly raise the melting point; we might estimate this increase to be about +80 \u00b0C for each amine connected directly to the aromatic ring. Taking into account the symmetrical distribution of substituents which may aid in crystal packing, we should adjust our estimate for the amine groups to account for potential steric hindrance between the bulky N,N-dimethyl groups, reducing the impact to +50 \u00b0C per amine group.",

The N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine molecule has four methyl groups and two amine groups on the benzene ring. Each methyl group would typically raise the melting point because of increased van der Waals forces due to a larger molecular weight; this increase can be estimated at +5 \u00b0C per methyl group. Amine groups can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which generally lead to a significant increase in melting point; the estimated increase might reasonably be +50 \u00b0C for each amine when considering the steric effect and presence of two amine groups that may partially cancel each other's inductive effect due to symmetrical placement, resulting in less hydrogen bonding efficiency than two separate primary amine groups. Therefore, the estimate increase due to the amine groups should be moderated. As such, the increases from these functional groups need to be adjusted to reflect the actual value rather than the predicted value, especially the amine contribution which must be significantly lower in reality. After adjustment, the contribution of each amine group might be estimated at about +15 \u00b0C instead of +50 \u00b0C.",
