        "Reason": "The basic unit for the compound is an anhydroglucose unit, which for simplicity we can compare to glucose with a melting point of 146 degrees Celsius. Each of the nitrate ester groups (tetranitrate) contributes to increasing the melting point due to both the introduction of stronger -NO2 dipole interactions and the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. Each nitrate ester might increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The propyl group is a non-polar alkyl chain that typically slightly decreases the melting point when attached to a polar molecule, due to the decreased overall polarity and potential disruption of crystalline packing. The decrease could be around -5 degrees Celsius for the propyl group. Considering all modifications: Glucose base (146) + 4 nitrates (4*10 = +40) - propyl group (-5), the predicted melting point could be approximately 181 degrees Celsius.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for the compound is an anhydroglucose unit, which has a similar structure to glucose that has a melting point of 146 degrees Celsius. Each nitrate ester group (-ONO2) is expected to significantly increase the melting point due to the highly electronegative nitro group's capability of forming strong intermolecular interactions, such as dipole-dipole attractions and potential hydrogen bonding. This effect might be more pronounced than in other substituents, hence we can estimate an increase of approximately +15 degrees Celsius for each nitrate group. The propyl group, being a non-polar alkyl chain, typically has a very modest impact on the melting point, but it could slightly decrease it due to the disruption of packing in the solid state; however, because the compound is highly substituted and the propyl effect is minimal, we can estimate a small decrease of around -2 degrees Celsius. Considering all functional group contributions: Glucose base (146) + 4 nitrates (4*15 = +60) - propyl group (-2), the predicted melting point should be approximately 204 degrees Celsius.",
