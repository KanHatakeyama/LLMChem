        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of codeine methyl bromide, we should consider the various functional groups present in the molecule and their respective contributions to the melting point, based on known effects of similar groups within the relevant structural context. Codeine itself has a basic structure similar to that of morphine, with additional functional groups that affect its melting point. \n\n- Basic morphine scaffold: Known to have a melting point around 253\u00b0C (morphine). \n- Methoxy group (OCH3): May slightly lower the melting point due to its electron-donating effects which might disrupt the crystal lattice, but its influence is minor in this complex structure (-5\u00b0C).\n- Methyl group (CH3): Typically, methyl substitutions slightly increase the melting point due to added van der Waals forces, but again, the impact is relatively small in this complex molecular context (+5\u00b0C).\n- Bromide (Br): The presence of a large halogen atom like bromide substantially increases the melting point due to its significant influence on the ionic character and crystal lattice stability (+7\u00b0C).",
