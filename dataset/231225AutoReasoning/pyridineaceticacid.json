        "Reason": "Starting with pyridine which has a melting point of 42\u00b0C, we consider the functional group modifications. The acetic acid moiety introduces both a carboxylic acid group and an ethyl spacer. The carboxylic acid group establishes additional hydrogen bonding that would significantly increase the melting point (+70 to +100 due to extensive hydrogen bonding capabilities and dimer formation). The ethyl spacer adds a minor increase due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions (+5 to +10). The combined effect of these groups is expected to increase the melting point relative to the basic pyridine structure.",
