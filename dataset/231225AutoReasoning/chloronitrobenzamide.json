        "Reason": "The melting point for the base structure of benzene is 5.5 \u00b0C. Each substituent on the benzene ring will influence the melting point. The chlorine atom, being an electron-withdrawing group through its inductive effect, would increase the melting point due to increasing the compound's overall polarity; this can be estimated as +50. The nitro group is also an electron-withdrawing group and will contribute a similar effect as chlorine; estimated impact is +60. The amide group has a significant impact on the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, which makes the lattice structure harder to break. This can significantly increase the melting point, estimated as +70. Collectively, these functional groups will likely lead to a higher melting point when compared to benzene's base value.",
