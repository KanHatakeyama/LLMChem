        "Reason": "The target compound, bromophos, has multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. The basic unit here can be considered as benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The influences of the functional groups are as follows: three halogens (chlorine and bromine) contribute to increasing the melting point due to their high electronegativity and increased molecular weight (chlorine: +20\u00b0C each, bromine: +30\u00b0C); the diethyl phosphate group, which consists of an alkyl phosphate ester and a thiophosphate (sulfur containing), contributes significantly due to the presence of phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, imparting strong intermolecular interactions (dipole-dipole, hydrogen bonding potential and van der Waals forces) and a possible increase of +50\u00b0C. Adding the contributions, we have benzene (5.5\u00b0C) + 2 chlorine (+40\u00b0C) + bromine (+30\u00b0C) + diethyl thiophosphate group (+50\u00b0C).",

        "Reason": "The target compound bromophos consists of a benzene ring with three halogen substituents (two chlorines and one bromine) and a diethyl thiophosphate group. The base melting point is for benzene, which is 5.5\u00b0C. Each chlorine atom typically increases the melting point by about 20\u00b0C due to an increase in molecular weight and intermolecular attractions from its electronegativity, contributing +40\u00b0C for two chlorines. Bromine, which is larger and more electropositive than chlorine, would add approximately +30\u00b0C due to similar reasons but with a greater van der Waals contribution. The diethyl thiophosphate group would significantly raise the melting point due to the potential for dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, and enhanced van der Waals forces provided by its oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms; such a complex functional group could increase the melting point by roughly +60\u00b0C. Summing these contributions gives benzene (5.5\u00b0C) + 2 chlorines (+40\u00b0C) + bromine (+30\u00b0C) + diethyl thiophosphate group (+60\u00b0C) results in an additive effect.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for bromophos to consider is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the various substituents on the benzene ring will affect the melting point. An alkoxy group usually raises the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding; let's estimate this as +15\u00b0C per alkoxy group. The compound has two chlorine atoms, which are electron-withdrawing and also increase melting point due to increased molecular polarity and mass; we can estimate about +45\u00b0C per chlorine. A bromine atom also increases the melting point because of increased molecular mass and Van der Waals forces; let's estimate that as +70\u00b0C. The P=O group in the organophosphorus ester can have a variable effect due to its potential for both inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, but let's consider it as +20\u00b0C for this purpose. Given that we have one such P=O group, we need to adjust for three alkoxy groups, two chlorines, and one bromine. Summing these adjustments: basic benzene (5.5) + 3 alkoxy groups (3*15) + 2 chlorines (2*45) + 1 bromine (70) + 1 P=O group (20), we get an estimated melting point.",
