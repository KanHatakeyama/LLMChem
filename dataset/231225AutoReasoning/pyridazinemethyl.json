        "Reason": "The base compound, pyridazine, has a melting point of around 20-25\u00b0C. Adding a methyl group to the ring usually increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and slight elevation of the van der Waals forces, but in aromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms like pyridazine, the effect can be more pronounced due to possible electronic effects on the ring system. Considering the base compound's value, the methyl group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 150-160\u00b0C.",
