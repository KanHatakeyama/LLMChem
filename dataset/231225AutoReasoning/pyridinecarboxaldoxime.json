        "Reason": "The base unit for the pyridine ring has a melting point of around -42 degrees Celsius. The carboxaldoxime functional group attached to the pyridine ring would significantly increase this melting point due to the introduction of hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The oxime group (-C=NOH) can form hydrogen bonds which greatly increases the melting point. We can estimate this increase to be around +100 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the aldehyde group bonded to the oxime (-CHO) further contributes to the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding. This might contribute an additional +40 degrees Celsius. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring also contributes to hydrogen bonding due to its lone pair and increases the melting point compared to benzene.",

        "Reason": "The basic pyridine ring, which has a melting point of around 20 degrees Celsius, forms the foundational structure of pyridine-4-carboxaldoxime. The oxime group (-C=NOH) attached to the ring is known for its ability to engage in strong hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which could contribute to an increase in the melting point by about +80 degrees Celsius. The aldehyde group (-CHO), though not as influential as the oxime in terms of hydrogen bonding, can still increase the melting point through additional dipole-dipole interactions, estimated to raise the melting point by about +15 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the nitrogen in the pyridine ring enhances molecular stability and slightly raises the melting point through its lone pair, which can engage in hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, potentially adding another +10 degrees Celsius. Combining these adjustments provides the total estimated increase to the melting point of the compound.",
