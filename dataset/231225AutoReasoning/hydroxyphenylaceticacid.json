        "Reason": "The basic unit to consider is phenylacetic acid, which contains a benzene ring, a methylene group, and a carboxylic acid group. The benzene ring provides a certain level of rigidity and planarity to the molecule, contributing to higher intermolecular forces, and thus a higher melting point compared to aliphatic acids. The carboxylic acid can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, significantly raising the melting point. Phenylacetic acid itself has a melting point of around 76.5 degrees Celsius. The hydroxy group at the para-position relative to the carboxylic acid group introduces additional hydrogen bonding capability, which should further increase the melting point. Quantitatively, the effects of these groups are roughly as follows: benzene ring (base benzene melting point is 5.5 degrees Celsius): +25, methylene group: +20, carboxylic acid group: +50, hydroxy group: +50. Thus, the total predicted increase in melting point due to these functional groups would be 145 degrees Celsius (25+20+50+50) compared to benzene's base melting point.",
