        "Reason": "The base structure for this compound is naphthalene, which has a melting point of approximately 80 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two bromine atoms, which are heavy and large, significantly increases the melting point due to added van der Waals forces and potential for dipole interactions. Each bromine might be expected to add about 40-50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, two methyl groups are present, which could slightly increase the melting point further due to a larger molecular surface area that adds to van der Waals forces. Each methyl group might contribute an increase of about 5-10 degrees Celsius.",

        "Reason": "The base structure for 1,4-dibromo-2,3-dimethylnaphthalene is naphthalene, which has a melting point of approximately 80 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two bromine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to their relatively high atomic mass and added van der Waals forces as well as dipole-dipole interactions. Each bromine atom is predicted to increase the melting point by approximately 40 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the molecule has two methyl groups. These groups can increase the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and surface area, thus augmenting van der Waals interactions. We can expect each methyl group to contribute an increase of about 5 degrees Celsius.",
