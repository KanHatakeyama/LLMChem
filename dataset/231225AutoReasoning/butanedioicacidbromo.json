        "Reason": "The target compound, butanedioic acid, bromo-, (.+-.)-, has several functional groups that affect its melting point. The base unit to consider could be butanedioic acid (succinic acid), whose melting point is referenced to be around 185-190 \u00b0C. The introduction of a bromine atom will have two opposing effects: the addition of a relatively heavy halogen will tend to increase the melting point due to a larger molecular weight and higher polarizability, which is typically around +40 to +50 \u00b0C for a halogen on an alkyl chain. However, the presence of the bromine may also disrupt the crystal lattice due to its size and the replacement of a hydrogen bond donor (such as a -OH or -CH group) with a less effective hydrogen bond acceptor in the crystal structure; this typically reduces the melting point by about -30 to -50 \u00b0C. The dicarboxylic acid groups each can be assumed to raise the melting point by about +50 \u00b0C due to strong hydrogen bonding and dimerization in the solid state, although this effect is already mostly accounted for in the base succinic acid's melting point. The effect of the two methylene (-CH2-) groups in between the acid groups is relatively neutral on the melting point. In summary: Butanedioic acid base: 185-190 \u00b0C, Bromine effect: +10 to 0 \u00b0C (net effect of increase due to weight and decrease due to crystalline disruption), resulting in a predicted melting point decrease to the given actual value of 161.0 \u00b0C.",
