        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of about 6.5\u00b0C. Adamantane, which is a tricyclic cage-like hydrocarbon structure derived from cyclohexane units, has a significantly higher melting point of 269\u00b0C due to the highly symmetrical and compact 3-D structure that maximizes van der Waals interactions, leading to increased stability and higher melting point. The hydroxyl group generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, which is a strong intermolecular force that requires additional energy to overcome. However, in the case of 1-hydroxyadamantane, the hydrogen bonding is limited to only one hydroxyl group and the rigid structure may limit the overall impact of this functional group on the melting point. We will predict the functional group effect of the hydroxyl group to be a moderate increase of approximately 12\u00b0C over the adamantane's melting point.",
