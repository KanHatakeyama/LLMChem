        "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by its molecular structure, including the nature and arrangement of functional groups. For tert-butyl acrylate, we analyze the influence of individual groups on a hypothetical basic unit acrylate (acrylic acid ester) which might have an estimated melting point similar to acrylic acid itself, around 13\u00b0C. The tert-butyl group is large and bulky, which can disrupt the crystal lattice, generally decreasing the melting point. The ester linkage (OC(=O)) can allow for some dipole-dipole interactions, but less so than the acid group it replaces, which could slightly increase the melting point compared to aliphatic hydrocarbons but is offset by the bulky tert-butyl. The vinyl group (C=C) provides rigidity to the molecule which may slightly increase the melting point, but has minimal effect due to its small size. Combining these effects: Ester vs Acid: +5\u00b0 (from associative interactions), Bulky tert-butyl group: -60\u00b0 to -80\u00b0 (from steric hindrance and disruption of packing), Vinyl group: +5\u00b0 (from rigidity).",
