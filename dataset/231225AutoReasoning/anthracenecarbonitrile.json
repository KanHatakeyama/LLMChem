        "Reason": "The basic unit for the compound's structure is anthracene, which has a melting point of around 217 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the nitrile (-C\u2261N) group to the anthracene core generally increases the melting point due to its strong polar character and potential for dipole-dipole interactions; however, in some cases, the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitrile group can also perturb the pi-stacking interactions of the anthracene rings, potentially lowering the melting point. This gives conflicting effects within the structure. Given that nitrile groups typically raise melting points by approximately 20-40 degrees Celsius in other compounds, but considering the potential disturbance of pi-stacking from the electron-withdrawing effect which might reduce the melting point by a similar magnitude, we estimate a smaller change. Therefore, the net change may be minimal due to the opposing forces at play.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is anthracene, which has a melting point of 218 degrees Celsius due to its extended aromatic system that provides a large, flat surface for stacking in the solid state, leading to strong intermolecular London dispersion forces. Adding a cyano (nitrile) group to the anthracene core generally increases the melting point because of the highly electronegative nitrogen. The nitrile group increases polarity and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions. However, the substitution may also disrupt the optimal stacking of the flat aromatic systems, potentially reducing the melting point. Taking these opposing effects into account, we can consider a decrease of about 43 degrees Celsius due to the disruption caused by the nitrile group (218 - 43 = 175).",
