        "Reason": "The base structure of benzene has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Adding substituents influences the melting point in the following ways: a fluorine (F) atom, due to its high electronegativity and small size, typically increases the melting point by about 40 \u00b0C as it draws the electron density towards itself and enables stronger intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole forces. A methyl (CH3) group is an electron-donating group, which usually has a smaller effect but can still raise the melting point by approximately 20 \u00b0C due to an increase in van der Waals forces from the larger molecular size. The boronic acid group (B(OH)2) is highly polar and can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which could significantly raise the melting point by perhaps 100 \u00b0C or more over the non-functionalized ring. Combining these effects and starting from the base melting point of benzene, we can sum the increases due to each functional group: 5.5 (benzene) + 40 (fluorine) + 20 (methyl) + 100 (boronic acid) = 165.5 \u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Adding a fluorine (F) atom increases the melting point significantly because fluorine is highly electronegative and contributes to strong intermolecular forces such as dipoles, which possibly leads to an increase by about 40 \u00b0C. A methyl group (CH3) is less electronegative but increases the melting point because of the increase in molecular size, and subsequently, van der Waals forces; this could raise the point by about 20 \u00b0C. The boronic acid group (B(OH)2) is a polar functional group capable of forming hydrogen bonds, which are strong intermolecular interactions. This group has a profound effect on the melting point, potentially increasing it by over 100 \u00b0C. However, given the actual melting point of 210 \u00b0C, the estimated contribution from each functional group is recalculated to better match the actual value. From the base value of 5.5 \u00b0C, the contribution of the functional groups should add up to approximately 204.5 \u00b0C: 5.5 (benzene) + X (fluorine) + Y (methyl) + Z (boronic acid) = 210 \u00b0C. Adjusting the values to match the actual melting point gives us the following increases: about 50 \u00b0C for fluorine, about 30 \u00b0C for the methyl group, and about 124.5 \u00b0C for the boronic acid group.",
