        "Reason": "The target compound has multiple functional groups that influence its melting point. Basic unit 1,3-thiazole typically has a melting point around 120\u00b0C. Each phenyl group: +30\u00b0C (due to the increased rigidity and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions). Fluorine atoms: +5\u00b0C for each fluorine due to the electronegativity and the increase in intermolecular forces (van der Waals) it provides. Nitrile group (C#N): +10 due to its linear shape and electronegativity. Hydrazono group: +15 due to additional nitrogen double bond providing more rigidity. Summing up the contributions, 120 (base) + 60 (2 phenyl groups) + 15 (three fluorine atoms on one phenyl) + 5 (one fluorine on the other phenyl) + 10 (nitrile group) + 15 (hydrazono group) = 225\u00b0C.",
