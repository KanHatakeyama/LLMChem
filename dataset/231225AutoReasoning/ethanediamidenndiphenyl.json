        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is ethanediamide (oxalamide), which has a melting point of around 238-240\u00b0C. The two phenyl groups in n,n'-diphenyl-ethanediamide would both increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular interactions, such as pi-pi stacking and dispersion forces between the aromatic rings. Each phenyl group adds significantly to the melting point; based on similar aromatic substitutions, an estimated increase of about 7 to 8\u00b0C per phenyl group can be assumed.",
