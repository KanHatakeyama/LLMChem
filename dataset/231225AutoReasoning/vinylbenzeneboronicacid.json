        "Reason": "The compound 4-vinylbenzeneboronic acid consists of a benzene ring basic unit, a vinyl group (\u2013CH=CH2), and a boronic acid (\u2013B(OH)2) group. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The vinyl group typically increases the melting point due to additional pi bonding, which can be estimated to raise it by about 20-30\u00b0C. However, the boronic acid group is capable of forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which would significantly increase the melting point. This group could be expected to raise the melting point by approximately 150-170\u00b0C. When these increments are added to the benzene base, the shift in melting point can be accounted for in the following manner: Benzene basic unit: 5.5\u00b0C, Vinyl group: +25\u00b0C, Boronic acid group: +160\u00b0C",
