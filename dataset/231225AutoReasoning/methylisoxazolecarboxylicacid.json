        "Reason": "Starting with the isoxazole ring as our basic unit, which has a melting point around 90\u00b0C. The 3-methyl group generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which we can estimate to add about +10\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group at the 4-position contributes significantly to the melting point by introducing the potential for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, we can estimate an increase of about +80\u00b0C. Additionally, the conjugation of carboxylic acid with the aromatic system can provide extra rigidity to the structure, increasing the melting point slightly. However, this conjugation effect is hard to quantify exactly but might add an extra few degrees to the melting point, estimated to be around +5\u00b0C.",
