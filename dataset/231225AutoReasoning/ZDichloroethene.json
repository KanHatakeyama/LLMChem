        "Reason": "The basic unit ethylene has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. Chlorine substituents tend to increase the melting point because of their relatively high mass and their ability to enhance the polarizability of the molecule, which increases intermolecular forces such as van der Waals forces. Each chlorine is expected to raise the melting point significantly. However, since the compound has a (Z)-configuration, the two chlorines are on the same side which may limit the extent of the increase due to some steric hindrance. The effect of one chlorine is substantial, approximated at around +45\u00b0C per chlorine atom.",
