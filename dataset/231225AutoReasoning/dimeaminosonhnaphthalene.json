For such a functional group, the increase might be about +100\u00b0C.\n- Structural rigidity: The addition of these groups to the naphthalene core also increases the rigidity of the molecule, which typically results in a higher melting point.

        "Reason": "The target compound is based on a naphthalene structure. The basic naphthalene has a melting point of 80.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of substituents will affect this value. Each -NH2 (amine) group is expected to increase the melting point by about 15 due to an increase in hydrogen bonding capabilities. The presence of the -SO2NH2 (sulfonamide) group adds both bulk and potential for hydrogen bonding which can significantly increase the melting point, estimated at around 70. The dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group increases steric hindrance and adds some bulk, which would slightly increase the melting point by about 20. However, it's important to note that the -N(CH3)2 group may not have hydrogen bonding potential like -NH2 or -SO2NH2, therefore its effect will be more moderate.",
