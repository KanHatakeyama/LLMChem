Adding bromine atoms to ethane increases the molecular weight and enhances intermolecular attractions, specifically van der Waals forces. Each bromine atom also contributes to an increase in the polarizability of the molecule, which boosts the London dispersion forces. Given that each bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom, the effect on the melting point would be significant, but not as much as +50 to +60 degrees per bromine atom. Due to size considerations and increased London dispersion forces, a reasonable estimate for each bromine atom's contribution could be in the region of +40 to +50 degrees Celsius.",
