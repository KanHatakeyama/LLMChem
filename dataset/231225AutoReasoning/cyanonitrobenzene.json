        "Reason": "The compound 3-cyano-1-nitrobenzene has a benzene ring as its base structure with a boiling point of 80\u00b0C. The addition of a nitro group (-NO2) significantly raises the boiling point due to the introduction of strong dipoles and potential for hydrogen bonding; it can be estimated to increase it by about +50\u00b0C. The cyano group (-C#N) also introduces a sizeable dipole moment, which might lead to an increase, but to a lesser degree compared to nitro group, estimated at +15\u00b0C. These functional groups also increase the molecular weight and contribute to intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces), further increasing the boiling point. However, the overall effect of the cyano group is tempered due to potential steric hindrance with the nitro group on the benzene ring, which can constrain molecule packing and reduce the overall boiling point increase by about -5\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basis for the predicted melting point of 3-cyano-1-nitrobenzene starts with the benzene ring, which has a basic melting point of around 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the nitro group increases the melting point due to its strong electronegativity and ability to participate in strong dipole-dipole interactions, contributing an estimated increase of +40\u00b0C. In addition, the cyano group also increases the melting point as it contributes to polarity and potential dipole-dipole interactions, yet to a lesser extent, with an estimated increase of +20\u00b0C. Combining these increases, and considering that the positions of the substituents (ortho to each other) may cause steric hindrance that somewhat disrupts optimal packing and lowers the melting point slightly, an estimated decrease of -5\u00b0C should be considered.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison here is benzene which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a cyano (\u2013C\u2261N:) group typically increases the melting point due to its ability to increase the polarity of the molecule and contribute to stronger dipole-dipole interactions, which might add around +70\u00b0C. Additionally, the nitro (\u2013NO2) group is also a strong electron-withdrawing group, which increases the intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole and hydrogen bonding if applicable) and hence the melting point. We can estimate the presence of a nitro group to contribute an additional +30\u00b0C. However, since there is both a cyano and a nitro substitution on the benzene ring, we should also consider the possibility of some intramolecular interactions that might not increase the melting point as much as when they are considered separately.",
