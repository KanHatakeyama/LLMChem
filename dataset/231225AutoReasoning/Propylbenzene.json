        "Reason": "The propylbenzene consists of a benzene ring with a propyl (three carbons) substituent. The benzene ring has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of alkyl groups generally increases the melting point slightly due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces; however, in the case of long alkyl chains, they can decrease the melting point due to the introduction of a more flexible and less planar structure that interrupts the crystallinity. For propyl, a larger group than methyl or ethyl, this decrease effect may be significant. Since benzene's melting point is relatively low, we expect that propyl group might lower the melting point significantly, between -5 to -10 degrees Celsius than benzene itself.",

        "Reason": "The melting point of benzene is 5.5 degrees Celsius. A propyl group typically increases the melting point slightly due to increased van der Waals attractions, which arises from a higher molecular weight when comparing to hydrogen atoms it replaces. Normally, this increase might be around +5 degrees Celsius. However, the significant increase in chain length and the flexibility from the propyl group disrupts the regular packing of the compound and can increase the compound's ability to rotate and move, thus destabilizing the crystal lattice and decreasing the melting point. This can lead to a net decrease in the melting point of the molecule. The effect of the propyl chain could be estimated to lower the melting point by about -20 to -25 degrees Celsius compared to benzene.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. A propyl group (CCC) is likely to lower the melting point due to the increase in flexibility and nonpolar character of the molecule, making its crystal packing less efficient compared to benzene. Each methylene group (CH2) in the propyl chain might be estimated to lower the melting point by about -20 to -30 degrees Celsius.",
