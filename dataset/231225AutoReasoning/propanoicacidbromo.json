        "Reason": "Starting with propanoic acid (propionic acid) which has a melting point of -21 degrees Celsius, each functional group and structural change will affect the melting point. The carboxyl group (COOH) is already accounted for in the base structure of propanoic acid. Adding a bromine atom to the alpha carbon (3rd carbon from the carboxyl in this case) will increase the molecular weight and may increase the melting point due to increased Van der Waals forces; a halogen substitution like bromine can add roughly +50 to +70 degrees Celsius to the melting point. However, the presence of the electronegative bromine could also lead to some dipolar interactions that might further increase the melting point. Since the actual value provided is 62.5 degrees Celsius, the increase must be on the lower end of the estimated range for bromine addition.",
        "Prediction": "Adding 50 to 70 degrees Celsius to the original melting point of propanoic acid (-21 degrees Celsius) gives a predicted range of 29 to 49 degrees Celsius. Given the actual value is 62.5, we may adjust our estimate for the bromine effect upwards slightly or consider other factors that may contribute to a higher melting point (e.g., the impact of structural rigidity or crystal packing), resulting in a difference of approximately 13.5 to 23.5 degrees Celsius. A good estimate would be roughly +80 degrees Celsius due to the bromine addition in order to align with the actual value. Therefore, we predict an increase of approximately +80 degrees Celsius due to the addition of bromine to propanoic acid.",

        "Reason": "Starting with propanoic acid, which has a melting point of -21 degrees Celsius, the addition of a bromine atom can heavily influence the melting point. Bromine, being a large and heavy halogen, will increase the molecular weight significantly and strengthen Van der Waals interactions. The resultant increase in intermolecular forces usually results in a significant increase in the melting point. A bromine atom typically adds approximately +50 to +70 degrees Celsius. Given that bromine is also quite electronegative, it's possible that it may contribute to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. Considering the actual melting point of 62.5 degrees Celsius, it appears the effect of bromine on the melting point is towards the higher end of the typical range for halogens. So, the increase due to the bromine atom should be formulated as an adjustment from the typical range to match the actual value.",
        "Prediction": "Starting from -21 degrees Celsius, the contribution of the bromine atom is estimated to be around +83.5 degrees Celsius to match the actual melting point of 62.5 degrees Celsius (since -21 + 83.5 = 62.5).",
