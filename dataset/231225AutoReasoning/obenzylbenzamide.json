        "Reason": "The basic unit here is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Benzyl (-CH2Ph) group generally increases the melting point due to its larger molecular weight and ability to participate in van der Waals interactions; we can estimate it to contribute around +20\u00b0C. The amide group is strongly polar and can engage in hydrogen bonding, which substantially increases the melting point, estimated to be about +130\u00b0C. The ortho-configuration can lead to some steric hindrance that might slightly lower the melting point, but it may also result in stronger intermolecular interactions which could counterbalance this effect. This effect is challenging to quantify but let's estimate a +5\u00b0C variation to account for this structural effect.",
