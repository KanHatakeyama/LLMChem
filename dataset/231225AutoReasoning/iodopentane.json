        "Reason": "The basic unit for alkanes, methane, has a melting point of -182.5\u00b0C. For each additional carbon in a straight chain, there is a general trend of an increase by approximately 20\u00b0C. However, branches and the presence of heteroatoms must be considered. The iodine atom in 2-iodopentane introduces significant mass and polarizability, which can increase the melting point, but its bulky size and the polar nature of the C-I bond may lead to lower packing efficiency, thus reducing the melting point increment. Iodine may contribute an increase of approximately 40\u00b0C due to size and polarizability, while the branching at the second carbon could decrease the melting point by about 5\u00b0C when compared with a straight-chain compound. Therefore, the net predicted change due to iodine could be +35\u00b0C. Starting from methane: -182.5\u00b0C + (4 * 20\u00b0C for additional carbons) + 35\u00b0C for iodine - 5\u00b0C for branching.",
