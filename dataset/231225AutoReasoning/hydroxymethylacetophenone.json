Carbonyl group (C=O) as part of the acyl moiety: generally elevates the melting point due to polar nature and the possibility of hydrogen bonding (estimate: +20\u00b0C). \nHowever, the overall structure of the molecule and potential steric hindrance between functional groups must be considered. The hydroxy and carbonyl groups, being on the same ring, might not lead to as high an increase as they would separately due to intramolecular interactions and the hydrophobic effect of the methyl group.",

The hydroxy group (OH) present can significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds; this is estimated to provide an increase of +40\u00b0C. The methyl group (CH3) adds a smaller increase due to a slight increase in molecular weight and the hydrophobic effect; an increase of +5\u00b0C is reasonable. The carbonyl group (C=O) in an acetyl function is also polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, which generally raises the melting point; here, an increase of +20\u00b0C is estimated. However, due to intramolecular interactions and potential steric hindrance, these increases may not be fully additive. Notably, the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydroxy and carbonyl groups could lower the overall melting point increase attributed to those groups. Adjusting for this potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding, a more conservative estimate for the combined effect of the hydroxy and carbonyl groups is +50\u00b0C (instead of +60\u00b0C).",

The carbonyl (C=O) in acetophenone introduces polarity and possible intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, which could raise the melting point; an estimated increase could be +40.

The carbonyl (C=O) in the acetophenone structure is likely to increase the melting point due to polar interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group, this could increase it by +16.5\u00b0C.

The electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group also stabilizes the molecule and contributes an additional +30\u00b0C. However, steric hindrance can impede effective hydrogen bonding, which may lead to a less pronounced effect from the hydroxyl group; therefore, we might need to reduce its contribution slightly by about -10\u00b0C.
