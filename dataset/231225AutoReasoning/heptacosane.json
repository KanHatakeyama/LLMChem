        "Reason": "Basic unit, methane has a melting point of -182. The addition of each CH2 group will increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. For long-chain alkanes, each additional CH2 unit typically increases the melting point by about 2-3 degrees Celsius. With 26 additional CH2 groups in heptacosane (C27H56 compared to methane CH4), the increase can be estimated as 26 * 2.5 (average) = 65 degrees. The branching is absent, which tends to increase the melting point as the straight chain allows for tighter packing.",
