        "Reason": "L-menthol is a cyclic terpene alcohol, possessing both a hydroxyl group and multiple non-aromatic carbon rings. Basis compound: Cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5. - Hydroxyl group: +40 (hydrogen bonding significantly increases the melting point). - Tertiary carbon structure: +20 (bulkiness around the hydroxyl group hinders rotation and packing, which increases the melting point). - Branched carbon chains: +5 (increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions). - Isopropyl group: +5 (as an additional branch that increases the melting point through molecular complexity). Prediction: 77 (6.5 as the baseline for cyclohexane, +40 for hydroxyl group, +20 for tertiary carbon structure, +5 for branched carbon chains, +5 for the isopropyl group)",

        "Reason": "L-menthol has a complex structure with a hydroxyl group, multiple non-aromatic carbon rings, and branched chains. As a basis for comparison, cyclohexane, which is similar in being a non-aromatic ring compound, has a melting point of 6.5. The additional functional groups in L-menthol will have different effects on its melting point. The hydroxyl group will contribute significantly to an increase due to strong hydrogen bonding, estimated at +50. The tertiary carbon structure of the molecule, along with the cyclic nature of its backbone, will also increase the melting point due to steric hindrance and rigidity of the molecule, estimated at +10. The branched carbon chains, such as isopropyl and methyl groups, provide an additional increase due to van der Waals forces and hindered packing, estimated at +2 for the branched chains and +3 for the isopropyl group. Taking all these contributions together, the predicted melting point would be: 6.5 (for cyclohexane) + 50 (for the hydroxyl group) + 10 (for the tertiary carbon structure) + 2 (for branched carbon chains) + 3 (for isopropyl group) = 71.5.",

        "Reason": "The compound L-menthol has a basic cyclohexane structure, which has a melting point of around 6.5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group typically increases the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, which would add about +30\u00b0C. Each of the three isopropyl groups would add steric bulk, which hinders close packing, but their alkyl nature can increase van der Waals forces slightly, thereby increasing the melting point. The individual isopropyl might contribute around +5\u00b0C each. Overall, the stereochemistry of L-menthol and the presence of a hydroxyl group stabilizes the crystalline structure, increasing the melting point substantially.",
