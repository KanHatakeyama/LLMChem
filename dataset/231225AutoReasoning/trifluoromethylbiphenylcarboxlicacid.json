        "Reason": "The basic unit we can start with is biphenyl, which has a melting point of approximately 70\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which increases the melting point due to the greater electronegativity and the stabilizing effect of strong intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole interactions: +50. The carboxylic acid group can form strong hydrogen bonds, substantially raising the melting point compared to biphenyl itself due to the ability to form dimers and very strong intermolecular forces: +50. Combining these effects, we can adjust the melting point of the basic structure of biphenyl to predict the melting point of the target compound.",
