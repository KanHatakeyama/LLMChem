        "Reason": "The basic unit for heptane has a melting point of around -90 \u00b0C. Each bromine atom attached to the terminal carbons of heptane increases the molecular weight significantly which generally increases the melting point. Additionally, bromine atoms being highly electronegative can lead to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions compared to the purely hydrocarbon chain of heptane. However, the linear structure remains, limiting any significant increase due to lack of compactness or symmetry. Estimating the increase in melting point due to each bromine could be around 65 \u00b0C (due to increase in molecular weight and enhanced van der Waals forces).",
