        "Reason": "The compound 1-chloro-2-methyl-2-propanol includes an isopropyl group, a chloro substituent, and a hydroxyl group (alcohol). Starting with propane as the base structure with a melting point of -188\u00b0C, we consider the following: The addition of an isopropyl group would tend to increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and branching which increases the melting point by roughly 30\u00b0C. A chloro substituent adds substantial mass and some polarity, which may further increase the melting point by approximately 50\u00b0C. However, the introduction of the hydroxyl group provides strong hydrogen bonding, leading to a much higher increase in the melting point, estimated at 120\u00b0C. Combining these modifications: -188 (propane) + 30 (isopropyl) + 50 (chloro) + 120 (hydroxyl), we get a predicted value.",
