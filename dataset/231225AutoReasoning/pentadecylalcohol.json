        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-pentadecyl alcohol can be considered as methanol, which has a melting point of -98 degrees Celsius. For the alkyl chain, each additional -CH2- group increases the surface area and van der Waals forces, typically raising the melting point by approximately 2 degrees Celsius per methylene group compared to methanol. There are 14 additional -CH2- groups in 2-pentadecyl alcohol, which would increase the melting point by 14 * 2 = 28 degrees Celsius. However, this large non-polar alkyl chain also allows for flexibility that can reduce the melting point. The effect of the hydroxyl (-OH) group attached to the second carbon is to increase the melting point through hydrogen bonding, which is a significant effect. Quantitatively, the -OH group could raise the melting point by about 50 degrees Celsius or more compared to the alkyl chain without it. Combining these effects gives an estimated melting point adjustment of -98 + 28 + 50 = -20 degrees Celsius. However, the actual compound has a higher melting point due to the influence of increased molecular weight, which is not fully accounted for in this estimation.",
