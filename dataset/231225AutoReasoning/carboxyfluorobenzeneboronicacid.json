        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The functional groups present in the compound are as follows: carboxylic acid group, fluorine substituent, and boronic acid group. The carboxylic acid group generally increases the melting point due to the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and dimerization, contributing an estimated +160\u00b0C. The fluorine substituent slightly raises the melting point due to its electronegativity and the capability of forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds with nonequivalent molecules, contributing about +20\u00b0C. The boronic acid group contains hydroxyl groups that can also form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, increasing the melting point; this contribution is estimated to be about +30\u00b0C. The total predicted increase from the combination of functional groups is then added to the base value of benzene's melting point.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (base benzene's MP) + 160 (carboxylic acid group) + 20 (fluorine substituent) + 30 (boronic acid group) = 215.5\u00b0C",
        "Prediction(integer)": 215.0
