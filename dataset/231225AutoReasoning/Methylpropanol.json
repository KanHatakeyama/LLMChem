        "Reason": "The compound 2-Methylpropan-2-ol contains the following functional groups and structural features: a tertiary alcohol group and three methyl groups connected to the same carbon atom. The basic unit here is methanol, which has a melting point of -97.6\u00b0C. The addition of three methyl groups will increase the molecular weight and steric hindrance around the hydroxyl group, which tends to raise the melting point. Each methyl group adjacent to the tertiary carbon might contribute approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and branching, which impedes crystal packing. The fact that it is a tertiary alcohol means the hydroxyl group is hindered, which might slightly decrease the ability to form hydrogen bonds compared to a primary alcohol, but will not significantly alter the melting point. Therefore, the overall additive effects of the methyl groups are substantial in raising the melting point of the compound.",
