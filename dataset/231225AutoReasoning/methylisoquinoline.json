        "Reason": "The basic unit for 6-methylisoquinoline is isoquinoline.  The isoquinoline has a melting point around 27 degrees Celsius. The 6-methyl group should increase this value because methyl groups are known to increase the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces. A typical methyl group on a similar aromatic system would raise the melting point by approximately 20-30 degrees Celsius. However, considering that the actual value is 85.5 degrees Celsius, the effect of the methyl group appears to be less than usual, possibly due to the position of the methyl group which might not significantly hinder the packing of the molecules in the solid state.",
        "Prediction": "If starting from 27 degrees Celsius for isoquinoline, adding the effect of the methyl group, which appears to be less than expected but can be estimated around 58.5 degrees Celsius (85.5 - 27), we predict a melting point close to 85.5 degrees Celsius.",
