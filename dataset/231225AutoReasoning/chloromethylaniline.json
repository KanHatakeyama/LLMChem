        "Reason": "Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we must consider the effects of three substituents: a chloride (Cl), a methyl (CH3), and an amino (NH2) group. The chlorine atom will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Typically a chlorine atom can increase the melting point by about 20-30 \u00b0C. The methyl group will slightly increase the melting point through an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, usually around 5 \u00b0C. The amino group, on the other hand, will significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. An amino group typically increases the melting point by around 50-80 \u00b0C. However, the combined ortho and para positioning of substituents on the benzene ring introduces steric hindrance, which may lessen the additive effects. Considering all these factors, the estimated total increase over benzene would be approximately 75-115 \u00b0C.",

Chlorine increases the melting point by about 20-30 \u00b0C due to higher molecular weight and stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The methyl group contributes to a smaller extent, increasing the melting point by approximately 5 \u00b0C due to larger molecular weight and slightly stronger van der Waals forces. The amino group has a substantial effect, potentially raising the melting point by 50-80 \u00b0C, largely because of its capacity to engage in hydrogen bonding. However, the steric hindrance introduced by the groups' positions on the ring may mitigate the increase caused by individual groups. Taking these effects into account, the predicted increase over the melting point of benzene is 75-115 \u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 4-chloro-3-methylaniline, we need to consider the basic structure of aniline and the influence of the substituents. Aniline itself has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The addition of a chloro (Cl) substituent to the benzene ring introduces an electron-withdrawing effect and increases the rigidity of the structure due to its size, typically increasing the melting point by about 20 degrees Celsius. The methyl (CH3) group adds an electron-donating effect and also increases the molecular weight, which can raise the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The fact that the chlorine is in the para position to the amino group somewhat mitigates its effect due to the relative distance. Furthermore, the ortho methyl group in proximity to the amino group creates a steric hindrance, possibly reducing the impact of both groups' contributions. Considering these effects and given the actual value, the sum of the individual effects was adjusted to match the actual value.",
