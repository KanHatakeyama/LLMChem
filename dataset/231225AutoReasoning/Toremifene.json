        "Reason": "Toremifene is a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. The basic unit we can consider is the biphenyl structure (two benzene rings), which has a melting point around 70 \u00b0C. The triphenyl ethylene structure in Toremifene increases the melting point due to the increased rigidity and size of the molecule. Each additional phenyl group can add about 30 \u00b0C due to increased \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and molecular weight. The chlorocyclohexadienyl group adds to this due to the added halogen's electronegativity and size, contributing a significant increase of about 40 \u00b0C. The methoxy group slightly lowers the melting point by about -5 \u00b0C since it provides some flexibility and electron donation to the system. The dimethylamino group can provide an increase due to its size and potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing about 10 \u00b0C. Adding up these changes, we get: 70 (for biphenyl) + 30 (for extra phenyl group) + 40 (for chlorocyclohexadienyl group) + 10 (for dimethylamino group) - 5 (for methoxy group).",

The basic unit we can consider is the biphenyl structure (two benzene rings), which has a melting point around 70 \u00b0C. The extended conjugated system and overall molecular rigidity provided by the triphenyl ethylene structure in Toremifene should boost the melting point as the molecule would resist entering the liquid phase. Each additional aromatic ring typically contributes approximately +20 \u00b0C to the melting point due to increased \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and molecular rigidity. The presence of a chloro group on the alkene part also adds to the melting point by about +20 \u00b0C due to its electronegativity and van der Waals interactions. The methoxy group, however, would slightly lower the melting point due to increased electron donation and flexibility, estimated at about -5 \u00b0C. The tertiary amino group can also increase the melting point owing to its potential for intermolecular interactions, contributing approximately +5 \u00b0C. Therefore, we estimate: 70 (biphenyl base) + 20 (additional phenyl ring) + 20 (chloro group) + 5 (tertiary amino group) - 5 (methoxy group).",
