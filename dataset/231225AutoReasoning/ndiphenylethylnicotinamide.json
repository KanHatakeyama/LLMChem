        "Reason": "The compound n-(1,2-diphenylethyl)nicotinamide is made up of a nicotinamide base, two phenyl groups and an ethyl linker. The basic unit, nicotinamide, has a melting point of around 128\u00b0C. Each phenyl group can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi stacking interactions. The ethyl linker, being a small alkyl chain, will provide some increment due to the increased molecular weight but no significant intermolecular interactions. Considering the effects of the phenyl groups and the ethyl linker, adjustments can be made as follows: Nicotinamide base: 128\u00b0C, each phenyl group: +20\u00b0C, ethyl linker: +1\u00b0C. This leads to an estimated total increase of 41\u00b0C.",
