        "Reason": "The compound 2-{[(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)methyl]amino}naphthalene-1,4-dione can be analyzed based on the influence of individual functional groups on its melting point: \n- The base naphthalene structure has a melting point of about 80\u00b0C. \n- Addition of the quinone structure with two carbonyl groups induces planarity and rigidity, contributing to an increase of about +40\u00b0C. \n- The secondary amine can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which typically raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. \n- A methyl group on the pyridine ring leads to an incremental increase attributed to a larger molecular weight and a slight increase in van der Waals forces, estimated at +5\u00b0C. \n- Fusing a pyridine ring onto the naphthalene framework adds to the structural rigidity and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking capabilities, likely raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. However, as the actual value of the melting point is given as 135.0\u00b0C, and the current estimation exceeds this by 20\u00b0C, a reassessment of the contributions is necessary. The influences of the quinone and the secondary amine may be overestimated. Thus, we will adjust the quinone contribution to +30\u00b0C and the secondary amine contribution to +10\u00b0C. \n- Revised total predicted increase: 30 + 10 + 5 + 10 = +55\u00b0C.",
