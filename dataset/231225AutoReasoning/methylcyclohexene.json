        "Reason": "The basic unit, cyclohexane, has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. The presence of a double bond in cyclohexene typically lowers the melting point significantly due to less efficient packing, which could decrease the melting point by approximately 120\u00b0C. The addition of a methyl group increases the melting point as it adds van der Waals forces, slightly increasing the melting point by about 5\u00b0C.",
