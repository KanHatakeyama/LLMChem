        "Reason": "The parent compound for n,n-diethyl-2-chloroethylamine could be considered as ethylamine, with a melting point around -81. While adding two ethyl groups (+CC) to the amino group (NH) of ethylamine, each might increase the melting point by about +80 due to increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The addition of the chloroethyl group (+CH2CH2Cl) adds not only molecular weight but also polarizability due to the chlorine atom, which could additionally increase the melting point by about +90. The combined influence of these functional groups modifies the initial reference point significantly.",

        "Reason": "The reason for the discrepancy between the predicted and actual melting points lies in the underestimation of the effects each functional group has on the melting point. Ethylamine with a melting point of -81 degrees serves as a reference. The addition of two ethyl groups should have a larger influence than previously estimated due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Instead of +80, this effect per ethyl group might be closer to +95. Furthermore, the chloroethyl group's effect is underestimated. The chlorine atom significantly increases polarizability and intermolecular interactions beyond +90. Considering these adjustments, the correction would be a +95 increase for each ethyl group and at least +100 for the chloroethyl group.",

To this, we need to add the effects of the functional groups present in n,n-diethyl-2-chloroethylamine: two ethyl groups, an amine group, and a chloroethyl group. Each ethyl group contributes +15 to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and branching. The amine group might contribute +40 due to possibilities for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity. The chloroethyl group would add another +60 due to the presence of chlorine which is electronegative and adds significant molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. Combining these effects, we get a total increase of +130.",

The addition of two ethyl groups to the nitrogen (+2 x 25 due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces) raises the boiling point significantly. The chlorine atom substitution on an ethyl group further raises the boiling point due to the higher molecular weight and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions (+35). Therefore, the overall increase in boiling point should be around 85 degrees Celsius from the base structure of ethylamine.",
