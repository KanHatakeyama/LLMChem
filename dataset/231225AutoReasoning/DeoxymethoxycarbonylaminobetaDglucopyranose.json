        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 2-Deoxy-2-[(methoxycarbonyl)amino]-beta-D-glucopyranose, we can consider the following functional groups of the compound based on its structure outlined by the SMILES string: O=C(OC)N[C@@H]1[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O[C@H]1O)CO. The molecule is based on a beta-D-glucopyranose sugar molecule, which alone has a melting point around 146\u00b0C. The methoxycarbonyl group (O=C(OC)), being an ester, generally increases melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, as well as providing dipolar interactions; let's approximate this increase to be about +40\u00b0C. The presence of the amino (NH) group can also form hydrogen bonds, potentially raising the melting point; however, within the context of the sugar ring, its effect might be less pronounced compared to the ester but let's approximate an additional +10\u00b0C. These functional group effects are cumulative but must be adjusted upon considering the entirety of the molecule and its intramolecular interactions.",
