        "Reason": "The target compound 4-isobutylbenzeneacetic acid can be analyzed by considering its structural components. The base structure benzene has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The additional substituents will influence this base value: \n- The isobutyl group (consisting of a propyl chain with a methyl branch) is a larger, branched alkyl chain compared to a methyl group. This increases the molecular weight and the van der Waals forces, thus raising the melting point. If a methyl group typically raises the melting point by about 20 \u00b0C, the more substantial isobutyl group might increase it by around 30 \u00b0C due to its increased size and branching. \n- The acetic acid functional group (\u2013COOH) will introduce hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point due to the strong intermolecular forces. The influence of a typical carboxylic acid group on the melting point can be roughly estimated to be around +50 \u00b0C.\nAdding these effects to the base benzene melting point, we get an estimated total increase of 80 \u00b0C (30 \u00b0C for the isobutyl group and 50 \u00b0C for the acetic acid group).",
