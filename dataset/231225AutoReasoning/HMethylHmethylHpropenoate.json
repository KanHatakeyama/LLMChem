Deuteration tends to increase the melting points due to stronger C-D bonds compared to C-H bonds. This increase is estimated to be around +3 \u00b0C per deuterated methyl group and +1 \u00b0C per deuterated methylene group. For the methyl ester group compared to acrylic acid, we have to consider esterification which normally lowers the melting point due to the reduction of hydrogen bonding.

Deuteration tends to increase the melting points due to stronger C-D bonds compared to C-H bonds.

For the methyl ester group, compared to acrylic acid, we have to consider that esterification usually lowers the melting point due to the reduction of the molecule's ability to engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is a stabilizing force in the solid state. The impact of adding an ester group is estimated to be around -60\u00b0C when compared to the carboxylic acid.

        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of the target compound, we need to consider the effects of its various functional groups and compare them to a known base structure. Let's begin with ethylene (basic two-carbon alkene) as the base structure, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The functional groups in the target compound are as follows:\n\n1. Ester group (\u2013COO\u2013): This group is polar and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, raising the melting point. The ester group typically adds about +40\u00b0C to +50\u00b0C.\n\n2. Deuterated methyl groups (\u2013CD3): Deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, has a greater mass than hydrogen, which might slightly increase the melting point due to higher molecular weight. However, since deuterium forms similar intermolecular bonds with carbon as hydrogen does, the effect on melting point should be insignificant, around +1\u00b0C to +2\u00b0C per deuterated methyl group.\n\n3. Vinyl group: Vinyl groups tend to decrease the melting point when compared to simple alkanes because they are less flexible and cannot pack as well. However, in this case, the overall molecule is rather rigid, so the decrease might be minimal, estimated at around -5\u00b0C.\n\nTaking these factors into account, here's the quantitative prediction:\n\nBase melting point of ethylene: -169.2\u00b0C\nEster group addition: +50\u00b0C\nThree deuterated methyl groups addition: +3 * +2\u00b0C = +6\u00b0C\nVinyl group decrease: -5\u00b0C\n\nSumming these adjustments, we get the predicted melting point:",

        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of the given compound (~2~H3)Methyl 2-(~2~H3)methyl(~2~H2)prop-2-enoate, we start by considering a related simple structure, such as butanoic acid, which has a similar size and carboxylic acid functional group. Butanoic acid has a melting point of -5.5\u00b0C. We then adjust this value based on the contributions of the various functional groups in the target compound:\n\n1. Ester group (\u2013COO\u2013): Compared to the carboxylic acid, the ester functional group is less capable of hydrogen bonding because it lacks the acidic hydrogen, leading to a lower melting point. This effect can be estimated to decrease the melting point by approximately -5\u00b0C to -10\u00b0C.\n\n2. Deuterated methyl groups (\u2013CD3): The substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms increases the molecular weight slightly, which might increase the melting point due to a higher molecular weight, but the effect is usually marginal, around +1\u00b0C to +2\u00b0C per deuterated methyl group.\n\n3. Vinyl group (\u2013C(=C[2H])[2H]): The presence of a vinyl group could result in a lower melting point due to increased rigidity compared to alkanes, which typically hinders close packing. However, this effect is likely small because of the overall molecular rigidity. We could speculate the decrease to be roughly -2\u00b0C to -5\u00b0C.\n\nAdding these effects together, we predict:\nBase melting point of butanoic acid: -5.5\u00b0C\nAdjustment for ester group: -7.5\u00b0C (midpoint of -5\u00b0C to -10\u00b0C)\nAdjustment for three deuterated methyl groups: +3 * +1.5\u00b0C = +4.5\u00b0C (using midpoint of +1\u00b0C to +2\u00b0C)\nAdjustment for vinyl group: -3.5\u00b0C (midpoint of -2\u00b0C to -5\u00b0C)\n\nOur predicted melting point is therefore the sum of these contributions:",

        "Reason": "The given compound is a deuterated version of Methyl methacrylate. In general, the following functional group effects can be considered for estimating the melting point: - The basic ester group (-COO-) typically raises the melting point due to polar interactions. +20\u00b0C. - Deuterium substitution (heavy hydrogen) can result in slightly higher melting points compared to hydrogen due to stronger carbon-deuterium bonds compared to carbon-hydrogen bonds. However, this effect is usually quite small, so we\u2019ll estimate a +3\u00b0C per deuterium substitution for the three positions with deuterium. As there are 9 deuterium atoms replacing hydrogen, this will be +27\u00b0C. - The double bond in an alkene can either slightly increase or decrease the melting point depending on the overall molecular symmetry and packing; in this case, it's a substituted alkene which might disrupt crystalline packing, so we'll estimate a -5\u00b0C. Using these estimates, we can predict the melting point of the non-deuterated base Methyl methacrylate, which is around 160\u00b0C. Applying the adjustments: Base ester value: +20\u00b0C Deuterium effect: +27\u00b0C Alkene effect: -5\u00b0C Total sum of effects: +42\u00b0C Adjusted from the base value of the non-deuterated compound: 160\u00b0C + 42\u00b0C = 202\u00b0C However, since the actual value is given as -48.0\u00b0C, there seems to be a discrepancy. It is likely that the actual value may correspond to the melting point rather than the boiling point, and deuterium effects are overestimated in the prediction.",
