        "Reason": "Starting with a basic unit of ammonia (NH3), which has a melting point of -78\u00b0C, we will add the effects of the functional groups present in 1-cyanoguanidine. The molecule has two amine groups, a nitrile group, and a guanidinium core. Each amine group would raise the melting point due to increased intermolecular hydrogen bonding, by approximately +100\u00b0C per amine group. The guanidinium core significantly increases the melting point due to its high degree of resonance stabilization and potential for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +150\u00b0C. The nitrile group, being linear and polar, could further provide dipole-dipole interactions and increase the melting point, so we can estimate a +50\u00b0C increment for this group. Therefore, the cumulative effect could be calculated as follows: -78 (NH3 base) + 100 (amine group) + 100 (second amine group) + 150 (guanidinium core) + 50 (nitrile group).",

        "Reason": "Starting with a basic unit of ammonia (NH3), which has a melting point of -78\u00b0C, we will adjust the prediction based on the effects of the functional groups in 1-cyanoguanidine. It has two amine groups, a guanidinium core, and a nitrile group. The additional of two amine groups would contribute to increasing the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight; we can estimate an increase of about +80\u00b0C for each amine group. The guanidinium core provides additional sites for hydrogen bonding and due to its planarity and resonance stabilization, we can expect a significant increase, possibly around +100\u00b0C. The nitrile group is a strong polar functional group that would increase the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions; an estimated increase for the nitrile group could be around +30\u00b0C. Summing these adjustments provides an estimated melting point: -78 (ammonia base) + 80 (first amine group) + 80 (second amine group) + 100 (guanidinium core) + 30 (nitrile group).",
