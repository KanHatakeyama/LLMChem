        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of -41.6\u00b0C. An ethyl group, when attached to the ring, tends to lower the melting point due to its ability to disrupt the crystalline structure and packing efficiency by providing more steric hindrance compared to a smaller methyl group. The effect of an ethyl group can be approximated to lower the melting point by about 50\u00b0C in this context.",
