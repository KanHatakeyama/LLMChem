        "Reason": "Basic unit, styrene has a melting point of -30.6 degrees Celsius. The addition of an amino group to the para position is expected to increase the melting point due to potential intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which increases the stability of the solid state. An amino group typically increases the melting point by about 40 to 70 degrees Celsius depending on the capacity to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and the molecular structure it interacts with. Given that styrene lacks hydrogen bond donors, the presence of an amino group should have a significant impact. However, since intermolecular interactions can vary significantly, a conservative estimate would be an increase of approximately 50 degrees Celsius.",
