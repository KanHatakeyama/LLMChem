        "Reason": "For buclosamide, we consider the basic unit, aniline, which has a melting point of around -6 degrees Celsius. Introducing a chloro substituent on the benzene ring generally increases the melting point by providing additional van der Waals forces and possible dipole interactions, which can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 40 degrees Celsius. The attachment of the butylamide group is expected to increase the melting point further due to the increase in molecular size and potential for hydrogen bonding, which we can estimate to contribute an additional 50 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group is known for its ability to form hydrogen bonds and generally steers the structure to be more rigid, which could contribute another 10 degrees Celsius. However, it is inherently part of the butylamide group's contribution and thus might not be additive on its own.",
