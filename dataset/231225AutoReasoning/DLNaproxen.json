        "Reason": "The target compound DL-Naproxen consists of a naphthalene ring as its basic unit, several substituents including a carboxylic acid group, a methyl group, and a methoxy group. For naphthalene, the melting point is approximately 80 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid group is known to significantly increase the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding, typically adding more than +50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group is a small alkyl substituent and might contribute a few degrees by increasing the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group can increase the melting point due to its polar nature and the possibility of additional dipole-dipole interactions, let's roughly estimate this effect at +15 degrees Celsius. Combining these effects leads to a predicted melting point for DL-Naproxen.",
