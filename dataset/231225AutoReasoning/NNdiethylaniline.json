        "Reason": "The melting point of aniline (the basic unit for N,N-diethylaniline) is approximately -6 degrees Celsius. The N,N-diethyl groups are expected to decrease the melting point due to the increasing bulk which disrupts the crystal lattice, making it more difficult to pack the molecules efficiently (let's estimate this effect at -20 degrees Celsius for each diethyl group). The aniline aromatic ring generally raises the melting point due to the ability of pi-pi stacking interaction, but this effect is already included in the aniline base value, so it is not counted twice.",
