        "Reason": "The compound 3-amino-2,2-dimethyl-1-propanol comprises several functional groups which influence its melting point. The basic unit of this compound can be considered as propanol which has a melting point of around -126.0 degrees Celsius. The amino group generally increases the melting point due to its ability to engage in hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +50 degrees to the base value. Two methyl groups increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and slightly bulkier structure which might add around +20 degrees each to the base value. However, these effects are not simple additive because the overall structure and intermolecular forces play a significant role. Since there are steric effects between the methyl groups and the amino and hydroxyl groups, the melting point might not increase as much as expected from smaller alcohols and amines. Therefore, the overall cumulative effect of the amino and hydroxyl groups is estimated to increase the melting point by +70 degrees, whereas the dimethyl groups add a total of +40 degrees but the steric hindrance reduces the effects by about -20 degrees.",
