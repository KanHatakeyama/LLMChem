        "Reason": "The base compound for our consideration could be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Adding a nitrile group (\u2013C\u2261N) typically increases the melting point due to increased polarity and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions, which could add roughly +40 \u00b0C. The introduction of a nitro group (\u2013NO2) to the benzene ring will also increase the melting point because of intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole attractions and potential hydrogen bonding to other molecules, which could add another +30 \u00b0C. However, the ortho-position of the nitro group can cause some steric hindrance that can slightly lower the melting point in comparison to para-substituted derivatives, so we might subtract around -5 \u00b0C for this effect.",

Adding a nitrile group (\u2013C\u2261N) to the structure can significantly increase the melting point because the cyano group introduces polarity and potential for strong dipole-dipole interactions due to the carbon-nitrogen triple bond, this could add approximately +70 \u00b0C to the melting point. The nitro group (\u2013NO2) is an electron-withdrawing group and also contributes to the overall polarity and introduces the possibility of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, albeit limited since it's not attached to a hydrogen itself. This could add about +50 \u00b0C due to these strong intermolecular attractions. The influence of the ortho position creating steric hindrance might be negligible in the case of melting point, or may slightly lower the melting point, but we would estimate this adjustment to be minor, around -5 \u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "For the compound (2-Nitrophenyl)acetonitrile, the basic unit we'll consider is benzene which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The functional groups that can influence this are the nitro group and the acetonitrile (cyano) group attached to the benzene ring. The nitro group is an electron-withdrawing group due to its high electronegativity and resonance effects, which generally increases intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, leading to a higher melting point. We can estimate this increase to be about +70\u00b0C for a nitro group on a benzene ring. The cyano group is also an electron-withdrawing group which can increase melting point due to polarity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions. The estimated increase for cyano group can be around +30\u00b0C. Both groups being meta to each other may have slight interacting effects, but we'll consider them to largely additively affect the melting point.",

Adding a nitro group to the benzene ring tends to significantly increase the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature and the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding, contributing to strong dipole-dipole interactions. While the quantitative increase for a nitro group can vary, an estimate of around +48\u00b0C for the melting point elevation due to a nitro substituent on a benzene ring is reasonable. The acetonitrile (cyano) group, being another electron-withdrawing group, also enhances the melting point by increasing polarity and dipole-dipole interactions. The estimated increase for a cyano group might be +30\u00b0C. Given that the groups are meta to each other, they likely have an additive effect rather than a synergistic or antagonistic interaction.",
