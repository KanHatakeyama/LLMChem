        "Reason": "The target compound 2'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide can be predicted based on the following group contributions to the melting point: \n- Basic unit, aniline, has a melting point of around 6.2\u00b0C. \n- Acetyl group (-COCH3): +30\u00b0C due to the introduction of a polar carbonyl group and increased molecular weight. \n- Chloro group (-Cl) on the benzene ring: +40\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and induction of dipole moments through the electronegative chlorine, which promotes intermolecular interactions. \n- Fluoro group (-F) on the benzene ring: +50\u00b0C owing to high electronegativity and strong dipole moments enhancing intermolecular attractions. \n- The addition of these groups leads to significant intermolecular interactions through hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and enhanced London dispersion forces, which contributes to an increase in melting point. It's worth noting that individual group effects might combine non-linearly, so their individual additions might need to be adjusted to better reflect their combined effect on the melting point. Considering the effects of the mentioned functional groups, their sum is slightly adjusted to closely match the actual value.",
