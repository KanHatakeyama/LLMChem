        "Reason": "The melting point of benzene is 5.5 degrees Celsius. The aldehyde group (-CHO) typically increases melting points due to its polar nature, which can allow for stronger dipole-dipole interactions. For benzene derivatives like benzoic acid, this effect can account for approximately +100 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom, being significantly larger and more polarizable than a hydrogen atom it replaces, can also increase the melting point due to the increased London dispersion forces. However, bromine's inductive effect could weaken the overall molecular packing, leading to a more modest increase than that of a smaller halogen. Estimating the combined effect, aldehyde might contribute with +80 degrees, and the bromine might contribute with +40 degrees.",

        "Reason": "The melting point of benzene is 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of an aldehyde group (-CHO) in benzaldehyde raises the melting point substantially, as it introduces a polar moiety that allows for stronger dipole-dipole interactions; with benzoic acid as a reference (a benzene derivative with a carboxylic acid group), the polar functional group can contribute to an increase of approximately +100 degrees Celsius. Although an aldehyde is slightly less polar than a carboxylic acid, its effect on the melting point could be estimated in a similar range. For the addition of a bromo substituent, which provides a bulky, electron-rich atom, the increase in van der Waals (London dispersion) forces typically contributes to a higher melting point. This effect might be estimated to be +30-40 degrees due to the size and polarizability of the bromine atom, although it may also introduce some steric hindrance that could influence molecular packing less predictably. Taking these effects into consideration and being conservative due to potential counteracting effects, the aldehyde group might contribute an increase of +80 degrees and the bromine atom an additional +30 degrees.",

        "Reason": "Starting with benzene as the basic unit, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, we consider the effects of the substituents. The addition of a bromine atom increases the molecular weight and provides some dipole interactions, so we can estimate this might increase the melting point by approximately 50 degrees Celsius. In contrast, the formyl group (C=O) typically results in stronger dipolar interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which would further increase the melting point; a reasonable estimate for this effect could be around 60 degrees Celsius. Both the bromine and formyl groups are ortho to each other, which might result in steric hindrance that slightly reduces the overall increase in melting point. Taking that into consideration, the combined effect could decrease the estimated increase by about 10 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the total predicted adjustment to the melting point would be +50 (Br) + 60 (C=O) - 10 (steric hindrance) = 100 degrees Celsius.",

        "Reason": "The base compound benzene has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The aldehyde group (-CHO) has the potential to increase melting point significantly because it can engage in hydrogen bonding, which contributes to a stronger intermolecular interaction and in turn raises the melting point. We can estimate this increase to be around 40 \u00b0C. A bromine atom further increases the melting point due to its large size and mass, which enhances intermolecular van der Waals forces. This is typically not as pronounced as hydrogen bonding, but it can still be significant, potentially contributing an additional 20 \u00b0C. When these effects are combined, the overall increase in melting point should be observable.",
