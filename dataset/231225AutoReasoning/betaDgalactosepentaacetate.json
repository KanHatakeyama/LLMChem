        "Reason": "The basic unit here is beta-D-galactose, which has a melting point of approximately 168\u00b0C without acetylation. The presence of acetyl groups typically lowers the melting point due to the reduction in hydrogen bonding compared to the hydroxyl groups they replace. Each acetyl group can be expected to lower the melting point significantly. Let's assign a decrement value of approximately -5\u00b0C for each acetate group. There are five acetate groups in beta-D-galactose pentaacetate. Therefore, 5 acetyl groups x -5\u00b0C each = -25\u00b0C total decrement from the base value of unmodified beta-D-galactose. Thus, the melting point would be expected to shift lower from the base galactose value. However, since the given actual value is 144\u00b0C, we need to adjust our per group decrement to align with the known melting point. Given the starting point of 168\u00b0C and ending at 144\u00b0C, that's a decrease of 24\u00b0C total, or approximately -4.8\u00b0C per acetyl group, which is close to our initial estimate.",
