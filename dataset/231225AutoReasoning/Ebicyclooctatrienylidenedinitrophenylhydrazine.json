        "Reason": "The compound given is a derivative of hydrazine with additional functional groups: a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1,3,5-triene moiety and two 2,4-dinitrophenyl groups. The basic unit of hydrazine has a melting point of 2 degrees Celsius. The bicyclooctatriene moiety is a rigid, fused ring system which will significantly increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and increased structural rigidity: +100 degrees. Each dinitrophenyl group adds aromaticity and electron-withdrawing nitro groups that stabilize the solid form through intermolecular forces, such as dipole interactions and possibly hydrogen bonding with the hydrazine nitrogen: +50 degrees for each dinitrophenyl group. There are two such groups, so this contribution is doubled. However, without experimental data for similar compounds, these effects are only approximate.",
