        "Reason": "The basic unit for 4-phenylquinuclidine can be thought of as quinuclidine, which has a melting point of around -100. However, adding a phenyl group significantly increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the addition of aromaticity, which contributes to stronger intermolecular forces. Phenyl group: approximately +200 due to its large influence on the melting point through aromatic interactions and van der Waals forces. Quinuclidine's structure includes a bridged bicyclic amine, which significantly contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, thus affecting the melting point compared to linear or simpler cyclic compounds. Bridged bicyclic structure: +24 (considering the increase in structural complexity and rigidity).",
