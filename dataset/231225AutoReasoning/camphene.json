        "Reason": "The basic units to consider for the compound (+)-camphene are: the bicyclic ring system, the isopropyl group, and the double bond. A single cyclohexane ring has an approximate melting point of around 6.5\u00b0C. The influence of the bicyclic ring system on the melting point will be significant due to the rigid structure providing a higher degree of crystal lattice energy, estimated at +40\u00b0C. The isopropyl group usually lowers the melting point compared to a simple alkane due to branching, estimated at -3\u00b0C. The presence of a double bond can also affect the melting point: in some cases, it might increase it slightly due to pi-pi stacking interactions, estimated at +2\u00b0C. However, since (+)-camphene has a strained and rigid bicyclic structure, the double bond's effect might be less pronounced. Combining these influences, the expected melting point change is approximately +39\u00b0C compared to a single cyclohexane ring.",
        "Prediction": "6.5 (cyclohexane) + 40 (bicyclic ring system) - 3 (isopropyl group) + 2 (double bond) = 45.5\u00b0C",
