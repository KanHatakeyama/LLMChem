        "Reason": "The target compound, 9-Phenanthrenecarboxylic acid, is composed of a phenanthrene core and a carboxylic acid group. Phenanthrene, the basic unit, has a melting point around 101\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group typically introduces hydrogen bonding which can significantly increase the melting point, and this can be estimated as a +150\u00b0C increment. Moreover, the rigid polycyclic structure of phenanthrene contributes to a higher melting point due to the increased stability and reduced molecular motion, adding approximately another +2\u00b0C.",
