        "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by various factors such as molecular weight, polarity, hydrogen bonding, and molecular structure stability. Starting with pyridine as the basic unit which has a melting point of -42 \u00b0C, the following functional group effects can be considered quantitatively: Chlorine substitution on the pyridine ring will increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and dipole moment; we may approximate this effect to be about +50 \u00b0C. The cyano group also strongly affects the melting point as it significantly increases molecular weight, molecular rigidity, and polarity. The cyano effect can also be estimated to be around +60 \u00b0C. However, these individual effects do not simply add linearly due to potential interactions and the overall molecular geometry. A combined estimation adjusting for these effects yields a predicted melting point.",
