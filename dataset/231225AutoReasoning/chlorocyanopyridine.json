        "Reason": "The basic unit pyridine has a melting point around -42 degree Celsius. Adding a chlorine substituent generally increases the melting point due to its relatively large size and its ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions (+50). The nitrile group also increases the melting point due to its high electronegativity and the potential for intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions (+65). These influences are additive because they do not interfere with each other's electronic effects on the molecule.",
