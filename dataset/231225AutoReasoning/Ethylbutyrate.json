        "Reason": "The compound ethyl butyrate contains an ester functional group (-COO-) which can engage in dipole-dipole interactions. The base unit for comparison will be butane (a straight-chain alkane with similar carbon length), which has a melting point of -138.3\u00b0C. The ethyl ester moiety adds to the rigidity and enhances the dipole-dipole interactions of the molecule compared to butane. For the sake of this exercise, the ester group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 45 degrees (a qualitative estimate based on increased polarity and molecular interactions).",
