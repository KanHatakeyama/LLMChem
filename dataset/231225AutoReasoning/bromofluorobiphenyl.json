        "Reason": "Starting from the basic unit biphenyl, which has a melting point around 69\u00b0C, we analyze the effects of the substituents. Fluorine introduces intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions and enhances the strength of Van der Waals forces due to its high electronegativity, so it generally increases the melting point; we can estimate this increase to be about +20\u00b0C. Bromine, on the other hand, being a larger halogen adds significant molecular weight which can also lead to stronger Van der Waals interactions, and thus a higher melting point; we might estimate an increase of +30\u00b0C for the bromine atom. However, considering that the melting point observed is lower than the base biphenyl, this implies that the spatial arrangement of these substituents disrupts the crystalline structure of biphenyl more than the strengthening effects of the substituents on intermolecular forces, thus leading to a lower melting point. We need to account for a major decrease that overcomes the increases given by the substituents. An estimated decrease could be around -79\u00b0C from the sum of both substituent additions.",
        "Prediction": "40\u00b0C. Calculated as 69\u00b0C (base biphenyl) + 20\u00b0C (fluorine) + 30\u00b0C (bromine) - 79\u00b0C (structural disruption effects) = 40\u00b0C",
