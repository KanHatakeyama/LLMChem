        "Reason": "The target compound, 2-acetylfluorene, can be decomposed into two main parts when considering its melting point: the fluorene base structure and the acetyl functional group. The basic fluorene unit has a melting point of 116\u00b0C. The influence of the acetyl group (COCH3) on the melting point can be analyzed in terms of its electron-withdrawing effect and its impact on the molecular symmetry and rigidity. The carbonyl group (C=O) adds polarity and is able to form hydrogen bonds, which generally increases melting points. However, 2-acetylfluorene does not have available NH or OH groups for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which limits this effect. The acetyl group does introduce additional rigidity to the molecule, which tends to increase the melting point. Estimation of the acetyl contribution to the melting point is tricky, but we can assume it's in the range of 10-20\u00b0C added to the base fluorene unit due to the reasons stated. Thus, the estimated melting point contribution from the acetyl group is taken as +14\u00b0C.",
