        "Reason": "The basic unit, cyclohexanone, has a melting point of -47.5\u00b0C. Adding a phenyl group to the cyclohexanone increases the molecular weight and rigidity of the molecule, and introduces \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, which together will raise the melting point. The phenyl group can typically have a relatively large impact on the melting point due to these effects, so we can estimate this contribution to be around +100 to +130\u00b0C. Combining this with the basic cyclohexanone unit gives an expected melting point.",

Adding a phenyl group to the cyclohexanone increases the molecular weight and rigidity of the molecule, and introduces \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, which increase the intermolecular forces, hence raising the melting point. Typically, the addition of a phenyl group can significantly influence the melting point due to steric effects and enhanced intermolecular forces, especially \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, which are significant in solid state. Considering the impact of the phenyl group, a rough estimation for its contribution to the melting point of a compound like cyclohexanone can be around +127 to +130\u00b0C due to these factors. Therefore, adding this to the basic unit's melting point gives a predicted value for the melting point of 4-phenylcyclohexanone.",
