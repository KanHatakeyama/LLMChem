        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of around -42 \u00b0C. The amino group typically raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can be estimated to add about +100 \u00b0C. Each chloro substituent can be expected to raise the melting point as well, due to an increase in the molecular weight and van der Waals forces; let's estimate that at +30 \u00b0C for each chloro substituent. However, the overall symmetry and conjugation of the molecule can also affect the melting point but have not been quantitatively considered in this prediction.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of around 42 \u00b0C. The introduction of an amino group can lead to increased hydrogen bonding, significantly raising the melting point by approximately +80 \u00b0C. Each chloro substituent will contribute to a higher melting point due to increased molecular weight and enhanced van der Waals interactions; this effect is estimated at about +25 \u00b0C per chloro group. Taking into account these substituent effects without considering the potential disruptiveness of the chloro groups on the overall symmetry and crystal packing, which are harder to predict quantitatively without detailed analysis.",
