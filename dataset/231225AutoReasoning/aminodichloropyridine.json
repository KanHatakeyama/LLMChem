        "Reason": "Starting with pyridine as the basic unit, which has a melting point of \u221242 \u00b0C, the introduction of various functional groups will alter this value. Each chlorine atom adds approximately +40 \u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and enhanced polar interactions. The amino group generally increases the melting point by around +80 \u00b0C, since it can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, significantly enhancing the melting point. Given these contributions, the combined effect of the two chlorine atoms would be +80 \u00b0C, and the amino group would contribute +80\u00b0C. Therefore, the total expected increase in melting point would be +160 \u00b0C when added to the base melting point of pyridine.",

The amino group typically increases the melting point due to potential for hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point significantly (estimate +30). Each chlorine atom introduces more mass and also enhances the melting point due to Van der Waals forces and possible inductive effects, stabilizing the crystal lattice (estimate +8 for each chlorine).",
