        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be pyrazine, which has a melting point around 55 \u00b0C. Each chlorine substituent on the quinoxaline typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight, polarity, and possible intermolecular interactions, such as dipole-dipole attractions and hydrogen bonding with trace water. The presence of two chlorines could be expected to raise the melting point significantly. A single chlorine on an aromatic ring might raise the melting point by approximately 40-50 \u00b0C. So, for two chlorines the increment might be twice of this, leading to an increase of about 80-100 \u00b0C over the base pyrazine melting point.",
