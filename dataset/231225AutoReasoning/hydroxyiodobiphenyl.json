        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound can be considered as biphenyl, which has a melting point of around 70\u00b0C. The presence of a hydroxy group (-OH) is generally associated with an increase in the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which requires more energy to break. This can typically raise the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. The iodine substituent is a heavy atom which may also increase the melting point due to the increased Van der Waals interactions, which can be estimated at around +8\u00b0C increase. However, the hydroxy and iodine are in para positions relative to each other; this symmetry might not allow for the maximum impact on the melting point compared to if they were ortho or meta to each other.",
