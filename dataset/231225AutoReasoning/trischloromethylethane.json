        "Reason": "The base unit for the compound is ethane, which has a melting point of -183 degrees Celsius. The three chloromethyl groups attached to the central carbon replace hydrogen atoms and will each influence the melting point. Each chloromethyl group brings three elements with it: chlorine which is highly electronegative, and adds polar character, and two carbon atoms which increase the molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The influence of a chlorine atom on melting point would approximately be +40 degrees Celsius due to increased polarity and intermolecular forces. However, this increase is partly negated by the methyl group's inductive effect slightly lowering melting point by an estimated -5, resulting in a net effect of +35 per chloromethyl group. As we have three such groups, the cumulative effect is 3 x 35 = +105 degrees Celsius. Adding this cumulative effect to the base melting point of ethane would predict the melting point of the target compound.",
