        "Reason": "The target compound, Heptan-3-one, is a seven-carbon ketone. The basic unit to compare with could be heptane, which has a melting point of -90.6 \u00b0C. The presence of the carbonyl group (C=O) adds polarity to the molecule, reducing the melting point compared to non-polar alkanes. For a ketone, we can estimate that the polar carbonyl functional group raises the melting point relative to the equivalent alkane by approximately 30-50 degrees. Thus, we can estimate the increase due to the carbonyl group being in a more positive direction from heptane's melting point, but it would not exceed the increase of the maximum estimated contribution of 50 degrees.",
