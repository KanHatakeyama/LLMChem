        "Reason": "The basic unit for 1H-pyrazole has a melting point of around 70 degrees Celsius. The presence of three methyl groups increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, and typically, each methyl group can raise the melting point by approximately 20-30 degrees Celsius. Given that there are three methyl groups, the cumulative effect would be a rise in the melting point by 60-90 degrees Celsius when added to the base value for pyrazole.",
