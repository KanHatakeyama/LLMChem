        "Reason": "The base unit for tranylcypromine could be cyclohexane, which has a melting point of approximately 6.5 degrees Celsius. The benzene ring typically raises the melting point due to its rigid structure and pi-stacking interactions, which could add around +40 degrees. However, the primary amine in tranylcypromine can engage in hydrogen bonding with different molecules, potentially lowering the melting point by around -25 degrees as amine groups can lead to an increase in polarity and interactions with other polar molecules, which can destabilize the crystal structure. The two carbon bridge links the benzene and amine groups, which doesn't add significant steric hindrance but does make the molecule more rigid, potentially adding another +5 degrees due to restricted rotation around the bridge contributing to crystal stability.",

        "Reason": "The base unit for tranylcypromine can be considered as cyclohexane, which has a melting point of approximately 6.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of a benzene ring to form a cyclohexylbenzene structure would typically result in an increase in melting point due to the introduction of pi-stacking interactions and an overall more rigid structure; this could be estimated to add around +50 degrees. The primary amine (-NH2) has the capability to form hydrogen bonds, which generally increases the melting point as molecules can pack more efficiently in the solid state; this could be estimated to raise the melting point by around +15 degrees, considering the influence of hydrogen bonding in other primary amines. Finally, the two-carbon bridge does indeed make the molecule more rigid, which could contribute to crystal stability and a slightly higher melting point, say an additional +5 degrees. These effects combined give an estimated melting point of 6.5 (base) + 50 (benzene-induced rigidity) + 15 (primary amine hydrogen bonding) + 5 (rigidity from two-carbon bridge) = 76.5 degrees Celsius.",
