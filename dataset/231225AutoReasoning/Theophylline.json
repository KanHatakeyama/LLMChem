        "Reason": "Theophylline, using the basic scaffolding of purine (melting point of around 214 \u00b0C for adenine), is modified by several functional groups that influence its melting point: Two keto groups: each typically raises the melting point due to the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipolar interactions. Assuming each keto group could contribute roughly +20 degrees. One tertiary amine: may have a comparatively mild effect on the melting point; tertiary amines are less likely to engage in hydrogen bonding than primary or secondary amines. Therefore the change due to the tertiary amine might be minimal, estimated at around +5 degrees. Two nitrogen atoms in the ring structure (imidazole-like): increases the rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing perhaps +10 degrees for each nitrogen. Considering all functional groups, the cumulative effect on the melting point would be an increase.",

Each keto group likely contributes to an increased melting point by about +20 \u00b0C. A tertiary amine typically has less of a pronounced effect on the melting point compared to primary or secondary amines due to its reduced hydrogen bonding capacity. The effect of the tertiary amine is estimated to be around +5 \u00b0C. The presence of two nitrogen atoms within the ring structure adds to the rigidity of the molecule and enhances the potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +10 \u00b0C for each nitrogen atom. Taking all these functional group effects into account, the prediction for the cumulative increase in melting point should be reflected in the sum of these contributions.",

The actual effect might be greater given the added rigidity and planarity of the purine system, which can further enhance intermolecular stacking interactions that stabilize the solid form. It has two carbonyl groups which typically contribute to higher melting points through hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions: let's assign +20 for each carbonyl group. It also has one methyl group attached to a nitrogen, which might give a smaller increase due to the larger molecular size and slight increase in van der Waals interactions: let's put this at +7.",

The basic structure of xanthine has a melting point of approximately 237\u00b0C. Each functional group's contribution to the melting point can be estimated separately: the ketone groups (C=O) are strongly polar and can engage in hydrogen bonding, thereby significantly raising the melting point collectively by an estimated 40\u00b0C. The amine groups (N-CH3) introduce steric hindrance and provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point by approximately 15\u00b0C. The imidazole ring (part of the purine structure) also contributes to the stability and the rigidity of the molecule, which is expected to raise the melting point, but to a less extent than polar functional groups. We estimate this contribution to be around 5\u00b0C.",
