        "Reason": "The basic units to consider here are butane and acetate (acetic acid ester). The normal boiling point of butane is around -0.5 degrees Celsius. The acetate group (from acetic acid with a boiling point of about 118 degrees Celsius) will increase the melting point due to its polar nature and possibility of hydrogen bonding, we could estimate this increase to be +50 degrees Celsius. The 3-methyl group will add some steric bulk and slightly larger molecular weight, which tends to increase the boiling point due to greater van der Waals forces; this could be estimated as +5 degrees Celsius. However, the branching decreases melting point compared to straight-chain isomers due to less efficient packing, we will account a small reduction of about -5 Celsius.",

        "Reason": "The base component to consider here is the butane backbone, which has a melting point of approximately -135 degrees Celsius. The ester functional group (acetyl, similar to acetic acid with a melting point of 16.6 degrees Celsius) is a polar group that can increase the melting point due to its capacity for dipole-dipole interactions; this can be estimated to contribute about +40 degrees Celsius. The 3-methyl group adds some steric bulk and a modest increase in molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces; this contribution can be estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. However, the branching introduced by the 3-methyl group might slightly reduce the melting point compared to straight-chain compounds due to less efficient packing; we could estimate this reduction to be about -5 Celsius. Therefore, combining these adjustments, we would predict a melting point shift.",
