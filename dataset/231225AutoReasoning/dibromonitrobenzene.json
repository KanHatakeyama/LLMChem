        "Reason": "Let's analyze the impact of different functional groups on the basic benzene structure. The basic benzene has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The 1,4-dibromo substitution would introduce significant mass to the molecule and increase intermolecular forces such as London dispersion forces due to the relatively large bromine atoms, which should significantly increase the melting point. Each bromine substitution could increase the melting point by about +70 \u00b0C. The nitro group is a strongly electron-withdrawing group and can engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding with other molecules due to the presence of oxygen atoms, which potentially increases the melting point further. The nitro group is estimated to raise the melting point by another +50 \u00b0C. These adjustments are cumulative. Therefore, we have the contributions as follows: basic benzene (+5.5), bromine substitutions (2x+70), and nitro group (+50).",

        "Reason": "Starting with the basic benzene structure, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, the introduction of two bromine atoms on the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring adds significant molecular weight and increases the London dispersion forces, which can be estimated to increase the melting point substantially. Each bromine might contribute an estimated +30 \u00b0C due to their size and the increase in dispersion forces. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which contributes to intermolecular forces, especially dipole-dipole interactions. The nitro group can also form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of oxygen atoms, which could potentially raise the melting point. However, the contribution of a nitro group is typically less than that of a bromine atom in terms of melting point elevation; thus, an estimated increase of +20 \u00b0C from the nitro group is reasonable. Combining these adjustments to the base melting point of benzene, we have: basic benzene (+5.5), bromine substitutions (2x+30), and nitro group (+20).",
