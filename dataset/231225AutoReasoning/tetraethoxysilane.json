        "Reason": "The basic unit of tetraethoxysilane, silicon dioxide, has a very high melting point (over 1600 degrees Celsius) due to its strong silicon-oxygen covalent network structure. However, the replacement of the oxygen atoms that normally participate in the network with long-chain ethoxy groups (CH3CH2O-) drastically reduces the ability to form a network, thereby significantly lowering the melting point. Each ethoxy group likely decreases the melting point due to increased molecular volume which interferes with close packing and reduced intermolecular forces compared to the Si-O network. Assuming approximately -100 degrees Celsius decrease for each ethoxy group (extrapolating from common alkoxysilanes), we can estimate the change. In this prediction, we will use -100 as a rough estimate for the change in melting point per ethoxy group. Silicon dioxide has a melting point around 1600 degrees Celsius. With four ethoxy groups, the estimated decrease would be approximately 400 degrees Celsius, which should render the melting point well below 0 degrees Celsius.",
