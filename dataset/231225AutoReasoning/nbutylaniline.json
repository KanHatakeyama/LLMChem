        "Reason": "n-Butylaniline is composed of aniline as the base structure and an n-butyl group attached to the nitrogen atom. The basic aniline structure has a melting point of around -6 degrees Celsius. The n-butyl group, which is a straight hydrocarbon chain, is expected to lower the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and volume. Usually, alkyl chains can decrease the melting point of an aromatic compound by reducing the ability for the molecules to efficiently pack in the solid state. This is due to the increased entropy of the molecule resulting from the alkyl chain's rotational freedom. For each methylene group (CH2), we can estimate an average decrease in melting point by about 2 to 3 degrees Celsius.",
