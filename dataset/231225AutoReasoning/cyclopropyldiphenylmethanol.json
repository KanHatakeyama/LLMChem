        "Reason": "The base compound, cyclohexane, has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. For the cyclopropyl group: -20\u00b0C due to strain in the ring decreasing intermolecular forces; for each phenyl group, add 30\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and pi-stacking interactions providing greater intermolecular forces; for the hydroxyl group, add 40\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding. These values are approximate and the actual effect may be smaller or larger based on the specific molecular conformation and interactions between groups. The impact of the combination of these groups may not be strictly additive due to possible steric hindrance or altered molecular geometry, but for the purpose of this prediction we will consider the effects as additive.",
