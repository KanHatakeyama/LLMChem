        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound can be taken as pyridine, which has a melting point of around -42\u00b0C due to its aromaticity and nitrogen heteroatom. Each fluorine atom introduces strong electronegativity and inductive effect, increasing intermolecular attractions. We estimate each fluorine to add approximately 32\u00b0C due to its electron-withdrawing nature and the strong dipole-dipole interactions it can foster. The amino group (-NH2) is likely to contribute to hydrogen bonding, but given the electronegative environment it's in, this effect might be mitigated; we can estimate an increase of about 6\u00b0C for the amino group. So the total estimated increase would be 32\u00b0C x 4 (for four fluorines) + 6\u00b0C for the amino group.",
        "Prediction": "Pyridine base melting point: -42\u00b0C\nFluorine adjustments: 32\u00b0C x 4 = 128\u00b0C\nAmino group adjustment: +6\u00b0C\nTotal predicted melting point: -42 + 128 + 6 = 92\u00b0C",
