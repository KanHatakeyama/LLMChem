        "Reason": "The base structure for our prediction is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, also known as norcamphor, which has a melting point of around 76 degrees Celsius. We need to consider the effects of the additional substituents:\n- Hydroxy(phenyl)amino substituent: This introduces hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight and rigidity to the molecular structure. Each aromatic ring typically increases the melting point by about 20 degrees due to pi-stacking interactions and the amino group add about 10 due to hydrogen bonding capacity, in total we estimate an increase by about 30 degrees.\n- Methylidene group attached to the cyclic structure: This can slightly increase the melting point due to increased rigidity and molecular weight, estimated increase by about 5 degrees.\n- Two additional methyl groups on the cyclohexane ring: Each methyl group contributes by increasing the melting point slightly due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance, estimated increase by about 2 degrees each, total of 4 degrees.\nThus, overall estimated increase is 30 + 5 + 4 = 39 degrees.",
