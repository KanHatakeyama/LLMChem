        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of -42 degrees Celsius. The 2-propyl group is an alkyl substituent that can increase the melting point through an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The propyl group can raise the melting point by approximately 40 to 50 units due to added molecular complexity and bulkiness.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point for 2-propylpyridine would be -2 to 8 degrees Celsius, based on adding the effect of the propyl group to the basic pyridine unit.",
        "Prediction(integer)": 3.0
