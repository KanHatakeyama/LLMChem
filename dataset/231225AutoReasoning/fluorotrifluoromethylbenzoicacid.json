        "Reason": "Benzoic acid is the basic unit with a melting point of 122. The fluorine substituent on the benzene ring will increase the melting point due to the inductive effect which strengthens the intermolecular forces, we can estimate this effect to be approximately +20. However, the trifluoromethyl group has both a strong inductive effect and a bulky structure, which can increase the melting point due to increased molecular mass and size, and strong electron-withdrawing effects, but it can also decrease the melting point due to steric hindrance that destabilizes the crystal structure; we can estimate a net increase of about +30 for the -CF3 group. Overall, we should subtract some melting point due to the compound being more complex and potentially causing some destabilization in the crystal lattice, let's estimate this decrease to be around -57.",
