        "Reason": "The basic unit to compare with might be glucose, since miglustat resembles a modified glucose molecule; glucose has a melting point of about 146 degrees Celsius. The following changes are present in miglustat: (1) a hydroxyl group at position 2 is replaced by a nitrogen-containing six-membered ring. Replacing a hydroxy group with a more complex, heterocyclic ring system could potentially heighten the melting point due to additional van der Waals forces and possible hydrogen bonding, let's approximate this increase to be around +20 degrees Celsius. (2) The nitrogen substituent includes butyl chains (propyl + methyl) which should raise the melting point slightly due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; let's estimate the butyl effect to be +5 degrees Celsius for the propyl part and +2 for the methyl part. Summing the effects gives an increase of 27 degrees Celsius to the base melting point of glucose.",
