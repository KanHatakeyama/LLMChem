        "Reason": "The compound 1,2-benzenedicarboxamide contains a benzene ring and two amide groups. The benzene ring serves as the basic structural unit, which in benzene itself has a melting point of approximately 5.5\u00b0C. Amide groups are known to significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to form strong hydrogen bonds, both intermolecularly and intramolecularly, and also due to resonance stabilization of the amide bond which increases rigidity. Each amide group could be estimated to increase the melting point by about 100\u00b0C due to these strong interactions. Since there are two amide groups, this effect is doubled.",

The presence of two amide groups contributes to a significantly higher melting point compared to benzene, due to their strong hydrogen bonding capabilities and the resonance stabilization of the amide bond which increases the compound's rigidity. Considering the impact of each amide group on the melting point, estimated at an increase of about 108.25\u00b0C for each group, the total effect of the two amide groups would result in an increase of approximately 216.5\u00b0C above the base melting point of benzene.",
