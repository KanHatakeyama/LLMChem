        "Reason": "Carbohydrazide has several functional groups that contribute to its melting point: the carbonyl group (C=O) and two hydrazide groups (-NN). The basic unit, urea, has a melting point of 133\u00b0C. The carbonyl group generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Each hydrazide group should increase the melting point compared to urea due to the presence of N-H bonds, which can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The carbonyl group can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 10-20\u00b0C compared to urea, based on similar compounds, and each hydrazide group may contribute a similar increase of roughly 10-15\u00b0C due to additional hydrogen bonding capacity.",

        "Reason": "Carbohydrazide contains a carbonyl group and two hydrazide groups that influence its melting point. Starting with urea, which has a melting point of 133\u00b0C, we can estimate the effects of these functional groups. The carbonyl group in carbohydrazide is capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds due to its polar nature and the hydrogen bond acceptor oxygen, typically increasing the melting point by about 10-20\u00b0C. Each hydrazide group (-NN) adds to the potential for hydrogen bonding due to the presence of N-H bonds. Given the structure of carbohydrazide, we would expect each hydrazide group to contribute an increase slightly less than the carbonyl group, so around 5-10\u00b0C per hydrazide. Therefore, we estimate the total increase in the melting point to be from the sum of these contributions over the base melting point of urea.",
