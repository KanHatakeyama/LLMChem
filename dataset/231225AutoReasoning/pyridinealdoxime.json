        "Reason": "The base unit for 4-pyridinealdoxime is pyridine, which has a melting point of 115.5\u00b0C. The oxime group (C=NOH) tends to increase the melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding capability (+20\u00b0C). However, the conjugation effect of the -CH=NOH group potentially reduces the melting point slightly (-4\u00b0C) due to stabilizing the planar structure and delocalizing electrons which might make the crystal lattice less rigid. Hence, the predicted shift would be an increase of roughly 16\u00b0C from the base pyridine melting point.",
