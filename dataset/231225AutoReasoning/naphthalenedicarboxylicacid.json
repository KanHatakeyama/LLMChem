        "Reason": "The basic unit, naphthalene, has a melting point of about 80\u00b0C. Each carboxylic acid functional group on naphthalene raises the melting point due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and due to the increase in polarity. Additionally, each carboxylic acid adds the possibility for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can significantly increase the melting point. The compound has two carboxylic acid groups, so the increase is substantial. The effect of one carboxylic acid group might raise the melting point by approximately 90\u00b0C, considering the influence of both hydrogen bonding capability and the polarity it introduces.",
