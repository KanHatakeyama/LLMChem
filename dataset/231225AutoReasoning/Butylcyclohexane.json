        "Reason": "The basic unit for the target compound, butylcyclohexane, is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. The butyl group is an alkyl chain that generally decreases melting point due to an increase in the molecule's overall size and flexibility, which tends to disrupt the crystal lattice, making it easier to melt. For the butyl group, this effect can be estimated as -5\u00b0C per methylene group in the chain. The butyl group has four such methylene groups contributing to this effect, resulting in a decrease of approximately -20\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The base structure for the target compound, butylcyclohexane, is cyclohexane, with a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. Attaching a butyl group (an alkyl chain) to cyclohexane generally lowers the melting point, as alkyl chains increase the molecular size and flexibility, disrupting the crystalline structure and easing the transition to the liquid state. Each methylene (-CH2-) unit in an alkyl chain typically lowers the melting point by about 18.75\u00b0C, judging from the difference between the melting points of methane (-182\u00b0C) and ethane (-172\u00b0C), as a rough approximation. Given that the butyl group adds four such methylene units, the estimated cumulative effect would be -75\u00b0C.",
