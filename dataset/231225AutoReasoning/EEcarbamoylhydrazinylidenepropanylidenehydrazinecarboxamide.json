        "Reason": "To predict the melting point for (2E)-2-[(1E)-1-(2-carbamoylhydrazinylidene)propan-2-ylidene]hydrazinecarboxamide, several functional groups and structural features must be quantitatively considered: \n- Basic unit, urea has a melting point of 133 degrees Celsius. Urea has strong hydrogen bonding capabilities due to its two amide groups, which significantly raises the melting point. \n- Additional amide groups: Each amide group contributes to the melting point through increased hydrogen bonding, estimated at +40 degrees Celsius per additional amide group, giving a total of +80 degrees (2 additional amide groups). \n- Hydrazide linkages (HC=N-NH): These could similarly increase the melting point because of their hydrogen bonding potential and rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius per linkage, giving a total of +40 degrees (2 hydrazine linkages). \n- Aromaticity and planarity are not taken into account since the compound does not seem to have aromatic rings based on the SMILES string. \n- Considering these effects cumulatively provides the estimated melting point.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point of (2E)-2-[(1E)-1-(2-carbamoylhydrazinylidene)propan-2-ylidene]hydrazinecarboxamide is 133 (urea base) + 80 (additional amide groups) + 40 (hydrazine linkages) = 253 degrees Celsius.",
