        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison will be benzofuran which has a melting point of 22 degrees Celsius. The addition of four chloro groups to the dibenzofuran core will significantly affect the melting point. Each chloro substituent, due to its electron-withdrawing and heavy nature, increases intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole attractions and potentially van der Waals forces), and thus the rigidity and stability of the molecule. We can estimate each chloro group to add approximately 40 degrees to the melting point (a rough estimation based on chlorination of aromatic compounds increasing melting points substantially). Hence, adding 4 chloro groups we estimate an increase of 160 degrees.",
