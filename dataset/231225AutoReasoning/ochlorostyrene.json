        "Reason": "The target compound, o-chlorostyrene, has a basic unit of styrene which is a vinylbenzene and has a melting point around -30.6\u00b0C. The addition of a chlorine substituent will have several effects. Being an electronegative substituent, the chlorine will increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole interactions (+20\u00b0C). However, it also introduces steric strain due to its larger size when ortho to the vinyl group which can slightly lower the melting point (-5\u00b0C). Considering both effects, the overall predicted change would be an increase of about +15\u00b0C relative to the basic styrene unit.",
