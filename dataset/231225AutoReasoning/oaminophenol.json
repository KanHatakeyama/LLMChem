        "Reason": "The target compound o-aminophenol consists of a benzene ring as its basic unit, which when taken alone has a melting point of approximately 5.5\u00b0C (the melting point of unsubstituted benzene). Adding an amino group (-NH2) to the benzene ring will generally increase the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding and an increase in molecular polarity; this can be estimated to raise the melting point by about +80\u00b0C. An adjacent hydroxyl group (-OH) will also lead to increased hydrogen bonding and molecular polarity. Given the close proximity to the amino group (ortho position), this could allow for intramolecular hydrogen bonding which stabilizes the solid structure even more, raising the melting point. The hydroxyl group's contribution to the melting point could be estimated at +90\u00b0C, considering the substantial impact of hydrogen bonding and its ability to strongly affect the melting point. Combining the contributions from the amino and hydroxyl groups, we estimate an overall increase in the melting point of 170\u00b0C compared to unsubstituted benzene.",
