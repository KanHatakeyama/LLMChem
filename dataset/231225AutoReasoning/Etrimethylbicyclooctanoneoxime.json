        "Reason": "The compound (2E)-1,8,8-trimethylbicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-one oxime has several features affecting its melting point: the bicyclic structure, which increases the rigidity of the molecule and thereby its melting point; the trimethyl groups, which add steric hindrance and increase the molecular weight; and the oxime functional group, which provides the ability to form hydrogen bonds that also raises the melting point. In comparison to cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius, the bicyclic structure contributes significantly more rigidity, possibly adding around +50 degrees. Each trimethyl group adds steric bulk and weight, contributing approximately +5 degrees per group. The oxime group's hydrogen bonding capability can contribute an estimated +30 degrees. Hence, the combined effect would be: cyclohexane (6.5) + bicyclic structure (+50) + three trimethyl groups (3x5 = +15) + oxime group (+30) = 101.5 degrees Celsius.",

        "Reason": "The calculation starts from the basic structure of cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius, but the actual compound contains significant structural modifications. First, we consider the bicyclic structure [bicyclo[3.2.1]octane] which provides a substantial increase in rigidity compared to single ring compounds, this could be estimated to add approximately +80 degrees due to the increased intermolecular forces and decreased freedom of movement. Each trimethyl group increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which can be estimated to add around +10 degrees per group to the melting point. The oxime functional group is capable of hydrogen bonding, a strong intermolecular force, which raises the melting point. This effect can be significant and for simplicity, let's estimate this increases the melting point by about +40 degrees due to both hydrogen bonding and the polar nature of the group. The sum effect would be: base cyclohexane melting point (6.5) + bicyclic structure (+80) + three trimethyl groups (3x10 = +30) + oxime group (+40) = 156.5 degrees Celsius.",
