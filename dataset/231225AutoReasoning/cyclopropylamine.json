        "Reason": "The basic unit, cyclopropane, has a melting point around -126.8 \u00b0C. The introduction of an amine group to form cyclopropylamine increases the polarity of the molecule and provides the potential for hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point. An alkyl amine typically increases the melting point by approximately 70-90\u00b0C compared to its parent hydrocarbon, due to hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight.",
