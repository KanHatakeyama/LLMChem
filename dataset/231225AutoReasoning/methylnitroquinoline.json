        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 2-methyl-6-nitroquinoline, we'll quantitatively consider the effects of each functional group based on a basic quinoline structure. A simple quinoline has a melting point of around 76\u00b0C. For the methyl group attached to the quinoline, we can add about 5\u00b0C due to the slight increase in molecular weight and Van der Waals forces. The nitro group usually increases the melting point significantly, due to its ability to form strong intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding. We can estimate this increment to be around 80\u00b0C for the nitro group. Adding these together, we estimate an increase of 85\u00b0C to the base quinoline melting point.",
        "Prediction": "76 (base quinoline) + 5 (methyl group) + 80 (nitro group) = 161\u00b0C",
