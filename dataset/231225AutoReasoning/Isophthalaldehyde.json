        "Reason": "The target compound isophthalaldehyde consists of a benzene ring with two formyl groups (\u2013CHO) attached in the meta position. To predict its melting point, we take the basic unit benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the formyl groups influences the melting point in several ways. First, they increase molecular weight and rigidity, which typically increase the melting point. Second, the carbonyl group can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, which provide additional intermolecular forces. Lastly, the meta-substitution pattern maintains the symmetry of the molecule, possibly favoring a more ordered solid state. Each formyl group is expected to raise the melting point. If we assume the addition of each \u2013CHO group increases the melting point by around 40\u00b0C, we would have a total addition of 80\u00b0C to the melting point of benzene.",

Benzene as the basic unit has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The formyl groups increase the melting point due to the introduction of greater molecular weight, additional rigidity, and the ability for carbonyl groups to engage in dipole-dipole interactions, enhancing the intermolecular forces. Furthermore, the meta substitution of the formyl groups may support a more crystalline and ordered structure, likely leading to a higher melting point. Quantitatively, if we estimate that each formyl group increases the melting point by approximately 41\u00b0C, we account for the influence of both formyl groups on benzene's base melting point.",
