        "Reason": "Starting with methane as the basic unit with a melting point of -182.5 \u00b0C, the addition of chlorines and fluorine alters the melting point primarily due to increased molecular weight and the development of stronger intermolecular forces namely London dispersion forces and dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine atom adds approximately +30 \u00b0C due to its electronegativity and polarizability adding to the van der Waals forces, and the single fluorine atom adds about +5 \u00b0C because while it is highly electronegative, it's smaller and less polarizable than chlorine. Hence, the overall expected increase in melting point attributed to the substitution of three hydrogens with chlorines would be +90 \u00b0C, and +5 \u00b0C for the substitution of one hydrogen with fluorine.",

        "Reason": "Starting from the basic unit methane with a melting point of -182.5 \u00b0C, the introduction of three chlorine atoms significantly increases the melting point. Each chlorine atom, due to its larger size and greater polarizability compared to hydrogen, contributes to stronger London dispersion forces and also adds some dipole-dipole interactions due to their decent electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +24 \u00b0C for each chlorine. The fluorine atom, being smaller but more electronegative than chlorine, increases the melting point to a lesser extent; we can estimate a +10 \u00b0C change due to its influence on the polarity and intermolecular forces. Thus, the overall effect of three chlorines is +72 \u00b0C and the fluorine contributes +10 \u00b0C to the melting point.",

Adding a chlorine atom increases the boiling point due to the additional molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces, such as London dispersion forces. Each chlorine atom raises the boiling point significantly. A fluorine atom adds less to the molecular weight and has a smaller effect on the boiling point compared to chlorine. However, by examining similar compounds, the effect of each chlorine atom can be estimated as +40\u00b0C due to the much heavier molecular weight and stronger van der Waals forces. The fluorine atom contributes roughly +5\u00b0C, since it adds to the molecular weight and slightly increases the polarity of the molecule.",

The addition of chlorine atoms significantly raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the stronger van der Waals (London dispersion) forces that come with the larger, more electron-rich chlorine atoms. Each chlorine atom can be estimated to increase the melting point by about +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom, being smaller than chlorine, would have a less pronounced effect. It can increase the melting point by around +7\u00b0C due to its electronegativity, which leads to stronger dipole-dipole interactions, despite its lower molecular weight compared to chlorine.
