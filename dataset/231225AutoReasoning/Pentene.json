For each additional carbon in a straight-chain alkane, the melting point tends to increase due to increased Van der Waals forces from the greater surface area. Each methylene unit (CH2) typically adds about 20 to the melting point. However, the introduction of a double bond in an alkene like pent-1-ene lowers the symmetry of the molecule and can slightly reduce the melting point due to less efficient packing in the solid state. For a double bond, this reduction might be around 5. Hence, starting from methane: -182.5 + (4 additional carbons * 20) - 5 for the double bond.",
