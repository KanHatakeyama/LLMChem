        "Reason": "The basic unit ethane has a melting point of -172 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene (CH2) group in a linear alkane chain generally increases the melting point by approximately 20 degrees Celsius due to increased van der Waals forces. Thus adding five CH2 groups to ethane would raise the melting point by about 100 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the terminal thiol (SH) group increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, which is a strong intermolecular force. We can estimate the influence of the SH group to be about 30 degrees Celsius. So the total predicted increase would be approximately 130 degrees Celsius from the base value of -172 degrees Celsius for ethane.",
