        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The structure of naphthalene is essentially two benzene rings fused together. Fusion of rings usually leads to an increase in the melting point due to the greater rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which increases intermolecular forces. The presence of deuterium (heavy hydrogen, ~2~H) instead of ordinary hydrogen can affect the melting point in a subtle way, typically making the bonds slightly stronger due to the higher mass leading to lower zero-point energy. The impact of deuterium substitution on the melting point, however, is generally quite small, on the order of a few degrees at most. Since we have multiple deuterium atoms, we will estimate a small increase for each deuterium. If we predict a slight increase per deuterium, say +0.5\u00b0C, with 8 deuterium atoms, we would have an additional +4\u00b0C. The fusion of the two rings would have a much more significant effect; we can estimate that impact as a +70\u00b0C increase over benzene. However, since naphthalene without the deuterium has a melting point around 80\u00b0C, the significant increase is already observed due to the fused ring structure, so we only need to adjust for deuterium effect from the known value of normal naphthalene.",
