        "Reason": "The basic unit for 4'-hydroxyacetophenone is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The acetyl group (COCH3) typically raises the melting point due to the introduction of polar carbonyl bond and enhances intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions: +40\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group (-OH) also increases the melting point significantly due to the capability of forming hydrogen bonds: +60\u00b0C. These two effects are partially cumulative, but there may be some offset due to steric hindrance between the groups which is a modest effect: -5\u00b0C.",
