        "Reason": "Hexacosane is a long-chain hydrocarbon with 26 carbon atoms. The basic unit in this context can be taken as ethane, which has a melting point of -183\u00b0C. The increase in chain length increases the van der Waals forces, thus increasing the melting point. An ethyl group (\u2014CH2CH3) adds to the chain and can be considered to increment the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C per additional \u2014CH2CH3 unit. As hexacosane has 24 more carbon atoms than ethane, it adds a total of 12 units (24 carbons divided by 2 carbons per unit). Therefore, the predicted increase is about 12 units * +20\u00b0C/unit.",
