        "Reason": "The target compound Chlorzoxazone is composed of several functional groups that can influence its melting point. Starting from a basic phenol structure which has a melting point of about 41\u00b0C (phenol itself), we can consider the following effects: - Chlorine substituent: +30 (due to the increased molecular weight and inductive effects) - Lactam functional group (NC(=O)): +100 (due to hydrogen bonding capabilities and resonance stability) - Lactone functional group (O=C-O-): +20 (due to hydrogen bonding potential) Summing these contributions, we get a total predicted increase of 150\u00b0C over the base phenol structure.",
