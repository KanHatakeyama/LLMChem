        "Reason": "Tetramethylpyrazine is a derivative of pyrazine. Pyrazine has two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered aromatic ring which contribute to a higher melting point due to strong nitrogen-nitrogen single bond. The basic pyrazine structure has a reported melting point of 52\u00b0C. Each methyl group adds to the molecular weight and slight dipole moment, increasing the Van der Waals forces slightly. Considering the effect we usually see with methyl groups, we might estimate an increase of about 5-10\u00b0C per methyl group. We have four such groups. However, we must be cautious about a possible overestimation due to the increasing symmetry and potential better packing of the substituted pyrazine, which can allow the molecule to crystallize more efficiently, thus offsetting the expected incremental increase caused by the additional methyl groups. Therefore, the increase might be at the lower end of the estimate.",
