        "Reason": "The target compound has several functional groups that influence its melting point: an amide group, a hydrazone group, a double bond conjugated with the hydrazone, and branched alkyl groups. The amide group generally contributes to a higher melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance stability, which could increase the value by approximately +80. The hydrazone group can also form hydrogen bonds but is less stable than an amide, potentially contributing +40 to the melting point. The conjugation of the double bond with the hydrazone might slightly increase melting point due to increased planarity and conjugation, possibly by +10. The bulky, branched methyl groups on the alkane chain reduce the symmetry of the molecule and increase the van der Waals forces, potentially contributing +20. The combined effect of these functional groups might be estimated as the sum of each individual contribution.",
        "Prediction": "The estimated contributions of the functional groups are as follows: amide group: +80, hydrazone group: +40, conjugated double bond: +10, branched methyl groups: +20. The sum of these contributions is 80 + 40 + 10 + 20 = 150, so the predicted melting point is 150\u00b0C.",
