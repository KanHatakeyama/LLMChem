        "Reason": "The basic unit cyclohexane has a melting point around 6.5 degrees Celsius. Chlorine substituents generally increase the melting point due to their atomic mass and the resultant increase in intermolecular Van der Waals forces. Each chlorine substituent can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20-25 degrees Celsius due to increased polarizability and intermolecular forces. With six chlorine atoms, this would be an increase of approximately 120 to 150 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the specific stereochemistry of the chlorines in the 1R,2R,3R,4R,5S,6S configuration may lead to a more stable and tightly packed solid structure, which could raise the melting point further. By adding the effect of the chlorines to the base cyclohexane melting point, we get an estimated value between 126.5 to 156.5 degrees Celsius.",
