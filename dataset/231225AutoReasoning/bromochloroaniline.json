        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-bromo-4-chloroaniline is aniline, which has a melting point of around -6\u00b0C. Substituting hydrogen with a bromine atom generally increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size, providing more Van der Waals forces; this can contribute approximately +40\u00b0C. The chloro group, being smaller than the bromo group, has less of an effect but still increases the melting point due to its electron-withdrawing nature, which leads to stronger intermolecular forces; this might contribute around +20\u00b0C. Lastly, the interaction between the amine group and the halogens may also result in stronger hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions, adding potentially another +10\u00b0C.",
