        "Reason": "Ethosuximide consists of a succinimide core with a two-carbon alkyl (ethyl) substituent. The basic unit to consider is succinimide which comprises a cyclic imide structure. Cyclic imides tend to have a relatively low melting point due to the ring strain and lack of extensive hydrogen bonding. A basic cyclic imide may have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The ethyl substituent will likely increase this melting point slightly due to an increased van der Waals forces and a higher molecular weight. A two-carbon alkyl group can be predicted to raise the melting point by approximately 5 to 10 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the contribution of the succinimide core is 50 and the additional two-carbon alkyl group adds roughly 7.5 (which is the average of the 5 to 10 range).",
