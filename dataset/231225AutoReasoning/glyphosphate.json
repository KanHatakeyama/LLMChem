        "Reason": "The compound glyphosate has multiple functional groups that influence its melting point. The carboxylic acid (-COOH) typically raises the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds. Estimating this effect to be around +40 to the base structure without it. The phosphonic acid group is similar to the carboxylic acid in terms of hydrogen bonding and can be predicted to contribute similarly, so an additional +40. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the structure can both increase the polarity and the possibility for hydrogen bonding, and it is estimated to add around +20. The base structure without these functional groups could have an estimated melting point around 90, based on aliphatic compounds of similar molecular size. The sum of these effects gives us the predicted melting point.",
        "Prediction": "90 (base structure) + 40 (carboxylic acid) + 40 (phosphonic acid) + 20 (nitrogen) = 190",
