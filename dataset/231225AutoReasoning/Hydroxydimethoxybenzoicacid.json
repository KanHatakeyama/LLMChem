        "Reason": "The 4-Hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid has several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius. First, the hydroxyl group (OH) attached to the benzene ring generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which can be estimated to raise the melting point by about +50 degrees. The methoxy groups (OCH3), being electron-donating and having small steric effects but increasing the molecular weight, can raise the melting point; each might contribute about +5 to +10 degrees. The carboxylic acid (COOH) functional group, which is already accounted for in benzoic acid, also participates in hydrogen bonding, substantially increasing the melting point; however, as it is the base compound no additional increment is necessary for it specifically. Considering these effects cumulatively, the probable increase for two methoxy groups will be a total of +10 to +20 degrees and for the hydroxyl group +50 degrees.",
