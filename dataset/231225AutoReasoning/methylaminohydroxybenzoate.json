        "Reason": "The compound methyl 4-amino-3-hydroxybenzoate consists of a benzene ring as a base structure with a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Functional groups attached to this base structure will alter this melting point. The ester group (methyl ester of carboxylic acid) generally increases the melting point due to the polarity and possible hydrogen bonding if it were a free acid, but since it's esterified, it contributes less to an increased melting point. Estimation: +20\u00b0C. The amino group generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities; it can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with other molecules. Estimation: +40\u00b0C. The hydroxy group also increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and polarity. Estimation: +30\u00b0C. However, due to intra-molecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxy and the amino group, the overall increase in melting point might be less than the sum of individual effects. Estimation: -10\u00b0C adjustment. The combined estimated effects result in a predicted melting point adjustment of +80\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The base structure of methyl 4-amino-3-hydroxybenzoate is a benzene ring with a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Attached to this are several functional groups that influence its melting point. The methyl ester functional group generally raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and some potential for dipole-dipole interactions, estimate: +30\u00b0C. The amino group contributes significantly to melting point elevation due to its capacity for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, estimate: +50\u00b0C. The hydroxy group also promotes hydrogen bonding, further increasing melting point, estimate: +40\u00b0C. However, the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxy and amino groups reduces the overall increase by limiting the extent of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, estimate: -15\u00b0C adjustment. Summing these contributions gives a total estimated melting point increase of +105\u00b0C from the base benzene structure.",
