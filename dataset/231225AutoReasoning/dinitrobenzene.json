        "Reason": "The basic unit for 1,3-dinitrobenzene is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Addition of nitro groups generally increases the melting point due to the introduction of strong intermolecular forces (like dipoles and the possibility of hydrogen bonding) and increased molecular symmetry which leads to better packing in the solid state. Each nitro group is expected to significantly increase the melting point. Estimating the increase per nitro group as +42\u00b0C (based on the difference in melting points between benzene and nitrobenzene, which is a rough approximation), we would have an increase of 84\u00b0C (2 nitro groups) on the basic benzene unit.",
