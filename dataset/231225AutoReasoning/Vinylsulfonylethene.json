        "Reason": "The target compound, (vinylsulfonyl)ethene, has several functional groups to consider: the vinyl group (C=C), the sulfone group (S(=O)2), and the conjugation between these functionalities. The basic unit we can consider is ethene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The presence of the vinyl group typically raises the melting point due to increased rigidity and planarity; this effect could be estimated at around +30\u00b0C. Sulfone groups significantly raise melting points due to their polarity and ability for strong dipole-dipole interactions; this might be an additional +100\u00b0C. The conjugation of the vinyl group with the sulfone group may further stabilize the solid structure, increasing the melting point by an estimated +20\u00b0C. However, the presence of the double bonds still allows for some flexibility in the molecule which could counteract some melting point elevation.",
        "Prediction": "-19.2\u00b0C (as a result of adding the estimated effects to the basic ethene value: -169.2 + 30 + 100 + 20)",
