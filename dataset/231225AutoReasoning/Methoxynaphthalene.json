        "Reason": "Basic unit, naphthalene, has a melting point of 80.5\u00b0C. A methoxy group generally reduces the melting point due to it introducing electron-donating effects and disrupting the symmetry and crystalline stability of the molecule, which can be estimated as a -10\u00b0C change. The conjugation effect of the methoxy connected to an aromatic system can be minor but might slightly lower the melting point additionally, estimated as a -2\u00b0C change. Therefore, the total estimated decrease in melting point due to the methoxy group on naphthalene is -12\u00b0C.",
