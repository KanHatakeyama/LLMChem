        "Reason": "The target compound, 4-iodobiphenyl, consists of two benzene rings connected by a single covalent bond and one iodine atom attached to one of the benzene rings. A basic benzene ring has a melting point of approximately 5.5 \u00b0C. Biphenyl, which is two benzene rings connected together, has a higher melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C compared to benzene, giving biphenyl a melting point around 75.5 \u00b0C. The iodine substituent is a large, heavy atom that provides additional van der Waals interactions as well as inducing some dipole moments due to its electronegativity, which results in a further increase in the melting point. Given its significant size and mass, the introduction of iodine to biphenyl will raise the melting point by roughly +37.5\u00b0C.",
