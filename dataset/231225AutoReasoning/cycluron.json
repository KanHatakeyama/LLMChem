        "Reason": "Cycluron is a compound made up of different functional groups, including a cycloalkane, amide, and tertiary amine. Starting with the simplest cycloalkane, cyclooctane, which has a melting point around -21\u00b0C, we can predict the effect of each functional group. The amide group generally increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, typically contributing around +80\u00b0C to +100\u00b0C to the melting point. The tertiary amine (N(CH3)2) can also increase the melting point, but to a lesser extent than the amide due to its inability to form hydrogen bonds; we can estimate an increase of about +15\u00b0C. Together, these increases yield a predicted melting point higher than the base cycloalkane. However, since cycluron also has potential for internal hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point further, we adjust our prediction accordingly.",
