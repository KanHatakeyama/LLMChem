        "Reason": "Starting with the base functional group, ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -83.6 degrees Celsius. Since isopentyl acetate is similar but has an isopentyl group instead of an ethyl group, we consider the effects of the larger isopentyl. The isopentyl group is larger and adds more molecular weight compared to an ethyl group, so it will likely raise the melting point. The estimated increase due to the isopentyl group is around +5 degrees Celsius because of the additional carbon atoms and the increased Van der Waals forces.",
