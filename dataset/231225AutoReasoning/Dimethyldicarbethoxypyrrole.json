        "Reason": "The base structure, pyrrole, has a melting point around 23 degrees Celsius. Substitutions on the pyrrole ring can either raise or lower this temperature depending on their nature and position. Carbethoxy groups (-CO2Ethyl) are electron-withdrawing due to the presence of oxygen atoms and can be expected to increase the melting point through stronger intermolecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each carbethoxy group might contribute around +40 to +50 degrees Celsius. Methyl groups (-CH3) are electron-donating and can provide additional van der Waals forces, slightly increasing the melting point, but they also increase steric hindrance, which could disrupt packing. Each methyl group might contribute around +5 to +10 degrees Celsius. The combined effects of two carbethoxy groups (+80 to +100) and two methyl groups (+10 to +20) would yield an estimated increase of +90 to +120 degrees Celsius on top of the base pyrrole melting point.",
