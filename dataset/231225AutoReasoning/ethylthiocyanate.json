        "Reason": "The basic unit of ethyl thiocyanate can be considered as thiocyanate (-SCN), which has a relatively higher melting point due to its polar nature and ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions. However, the ethyl group (-CH2-CH3) is non-polar and tends to lower the melting point because it adds alkyl bulk without adding significant polar interactions. Thiocyanate's melting point is shifted downwards by the presence of the ethyl group. Starting from a rough estimation for a generic thiocyanate ionic compound (which can have a very high melting point, often above 300\u00b0C), we must significantly adjust this value downward for the non-ionic, smaller organic molecule ethyl thiocyanate: \n- Thiocyanate base unit: assumes high starting point, but no specific numeric value given for adjustment. \n- Ethyl group: due to alkyl bulk and non-polar nature, roughly -400\u00b0C to lower the melting point significantly to bring it in the range of similar small organic molecules with both polar and non-polar characteristics.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit of ethyl thiocyanate is the thiocyanate anion (-SCN), which in its ionic form can have a high melting point due to ion-ion interactions. However, ethyl thiocyanate is a covalent compound, and this difference significantly reduces the melting point. The presence of the ethyl group (-CH2-CH3), which is non-polar, introduces some alkyl bulk and reduces polarity, thereby lowering the melting point. Additionally, the C-N triple bond and the S-C bond in the SCN group are strong and rigid but do not particularly elevate the melting point due to the overall non-polarity and size of the molecule. Therefore, the prediction must account for a significant decrease from a hypothetical high melting point of an ionic thiocyanate. A reasonable estimate for the decrease due to the ethyl group in organic molecules could be in the range of -300\u00b0C to -400\u00b0C. Adding the polar but small SCN moiety could adjust this figure slightly upwards. Let's quantify the impacts as follows: Thiocyanate-like group base unit: assume -50\u00b0C for its polar but small contribution, Ethyl group: roughly -375\u00b0C for the decrease due to non-polar alkyl bulk.",
