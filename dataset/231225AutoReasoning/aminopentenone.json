        "Reason": "Starting from the basic unit, propanone (acetone), which has a melting point around -95 degrees Celsius. We must consider the effects of adding various functional groups to the acetone structure. First, the addition of an amino group (NH2) on the aromatic ring generally increases the melting point due to the introduction of hydrogen bonding which provides additional intermolecular forces, this might increase by approximately +40 degrees Celsius. Next, extending the carbon chain length by two carbons increases the molecular weight and surface area allowing for greater van der Waals interactions, which usually increases the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius for each additional carbon. However, incorporating a carbon-carbon double bond (alkene) tends to lower the melting point as it introduces geometric constraints that can disrupt crystal packing, decreasing it by roughly -30 degrees Celsius. Lastly, moving a carbonyl group from the terminal position (as in acetone) to the penultimate position (keto group) can alter the melting point due to changes in polarity and possible internal hydrogen bonding; this factor is rather complex but might roughly be estimated at about +10 degrees Celsius. Combining these factors: -95 (acetone) + 40 (amino) + 40 (2 extra carbons) - 30 (double bond) + 10 (keto placement) results in an estimated melting point.",

We must consider the effects of adding various functional groups to the acetone structure. Firstly, the addition of an amino group (NH2) typically increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which provides additional intermolecular force, estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +80 degrees Celsius. Extending the carbon chain length by two carbons can increase the molecular weight and surface area, allowing for greater London dispersion forces, which might increase the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius per additional carbon. However, the introduction of a carbon-carbon double bond (alkene) tends to decrease the melting point by introducing steric hindrance and reducing crystal packing efficiency, estimated to be a -5 degrees Celsius effect. Lastly, moving a carbonyl group to the penultimate position (keto group) from the terminal generally increases melting point due to enhanced polarity and possible intramolecular hydrogen bonding; we might estimate this effect to be around +5 degrees Celsius. Summing these effects: -95 (acetone) + 80 (amino group) + 20 (two extra carbons) - 5 (double bond) + 5 (keto placement) should give a rough estimate.",

        "Reason": "The compound 4-amino-3-penten-2-one contains several functional groups that need to be considered: the ketone (carbonyl), the alkene, and the primary amine. The basic unit for comparison here is pentane, which has a melting point of -130. The introduction of a double bond in an alkene typically decreases the melting point due to less efficient packing, which can be approximated as -20. However, the carbonyl (ketone) group adds rigidity to the molecule and allows for better intermolecular hydrogen bonding, potentially increasing the melting point by +50. A primary amine can also engage in hydrogen bonding, which could further increase the melting point, estimated at +40. Balancing these effects, the ketone and amine increases should outweigh the alkene's decrease.",

        "Reason": "The target compound, 4-amino-3-penten-2-one, can be thought of as a derivative of pentanone. The basic pentanone structure would have a certain melting point. In this molecule: (1) The presence of an amino group (\u2013NH2) is likely to introduce hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point. However, the specific location at the terminal end might reduce this effect slightly compared to being centrally-located. The amino group might add around +40 to the melting point. (2) The alkene group (C=C) typically has a slight lowering effect on the melting point due to less efficient packing, perhaps by around -5. (3) The ketone (C=O) can establish dipole-dipole interactions increasing the melting point, estimated at +20. The net effect of these functional groups gives us our predicted melting point adjustment. Basic pentanone as pentane has a melting point around -130, as a starting reference for ketones.",
