        "Reason": "The target compound, 2,2-dimethylpropane, is a branched alkane. The basic unit for comparison is ethane, which has a melting point of \u2212183 \u00b0C. Branched alkanes generally have higher melting points compared to their straight-chain isomers due to better packing in the solid state; however, the effect is less pronounced in smaller alkanes. Each additional methyl group on a central carbon atom increases the compactness and the van der Waals forces, thus increasing the melting point. The introduction of one methyl group to ethane to form propane raises the melting point by approximately 87 degrees (ethane's melting point of \u2212183 \u00b0C to propane's melting point of \u221296.7 \u00b0C). Methylation at secondary carbons in butane and higher alkanes has been observed to increase the melting point by about 20-30 degrees for each methyl group. However, in this case, we are adding three methyl groups to a central carbon, and so the incremental addition effect might be lower. An estimate of 20 degrees per added methyl group on the central carbon might be reasonable for 2,2-dimethylpropane.",

Branched alkanes generally have higher melting points compared to their straight-chain isomers due to better packing in the solid state. In this case, the branching occurs due to two additional methyl groups attached to the central carbon atom compared to propane. Each methyl group can be estimated to raise the melting point, yet the exact effect is smaller for compact molecules like 2,2-dimethylpropane. A conservative estimation for the increase in melting point per methyl group might be around 10 degrees for such a small molecule. Considering that the \u2212187.7 \u00b0C is for propane and we have two additional methyl groups (taking into account only the difference from propane to 2,2-dimethylpropane), we add 20 degrees for these two methyl groups.",

Each of the two additional methyl groups, due to steric hindrance and increased molecular weight, tends to increase the melting point. Adding one methyl group to form isobutane raises the melting point because of increased molecular size and hindered rotation, which we can approximate as a +20\u00b0C adjustment per methyl group on a primary carbon. However, in the case of 2,2-dimethylpropane, the two additional methyl groups are on the same (tertiary) carbon, which might lead to a lesser increment due to steric hindrance between the methyl groups. Therefore, we adjust our estimate to a +10\u00b0C increment for each of the additional methyl groups on that carbon.",
