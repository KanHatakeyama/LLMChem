        "Reason": "The benzene ring is the base structure, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. A p-substituted toluene generally has a higher melting point than benzene itself due to added steric hindrance and molecular weight, which contribute to its increase. A methyl group (toluene) adds approximately +20\u00b0C. The addition of a bromine atom, which is quite large and heavy, will further increase the melting point due to increased intermolecular London dispersion forces. The effect of a bromine atom generally contributes +30\u00b0C to the melting point.",
