        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of hexanoic anhydride, we must consider the functional groups within the molecule. The parent structure is hexanoic acid, which typically has a melting point of around 12 to 14 degrees Celsius due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds. However, in forming an anhydride, these hydrogen bonds are no longer possible, which generally lowers the melting point. Anhydrides also have two acyl groups connected by an oxygen atom, which increases the molecular weight and size of the compound, but in this case, this increase in molecular size is not enough to lead to a higher melting point due to the loss of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The lack of hydrogen bonding and the relatively light molecular weight of hexanoic anhydride compared to larger anhydrides result in a melting point that is lower than that of the corresponding acid.",
