        "Reason": "The compound 7-morpholinomethyltheophylline consists of a theophylline base structure with the addition of a morpholino methyl group. Theophylline itself has a melting point of about 271 degrees Celsius. The morpholino group, which is a non-aromatic ether, typically lowers the melting point due to its flexibility and the introduction of a possible point of structural weakness. However, the methyl group attached to the morpholino group can slightly raise the melting point because of the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Taking these into account: Theophylline base melting point decrease from the morpholino group (about -100 degrees Celsius) and a slight increase from the methyl group attached to morpholino (about +6 degrees Celsius).",
