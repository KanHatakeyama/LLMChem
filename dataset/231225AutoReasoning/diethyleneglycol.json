        "Reason": "Diethylene glycol is an organic compound with two ether linkages (-O-) and two hydroxyl groups (-OH). The basic backbone without any functional groups, ethane, has a melting point of -182. The following functional group adjustments have been made to predict the melting point of diethylene glycol: \n- Ether linkage (-O-): Each ether linkage is polar and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, though they don\u2019t have the capability to form hydrogen bonds, which typically raises the melting point relative to nonpolar compounds. Because there are two ether linkages, we can estimate an increase from the base by +20 for each, totaling +40. \n- Hydroxyl group (-OH): The hydroxyl group contributes to extensive hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point relative to the base hydrocarbon due to strong intermolecular forces. Since diethylene glycol has two hydroxyl groups, we can estimate an increase of +70 per group, totaling +140. \nCombining these increases gives us a predicted melting point that we can compare to the actual value.
