        "Reason": "The compound cyclandelate consists of several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic unit of consideration is the biphenyl group, which has a melting point around 70\u00b0C. The ester group (-COOC-) typically contributes to a decrease in the melting point due to its ability to participate in internal rotations, which makes the molecule less rigid and more easily disruptable by heat. This could be an approximate decrease of about -20\u00b0C. Cyclohexane on its own has a low melting point (-7\u00b0C), and while the presence of the cyclohexyl group adds steric bulk which could increase the melting point, it also disrupts crystal packing which generally lowers the melting point; This effect could approximately be a -10\u00b0C change. Additionally, the two methyl groups on the cyclohexyl ring add some bulk as well, possibly contributing an increase of about +4\u00b0C each (+8\u00b0C total). Therefore, the predicted melting point balances out the effects of these groups.",
