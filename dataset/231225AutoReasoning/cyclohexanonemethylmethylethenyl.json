        "Reason": "The parental compound, cyclohexanone, has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. The substitutions to consider are: a methyl group (isopropyl group, more accurately) on the cyclohexanone ring and a vinyl group (due to the '1-methylethenyl' group). A methyl group typically reduces the melting point due to its weak van der Waals interactions when compared to the stronger dipole-dipole interactions in the unbranched chain, thus it can be estimated as -20\u00b0C for the two methyl groups together. The vinyl group introduces some degree of planarity and rigidity but also contributes to branching, which generally lowers the melting point as well, estimated as -5\u00b0C. Taking these into account, the overall prediction for the melting point would account for both these substituent effects.",
