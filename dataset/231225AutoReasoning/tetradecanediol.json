        "Reason": "The compound 1,14-tetradecanediol consists of a linear alkane chain with 14 carbon atoms and two hydroxyl (OH) groups, one at each end. The long-chain alkane has a significant influence on the melting point due to the increased van der Waals interactions. For instance, n-tetradecane, an alkane with 14 carbon atoms, has a melting point of 5.9 \u00b0C. Hydroxyl groups typically raise the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds. Estimating the effect of each hydroxyl group to be approximately +40 \u00b0C (as seen in comparisons between alcohols and their corresponding alkanes), the predicted melting point for 1,14-tetradecanediol would be the melting point of n-tetradecane plus the contributions of two hydroxyl groups.",
        "Prediction": "5.9 (base alkane) + 40 (OH group influence) * 2 = 85.9 \u00b0C",
