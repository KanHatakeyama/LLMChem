        "Reason": "N-phenylmaleimide contains several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic structure we're starting from is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Each functional group will modify this base value. The N-phenyl group adds substantial aromatic character and some steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point significantly. We can estimate this effect to be +45\u00b0C. The imide groups introduce rigidity and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, which are likely to substantially increase the melting point. For the two imide groups, the estimated effect would be around +30\u00b0C each, given their strong influence on structuring the solid state due to potential for hydrogen bonding and planar structure imposing high crystal packing efficiency. So the combined effect of these functional groups on the melting point will be quite significant.",

        "Reason": "N-phenylmaleimide features a benzene ring as the core structure and two functional groups: an N-phenyl group and an imide group. Starting with benzene which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we then consider the effect of the N-phenyl group. The N-phenyl group contributes to an increase in melting point due to added aromaticity and steric hindrance, we can estimate this increase to be around +25\u00b0C. The imide group is rigid and can engage in hydrogen bonding, leading to a higher degree of crystal packing. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms capable of hydrogen bonding, we estimate that each imide group could contribute an increase of about +28\u00b0C to the melting point. Altogether, these functional group contributions can be quantitatively approximated as follows: Benzene base value (5.5\u00b0C) + N-phenyl increase (+25\u00b0C) + Imide group increase (2 groups at +28\u00b0C each).",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for N-phenylmaleimide is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Adding a maleimide group, which has a high degree of conjugation and can participate in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding due to its imide hydrogen, significantly increases the melting point. A basic maleimide has a melting point around 93-94\u00b0C. The N-phenyl group adds further aromaticity and has a larger molecular weight than a hydrogen atom, leading to an increase in van der Waals interactions and stability of the crystal lattice, but it also reduces symmetry slightly compared to the symmetrical maleimide, potentially decreasing the melting point. The combined effect of these groups could be an increase of roughly 80\u00b0C from the basic benzene unit due to the maleimide and an additional increase of about 3-5\u00b0C for the phenyl addition, but also considering a minor symmetrical reduction of about -5\u00b0C.",
