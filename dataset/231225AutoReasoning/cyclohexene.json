        "Reason": "Starting with the base structure of cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius, we consider how the introduction of a double bond to form cyclohexene will affect this value. The double bond in cyclohexene induces a degree of planarity and rigidity in the structure, leading to less efficient packing which typically reduces the melting point. Moreover, the double bond reduces the number of hydrogen atoms, slightly decreasing the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which also contributes to lowering the melting point. The presence of the double bond is expected to lower the melting point by approximately 110.5 degrees Celsius from the melting point of cyclohexane.",
