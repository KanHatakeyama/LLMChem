        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group typically raises the melting point slightly due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, we can estimate this as +12\u00b0C. Hydroxyl groups (OH) on the aromatic ring have two opposing effects: they increase polarity, which tends to raise the melting point due to stronger hydrogen bonding, and they also introduce steric hindrance that can disrupt crystal packing, which might lower the melting point. Since there are two hydroxyl groups, their effects on the melting point of the compound should be considered additive. Hydroxyl groups on an aromatic ring could be estimated to raise the melting point by about +45\u00b0C per OH group due to strong hydrogen bonding. However, due to steric hindrance and the potential disruptions in crystal packing, the effect might be slightly lower, so we can conservatively estimate +40\u00b0C per hydroxyl group.",
        "Prediction": "The melting point of 3,5-dihydroxytoluene would be approximately 5.5 (basic benzene) + 12 (methyl group) + 40 (first hydroxyl group) + 40 (second hydroxyl group) = 97.5\u00b0C.",
        "Prediction(integer)": 97.0
