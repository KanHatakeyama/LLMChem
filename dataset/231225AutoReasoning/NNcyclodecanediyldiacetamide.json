        "Reason": "The parent structure of the target compound is cylcodecane, which has a melting point of around 6\u00b0C. The addition of two acetyl (C=O) groups to form amides increases polarity and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, significantly elevating the melting point. The acetyl groups can be expected to increase the melting point by approximately 70-80\u00b0C each due to their polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The effect of the amide linkages (N-C=O) further increases the melting point because of the strong hydrogen bonds that can form, as well as resonance stabilization of the amide bond. This could add another 80-90\u00b0C for each amide bond.",
