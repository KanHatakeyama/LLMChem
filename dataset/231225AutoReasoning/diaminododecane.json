        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 1,12-diaminododecane, it is necessary to consider the individual effects of the alkane chain and the amine groups. As a starting point, the melting point for a similar length alkane, dodecane, is around -9.6\u00b0C. The presence of the amino groups contributes positively to the melting point due to the increased possibility of hydrogen bonding. Each primary amine group could increase the melting point considerably. Let us estimate this increase to be approximately 40\u00b0C per amine group given the strong hydrogen-bonding potential of primary amines. That gives an estimated total increase of 80\u00b0C due to the two amine groups. Therefore, starting from a base of -9.6\u00b0C for dodecane and adding approximately 80\u00b0C for the amine effects, we arrive at a predicted melting point for 1,12-diaminododecane.",
