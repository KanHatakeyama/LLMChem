        "Reason": "The compound (2-carboxyphenyl)iminodiacetic acid has several functional groups that significantly impact its melting point. Firstly, the benzene ring serves as the base structure. Let's consider benzoic acid as the closest simple analogue with a known melting point, which is 122\u00b0C for benzoic acid. We then consider the following functional groups and their effects: \n- Carboxyl group attached to the benzene adds significantly to the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and increased polarity; each additional carboxyl group can raise the melting point approximately by 40\u00b0C. \n- The iminodiacetic acid side chain adds complexity to the structure and possibly additional hydrogen bonding, but its effect is less pronounced compared to carboxyl groups. We can roughly estimate an increase of 10\u00b0C for this side chain. \n- The nitrogen atom may additionally participate in hydrogen bonding; however, its effect is already considered with the imino and carboxyl groups. \nCombining all these effects, the estimated increase from the base structure of benzoic acid (122\u00b0C) would be around 95\u00b0C (40\u00b0C for each of two extra carboxyl groups and 15\u00b0C for the iminodiacetic acid side chain).",
