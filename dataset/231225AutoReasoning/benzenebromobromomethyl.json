        "Reason": "The compound in question is 1-bromo-4-(bromomethyl) benzene. The basic unit here is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of bromine atoms on the benzene ring generally increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the polarizability of the molecule, which enhances van der Waals interactions. The addition of each bromine is expected to increase the melting point: Bromine on ring: +20 degrees Celsius (two occurrences). The additional bromomethyl group is also expected to increase the melting point through an aliphatic carbon elongation effect. Bromomethyl group: +10 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the overall estimate for the melting point increase due to functional groups would be: Benzene basal point (5.5) + Bromine on ring (2 * 20) + Bromomethyl group (10).",
