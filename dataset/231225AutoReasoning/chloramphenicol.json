        "Reason": "Chloramphenicol consists of a dichloroacetyl group, a nitro group, two hydroxyl groups, an amide linkage, and a primary alcohol attached to a benzene ring. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The dichloroacetyl group is large and bulky which increases the molecular complexity and weight contributing to a higher melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and introduces significant intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by roughly +45\u00b0C. Each of the two hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, adding about +40\u00b0C for both. The amide linkage contributes to hydrogen bonding and rigidity, adding approximately +35\u00b0C. The primary alcohol also engages in hydrogen bonding, adding around +20\u00b0C. However, these are cumulative estimates and the presence of multiple polar groups in close proximity will lead to stronger intermolecular forces than the sum of their individual contributions. This collective increase is anticipated to be somewhat mitigated.",
