        "Reason": "The base unit for this compound is urea, which has a melting point of 133 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the 2-thioureido group increases melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding potential (+20). The o-methoxyphenyl substituent adds aromaticity and some additional resonance stability, which may raise the melting point slightly. However, the methoxy group in the ortho position will introduce some steric hindrance which can reduce the effective intermolecular hydrogen bonding, slightly lowering the melting point (-5). The overall expected increase from the substituents is approximately +15 degrees Celsius.",
