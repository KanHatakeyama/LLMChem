        "Reason": "Nialamide is a compound that includes several functional groups such as the amide groups, amines, aromatic rings, and an alkyl chain that influence its melting point. The base structure here can be thought of as two benzenoid rings. Each benzene ring tends to have a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The amide groups typically increase the melting point of compounds due to the potential for hydrogen bonding; an amide group can add around 80 \u00b0C to a molecule's melting point. The presence of the secondary amine (\u2013NHN\u2013) can also raise the melting point slightly due to hydrogen bonding, let's estimate this at about 10 \u00b0C. However, the alkyl chain (-CCC-) in between amide groups introduces some flexibility to the molecule, which could decrease the melting point this is estimated to be around -5 \u00b0C. Considering there are two amide groups, two aromatic rings, and one amine, the overall adjustment would be: (2 * 5.5) + (2 * 80) + 10 - 5.",
