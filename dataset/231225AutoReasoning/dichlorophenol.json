        "Reason": "The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of approximately 41\u00b0C. Each chloro substitution adds some rigidity to the molecule and increases its ability to participate in intermolecular interactions due to electronegativity of the chlorine atom. This would generally increase the melting point. However, chloro groups also add steric hindrance which can disrupt the crystalline lattice, potentially causing a decrease in melting point. In dichlorophenol, these effects compete, but the overall trend for chlorination tends to be an increase in melting point due to enhanced polar interactions. In this case, one can estimate chloro group to add +1\u00b0C per chlorine atom to the melting point.",
