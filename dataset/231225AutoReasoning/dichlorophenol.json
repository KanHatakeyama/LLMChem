        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Chlorine substituents generally increase the melting point due to their high electronegativity and the introduction of dipole-dipole interactions, as well as increasing the molecular weight. Each chlorine can be approximated to increase the melting point by +40 \u00b0C. The presence of the hydroxyl (OH) group introduces hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point. The OH group can be approximated to contribute +100 \u00b0C to the melting point. Therefore, the cumulative effect of two chlorines and one OH group (+40 + 40 + 100) should be added to the basic benzene unit. However, steric factors and the overall molecular symmetry need to be considered, which might adjust the impact slightly.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the melting point because of higher molecular weight and strong intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine atom can be estimated to add approximately +20 \u00b0C to the melting point. The hydroxyl (OH) group significantly increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. This effect of the OH group can be approximated to add +50 \u00b0C to the melting point. Thus, the combined effect of two chlorines (+20 + 20) and one OH group (+50) will be added to the benzene base value.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of 41\u00b0C. Each chloro substituent will increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and the possible enhancement of intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Chloro groups are electron-withdrawing and can engage in stronger hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group, raising the melting point further. The presence of two chloro groups will have an additive effect. Estimating the contribution of each chloro group to be about +10\u00b0C to +15\u00b0C, the total increase from the base melting point would then be approximately +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C.",
