Considering the quantitative influence on the melting point: Basic benzene's melting point is 5.5\u00b0C. Adding an amide functional group notably increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity; this can contribute to an increase of approximately +110\u00b0C. The methyl group, however, generally has a smaller effect compared to amide groups but can slightly increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions; this might contribute an increase of around +5\u00b0C.",

The starting point for the prediction is the melting point of benzene, which is 5.5\u00b0C. An amide functional group is associated with a substantial increase in the melting point due to its capacity for strong hydrogen bonding and polarity; this could lead to an increase of approximately +70\u00b0C. The methyl group attached to the benzene ring will raise the melting point further due to an increase in hydrophobic surface area and van der Waals interactions, although its effect is comparatively mild, estimated at about +5\u00b0C.",

Starting with formamide, the base unit, which has a melting point of 2-3\u00b0C. Adding a phenyl group tends to increase the melting point due to the added aromaticity and potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, this increment can be roughly +100\u00b0C. The addition of a methyl group to the phenyl ring (making it 2-methylphenyl) can increase the melting point marginally due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated as +5\u00b0C. However, due to the ortho position of the methyl group, there might be some steric hindrance which can reduce the overall symmetry and packing efficiency in the solid state, potentially slightly lowering the melting point, we will consider a negative contribution of -5\u00b0C for this effect.",

        "Reason": "The compound n-(2-methylphenyl)formamide comprises formamide as the basic unit, which has a melting point range of 2-3\u00b0C. The introduction of a phenyl ring typically increases melting point significantly because the presence of the benzene ring allows for \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions which enhance the crystal lattice's stability, contributing to an increase of about +100\u00b0C. However, the presence of a methyl group attached to the aromatic ring increases the melting point due to the higher molecular weight and the increased van der Waals forces; this could contribute with approximately +5\u00b0C. Nevertheless, the ortho-substitution of the methyl group may introduce some steric hindrance, disrupting the optimal packing of the molecules within the crystal lattice, which can have a negative impact on the melting point. This effect can be estimated as -15\u00b0C since the disruption of the planarity and symmetry of aromatic packings in the crystal is a significant factor. Therefore, the prediction needs to be adjusted downwards to account for this ortho-methyl effect.",

Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we add the effects of the substituents. The formamide group is polar and can engage in hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point; we estimate this effect to be +100\u00b0C. The methyl group has a smaller effect but still raises the melting point by adding extra molecular weight and slight steric bulk, estimated at +5\u00b0C. Combining these effects, we get an overall predicted melting point.",

The 2-methyl group also has an effect on the melting point; however, it is much less significant than that of the formamide group. An estimate for the methyl group's contribution might be around +5\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and slight steric hindrance.
