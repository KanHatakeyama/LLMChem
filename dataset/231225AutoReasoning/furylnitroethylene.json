        "Reason": "The compound 1-(2-furyl)-2-nitroethylene consists of several distinct functional groups that influence its melting point. Starting with furan, a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with an oxygen, has a melting point around -85.6. The vinyl group (C=C) typically decreases the melting point due to its less polar nature and prevention of tight packing, estimated to have an effect of -10. The nitro group (NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group and can increase the melting point due to increased intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonding, estimated to have an effect of +80. Therefore, combining these contributions, we can predict the melting point of the target compound.",
