        "Reason": "The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of approximately 41\u00b0C. The methoxy group (-OCH3) typically raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding interactions; this can contribute an estimated +20\u00b0C. The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can substantially raise the melting point due to its capacity to enhance intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, contributing an estimated +50\u00b0C.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point would be the sum of the contributions: 41 (phenol) + 20 (methoxy group) + 50 (nitro group) = 111\u00b0C",
        "Prediction(integer)": 111.0
