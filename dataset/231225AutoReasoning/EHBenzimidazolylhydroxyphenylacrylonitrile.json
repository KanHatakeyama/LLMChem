        "Reason": "The compound in question contains several functional groups that will influence its melting point. The basic structure we can consider as a starting point is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. From there, we need to account for the following functional groups and structural features: \n- Benzimidazole moiety: +150 (this is a rigid and planar heteroaromatic system which provides significant stabilization and raises the melting point substantially). \n- Phenyl group: +30 (this brings additional pi-pi interactions and further rigidity to the structure). \n- Acrylonitrile moiety: +100 (the carbon-carbon triple bond and the nitrile group contribute to the rigidity and polar character of the molecule). \n- Hydroxyl group: +10 (hydrogen bonding can increase the melting point, but since there's only one such group its effect is moderate). \nAdding all these together gives an estimated change of +290 degrees Celsius to the base structure of benzene.",
