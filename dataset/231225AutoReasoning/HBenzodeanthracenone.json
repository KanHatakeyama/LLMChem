        "Reason": "The basic unit for this molecule can be considered as anthracene, which has a melting point of approximately 216 degrees Celsius. The ketone functional group (C=O) is withdrawing through resonance, slightly increasing the rigidity and symmetry of the molecule, which can raise the melting point. However, ketones also disrupt crystalline packing to some extent, which can lead to a decrease in the melting point. The net effect of a ketone on anthracene likely lowers the melting point due to this disruption. Considering the effects of the ketone, a decrease of roughly 46 degrees is estimated.",
