        "Reason": "The basic structure of camphor consists of a bicyclic ring ketone. Bicyclic compounds typically have a higher melting point due to the rigid structure, which increases intermolecular interactions. Let's start with cyclohexanone as a reference point, which has a melting point around 44 degrees Celsius. The addition of the bicyclic system in camphor provides a much more rigid structure, which could increase the melting point significantly. We can estimate this effect to be around +80 degrees Celsius. Camphor also has several methyl groups attached to the rings. Methyl groups generally raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals forces, but they also can introduce steric hindrance, which may lower the symmetry and decrease the melting point slightly. We can estimate this effect to be around +5 degrees Celsius per each methyl group, with three such groups present. The bicyclic system and the ketone group have a large impact on rigidity and symmetry as well contributing to the high melting point.",

        "Reason": "Starting with cyclohexanone as a reference, with a melting point of 44\u00b0C, we estimate the effect of the bicyclic structure. Due to increased rigidity and intermolecular interactions, the bicyclic nature of camphor is likely to contribute significantly to its melting point. We can roughly attribute an additional +100\u00b0C for this structural feature based on typical trends observed in bicyclic compounds compared to their monocyclic counterparts. Each methyl group attached to the ring increases the molecular weight and enhances van der Waals forces, which typically would raise melting points. However, they also introduce steric hindrance, which could reduce packing efficiency. A conservative estimate for each methyl group\u2019s contribution could be around +10\u00b0C. Given that camphor has three such groups, their combined estimated effect would be +30\u00b0C. Additionally, the carbonyl group contributes to the intermolecular interactions through possible dipole-dipole forces, which typically increase the melting point. We can estimate the carbonyl group's contribution to be around +10\u00b0C. Combining these estimates gives us the predicted melting point for camphor.",
