        "Reason": "We start with the basic unit, benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. An amino group (-NH2) when attached to benzene tends to increase the melting point significantly because of the capability to form hydrogen bonds; this can increase the melting point by approximately 80\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group (-OH) has a similar effect, also capable of hydrogen bonding, which might increase the melting point by around 70\u00b0C. However, when they are positioned meta to each other, as in m-aminophenol, the inductive and resonance effects may slightly moderate these increases, since the group's ability to interact with each other and with other molecules is reduced compared to the para or ortho positions. We might reduce the increments slightly by 15\u00b0C for the diminished synergy between the groups in the meta position.",

        "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of an amino group (-NH2) can substantially increase the melting point due to its capacity for hydrogen bonding; an increase of approximately 40\u00b0C can be assigned to the -NH2 group. Similarly, a hydroxyl (-OH) group also significantly contributes to raising the melting point because of hydrogen bonding and is typically associated with an increase of approximately 40\u00b0C. Since the amino and hydroxyl groups are in the meta position, their ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds is not as effectively synergistic as it would be if they were in ortho or para positions. However, both groups still contribute individually to the melting point elevation. It is reasonable to separately count their contributions without a synergistic reduction because the reduced opportunity for intergroup hydrogen bonding is balanced by intragroup and intermolecular bonding with other such molecules in the lattice.",
