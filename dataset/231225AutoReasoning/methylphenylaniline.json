        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is aniline, which has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group is expected to increase the melting point significantly due to increased pi-pi stacking interactions and higher molecular weight, which could contribute around +70 degrees Celsius. The methyl group, being an electron-donating group, further stabilizes the aromatic ring system through hyperconjugation and slightly increases the melting point, potentially adding around +5 degrees Celsius. Combining these effects: -6 (basic aniline) + 70 (phenyl group) + 5 (methyl group) gives the predicted melting point.",

        "Reason": "The initial reference point is aniline which has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. Adding a phenyl group at the para position of aniline increases steric hindrance and molecular rigidity and therefore is expected to increase the melting point. However, the increase should not be as high as +70 degrees Celsius given that such large increases are not typically observed with the addition of a single phenyl group. A more realistic increment might be around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. The 2-methyl group introduces additional steric hindrance and slight increases in molecular weight but has a smaller impact compared to the phenyl group. The methyl group's contribution is likely to be in the range of +5 to +10 degrees Celsius. Adding these modifications to the base value of aniline leads to the predicted melting point.",
