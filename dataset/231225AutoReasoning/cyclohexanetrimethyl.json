        "Reason": "The base compound cyclohexane has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. Each methyl group generally decreases the melting point due to the introduction of bulk, which can disrupt the crystalline packing and lower the melting point. For a mono-substituted methyl group, the decrease might be around -10\u00b0C. Since there are three methyl groups, one of them being on the same carbon as another (geminal), the combined effect of the first two could be around -20\u00b0C (since the geminal substitution introduces more steric hindrance and thus decreases the melting point further, let's estimate that as -12\u00b0C for the two). The third methyl group is less hindered and could be estimated to have a -8\u00b0C effect.",
