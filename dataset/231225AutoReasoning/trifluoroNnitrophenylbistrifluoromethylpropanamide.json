        "Reason": "The base molecule is propanamide with a typical melting point around 80-85 degrees Celsius. The addition of fluorine atoms generally increases the melting point due to the high electronegativity and the strong dipole-dipole interactions these atoms induce. Each CF3 group (with three fluorine atoms) might raise the melting point significantly, estimated approximately +50 degrees Celsius per group. There are two of these groups, therefore a total increase of +100 degrees. The nitro group (NO2) on the benzene ring contributes to an increase in melting point due to intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and possible \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between aromatic rings, estimated around +30 degrees. Trifluoromethyl groups directly attached to the amide nitrogen could have a lesser-stabilizing effect due to steric hindrance affecting the overall hydrogen bonding capability, but they provide an inductive effect which could result in an increase of about +20 for the CF3 and the directly attached CF3 group, providing a total of +40 (considering them separately would give an overestimation). Lastly, the presence of the benzene ring itself typically adds around +25 degrees to the melting point compared to aliphatic amides.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point is 80 (for the base propanamide) + 100 (for the two CF3 groups) + 30 (for the nitro group on the benzene) + 40 (for the CF3 group's influence on the amide and the direct attachment) + 25 (for the benzene ring) = 275 degrees Celsius.",
