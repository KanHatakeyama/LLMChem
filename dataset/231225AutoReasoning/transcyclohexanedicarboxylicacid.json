        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound could be considered as cyclohexane, which has a melting point of approximately 6.5\u00b0C. Two carboxylic acid groups attached to the cyclohexane ring will significantly increase the melting point. Carboxylic acids have a strong capability to form hydrogen bonds which leads to a higher melting point. Also, the trans-configuration of the dicarboxylic acid groups on the cyclohexane ring may result in a more stable and tightly packed crystal lattice as compared to the cis-configuration. Since each carboxylic acid group can potentially raise the melting point by a significant amount (an estimated 100-150\u00b0C per carboxylic group due to the extensive hydrogen bonding possible between molecules), we can predict an additive effect. There may be additional stabilization due to the rigidity of the trans-cyclohexane ring which can further increase melting point.",
        "Prediction": "[(Cyclohexane base: 6.5) + (Carboxylic acid groups: 2 x 150)] = Approximately 307\u00b0C",
