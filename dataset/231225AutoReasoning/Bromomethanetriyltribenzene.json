        "Reason": "The presence of a benzene ring contributes to the melting point with its aromatic stability and substantial intermolecular interactions. The basic benzene unit has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group typically increases the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces caused by a larger molecular surface area, which can be estimated as an addition of around 20 degrees Celsius per methyl group. However, in the given compound, instead of additional methyl groups, we have two additional benzene rings connected through a bromomethane linker. Bromine is a heavy and highly electronegative atom, which will increase intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, raising the melting point significantly more than a methyl group would. Each additional benzene ring would also incrementally increase the melting point due to added pi-pi stacking and van der Waals interactions. Estimating the effect of each additional benzene ring could be around +20 degrees Celsius, similar to a methyl group, and bromine could add approximately +50 degrees Celsius due to its size and electronegativity.",
