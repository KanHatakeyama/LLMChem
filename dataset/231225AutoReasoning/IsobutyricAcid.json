        "Reason": "The basic unit, acetic acid, has a melting point of 16.6 degrees Celsius. The isobutyl group, which is a branched alkyl group, tends to lower the melting point because it disrupts the crystal packing of the molecules, making them less stable in a solid state. The effect of the isobutyl group (compared to the methyl group in acetic acid) can be estimated to lower the melting point by about 60 to 70 degrees Celsius. Therefore, accounting for the difference in molecular symmetry and steric hindrance, which can result in weaker intermolecular forces and less efficient packing, the melting point is lowered significantly.",
