        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 4-Cyclohexylamino-chromen-2-one, we need to address the influence of its constituent functional groups. Starting with the core structure, chromen-2-one (a chromone derivative), has a melting point typically in the range of 130 to 200 degrees Celsius, largely due to the fused aromatic ring system which makes the molecule more rigid, alongside the ketone which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The amino group connected to a cyclohexyl contributes to increased melting point due to its ability to act as a hydrogen bond donor and the introduction of a bulky substituent which leads to higher molecular weight. However, the nonaromatic cyclohexyl group may slightly reduce the overall symmetry compared to an aryl group. We can estimate the effect of the amino group attached to cyclohexyl to increase the melting point by approximately 20-30 degrees Celsius. Overall, due to the rigidity of the chromen-2-one core and the additional intermolecular hydrogen bonding, along with the cyclohexylamino substituent, we estimate a significant increase in melting point relative to unsubstituted chromen-2-one.",
