        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Each bromine substition substantially increases the melting point due to increase in molecular weight and enhancement of intermolecular forces, particularly dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces. A single bromine substituent increases the melting point of bromobenzene to 89 degrees Celsius. Given that effect, the addition of each further bromine is estimated to raise the melting point by a lesser amount because the increase in molecular weight has diminishing returns as the molecule gets larger. However, the symmetrical substitution pattern in 1,3,5-tribromobenzene can create a more crystalline solid with stronger intermolecular forces, leading to a higher increase than a second or third bromine in less symmetric positions. Each additional Br may contribute around 15 degrees Celsius per substituent beyond the first.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of bromine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the enhancement of intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces. Bromobenzene, with one bromine atom, has a melting point of 89 degrees Celsius. Each additional bromine in a symmetrical pattern, like in 1,3,5-tribromobenzene, may increase the melting point more than an asymmetrical pattern due to better crystal packing and stronger intermolecular forces. The second and third substitutions with Br are estimated to contribute less incrementally than the first because of the diminishing returns with increasing molecular size, but the symmetrical substitution may still lead to a higher melting point increment. The incremental increase for the second and third bromine atoms is estimated to be around 16.25 degrees Celsius each.",
