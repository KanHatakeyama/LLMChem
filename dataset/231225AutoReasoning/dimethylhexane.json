The effect of one additional methyl group in such branched alkanes can be estimated to raise the melting point by about +3-5\u00b0C per methyl group due to steric hindrance offset by increased symmetry.

Methyl group branching typically raises the melting point as it introduces steric hindrance, and tends to make the molecule more spherical, thus improving the packing in solid state which can lead to higher melting points. However, the influence of each methyl group can't be simplified to such a high increment as there are diminishing returns due to the increasing bulk. A more cautious estimate might be around +5\u00b0C per additional methyl group. Therefore, two extra methyl groups would increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit here is n-hexane, which normally has a melting point of around -95\u00b0C. When looking at the effects of functional groups, the two methyl groups on the third carbon could affect the melting point in several ways. Firstly, branching tends to decrease the melting point of an alkane because it makes the molecule less able to pack efficiently in a solid state, which in turn weakens the intermolecular forces. This effect might decrease the melting point roughly by about 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C per methyl group compared to n-hexane. There is a cumulative effect, but the second methyl group may not decrease it as much as the first one did since after a certain level of branching, additional groups have a diminished effect. Therefore, a rough estimate might be a decrease of about 40\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C from n-hexane\u2019s melting point due to both methyl groups.",

The effect of one methyl group could be estimated to decrease the melting point by about 10\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C. With two methyl groups, the compound has enhanced branching, which may further decrease the melting point, although the effect of the second group is less pronounced than the first due to diminishing returns in the impact of additional branching.
