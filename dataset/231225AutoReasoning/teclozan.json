        "Reason": "The compound teclozan has multiple functional groups that contribute to its melting point. Starting with the basic structure of the phenyl group (analogous to benzene), which has a reference melting point around 5\u00b0C for benzene itself. The phenyl group is substituted with multiple groups in teclozan: two chloromethyl carbonyl (C(Cl)C(=O)-), two N-ethoxyethoxy methyl groups (N(CCOCC)-), and an additional nitrogen in the ring (CN-). Each Cl on the methyl carbonyl can be considered to add about +40\u00b0C due to its electronegativity and mass, adding +80\u00b0C in total for the two Cl present in each chloromethyl carbonyl group. The carbonyl (C=O) group provides additional rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C to the melting point for each of its two occurrences. The N-ethoxyethoxy methyl groups likely make the molecule more complex and increase the molecular weight, each possibly adding around +20\u00b0C. The introduction of the nitrogen in the ring can also potentially increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and involvement in extra hydrogen bonding, estimated to add an additional +10\u00b0C. Adding these contributions together gives us the predicted melting point.",

        "Reason": "The compound teclozan has multiple functional groups affecting its melting point. Starting with the basic phenyl group as a reference, similar to benzene with a melting point around 5\u00b0C. The phenyl group is substituted with various functional groups: four chloromethyl groups (two per chloromethyl carbonyl group, -C(Cl)C(=O)-), two carbonyl groups (C=O), two N-ethoxyethoxymethyl groups (-N(CCOCC)-), and an additional nitrogen within the aromatic ring (-CN). Each chlorine on the methyl group typically raises the melting point by about +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and polarity, for a total of +80\u00b0C for the four chlorines. Carbonyl groups can increase the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds; each may contribute around +20\u00b0C, giving +40\u00b0C in total for the two carbonyls. The N-ethoxyethoxymethyl groups will contribute due to higher molecular weight and possible hindrance or weak intermolecular interactions; each may add approximately +5\u00b0C, for a total of +10\u00b0C. The nitrogen in the ring could contribute to hydrogen bonding and improves rigidity, possibly adding around +5\u00b0C. Adding all these modifications to the reference melting point of benzene yields the predicted melting point.",
        "Prediction": "5 (basic benzene structure) + 80 (four chlorines on methyl groups) + 40 (two carbonyl groups) + 10 (two N-ethoxyethoxymethyl groups) + 5 (nitrogen in the ring) = 5 + 80 + 40 + 10 + 5 = 140\u00b0C",
