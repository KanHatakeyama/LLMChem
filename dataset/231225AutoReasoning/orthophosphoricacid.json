        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is water (H2O) with a melting point of 0\u00b0C. Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) has a higher molecular mass and strong hydrogen bonding capabilities due to three hydroxyl (OH) groups and a phosphate (PO4) group, all of which contribute to a significantly higher melting point. Each hydroxyl group could potentially increase the melting point by approximately 40\u00b0C due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and the presence of the phosphate group provides both a larger molecular framework and additional hydrogen bonding, potentially increasing by around 60\u00b0C. However, as we are predicting a value lower than each of these increments, the offsetting effect is likely due to the arrangement of the hydroxyl groups and their interaction with the phosphate which somewhat limits the extent of hydrogen bonding when compared to separate OH functionalities not bonded to a central atom.",
