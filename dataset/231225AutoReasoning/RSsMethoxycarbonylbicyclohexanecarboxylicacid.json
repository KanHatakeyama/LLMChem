        "Reason": "The target compound contains several functional groups that influence its melting point. The bicyclic structure creates a rigid framework that generally raises the melting point due to the compound having a more defined crystal lattice, compared to acyclic compounds, this can be estimated to increase the melting point by +50 degrees. A carboxylic acid group typically raises the melting point through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, on average, by about +40 degrees due to dimerization in the solid state. An ester group is generally less capable of hydrogen bonding compared to a carboxylic acid and could be predicted to raise the melting point by +20 degrees as it still allows for some dipole-dipole interaction. Starting with a baseline for simple hydrocarbons near room temperature, around 25 degrees, we can add the effects of the functional groups.",
