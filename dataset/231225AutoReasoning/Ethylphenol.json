        "Reason": "The basic unit phenol has a melting point of 43 \u00b0C. The ethyl group typically lowers melting points due to disrupting the crystal lattice, which can be estimated at -40 (for causing the solid structure to be less tightly packed and more able to become liquid). Moreover, the ortho position of the ethyl group adjacent to the hydroxyl will increase molecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, adding +10 (less pronounced than in para- or meta-positions due to steric hindrance), the net effect is -30.",
