        "Reason": "The compound 4-(2-chlorophenyl)-3-thiosemicarbazide consists of several functional groups that influence its melting point. The base structure is a benzene ring, which if unsubstituted, commonly has a relatively low melting point. Substitutions on the ring can increase the melting point due to added mass and potential for intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole forces. In this case, we have a chlorine atom and a 3-thiosemicarbazide group attached to the benzene ring. The chlorine atom, being electronegative, introduces dipole-dipole interactions and slightly increases the mass of the molecule which can reasonably increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C. The 3-thiosemicarbazide group is larger and more polar compared to a chlorine atom; it contains both a thiourea and an amine group which can form hydrogen bonds, vastly increasing the intermolecular forces present, thus raising the melting point significantly. The combined effects of these substituents and the potential for hydrogen bonding can add roughly 100\u00b0C to the base melting point of benzene. Additionally, it's important to account for symmetry and crystal packing effects, which further stabilize the structure and increase melting point. Assuming benzene has a reference melting point close to 5.5\u00b0C, the adjustments for the substituents are as follows:",
        "Prediction": "Base benzene: 5.5 + Chloro group: +20 + 3-Thiosemicarbazide group: +100 + Symmetry/Crystal packing: +12.5 = 138.0\u00b0C",
        "Prediction(integer)": 138.0
