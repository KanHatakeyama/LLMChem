        "Reason": "Starting with pyrazine, which has a melting point of around 55\u00b0C. Adding chlorine atoms to an aromatic ring generally increases melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular interactions like dipole-dipole forces. Chlorine is a relatively heavy substituent, which could suggest an increase of approximately +10\u00b0C per chlorine atom. However, adding substituents can also increase molecular symmetry in some cases, impacting the efficiency of crystal packing, which could lead to a more complicated relationship between substituent and melting point. In this case, chlorines are positioned at 2 and 6, which preserves some symmetry and could mitigate the expected increase due to added molecular weight and intermolecular forces, but it is unlikely to perfectly offset the increase as a more symmetric molecule might. Therefore, a more modest increase of approximately +5\u00b0C per chlorine might be predicted.",
