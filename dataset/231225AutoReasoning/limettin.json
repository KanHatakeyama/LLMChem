        "Reason": "The basic unit of limettin can be considered as benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of three methoxy groups (\u2013OCH3) in limettin generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and the possibility of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the methoxy oxygen and protons from other molecules, contributing with +15\u00b0C per each methoxy group. The acetyl (\u2013OC(=O)\u2013) group also increases the melting point by contributing rigidity and possible hydrogen bonding interactions, estimated to give an additional +30\u00b0C. Combining these effects, the overall increase in melting point is expected to be sizable.",
