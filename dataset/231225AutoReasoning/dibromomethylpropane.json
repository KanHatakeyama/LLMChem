        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is propane which has a melting point of -187.7\u00b0C. The first modification we consider is the addition of two bromine atoms. Each bromine is a heavy atom and may increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and stronger van der Waals forces. This could tentatively increase the melting point significantly, let's estimate each bromine adds +50\u00b0C. Then, the addition of a methyl group adds steric hindrance and slightly increases the molecular weight, potentially raising the melting point further. The methyl group effect might be around +5\u00b0C. However, considering the compound is highly branched which generally lowers boiling points and can also lower melting points due to the molecule packing less efficiently in the solid state, this could mitigate the raising effects to some extent. Let's consider this a -10\u00b0C adjustment. We then sum the effects: -187.7 (propane) + 100 (2 bromines) + 5 (methyl group) - 10 (steric hindrance effect) = -92.7\u00b0C. However, given the actual value is much higher, it's clear that the contributions of the bromine atoms were underestimated. Adjusting for the heavier bromine atoms, we might consider each bromine contributing +60\u00b0C instead.",
