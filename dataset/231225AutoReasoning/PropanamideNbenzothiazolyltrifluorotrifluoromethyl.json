        "Reason": "The compound N-2-benzothiazolyl-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide is relatively complex and consists of several different functional groups that affect the melting point in various ways. We'll analyze the effects of these groups based on a basic propanamide structure. Propanamide itself has a melting point around 81-84\u00b0C. Firstly, the benzothiazolyl group, a heteroaromatic system, provides significant rigidity to the molecule and increases the potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, typically adding around 40-60\u00b0C to the melting point of a compound. Secondly, each trifluoromethyl (-CF3) group, due to its electronegativity and bulkiness, tends to increase the melting point significantly, often by about 20-30\u00b0C per group. Considering there are two such groups, this could add approximately 40-60\u00b0C. Lastly, we must consider the influence of the amide group. The amide linkage typically contributes to the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding; however, since the basic propanamide already accounts for this effect, it will not be included in the additive effects. Adding these contributions together, we predict an increase of about 80-120\u00b0C on top of the base value of propanamide.",
