        "Reason": "The molecule D-sorbose is an aldohexose carbohydrate with four hydroxyl (-OH) groups and one aldehyde group (-CHO). To predict the melting point we can start with a reference compound and then adjust based on functional groups and molecular structure. Starting with a reference compound such as glucose, which has a melting point around 146\u00b0C, we can consider the effects of the functional groups. Each hydroxyl group is capable of forming hydrogen bonds which typically increases the melting point slightly. Since D-sorbose is a structural isomer of glucose, with the same molecular formula but different arrangement of atoms, and considering that hydrogen bonding is the main interaction, we expect it to have a similar melting point to glucose. We may not see a significant change in the melting point due to the arrangements of hydroxyl groups since these are already taken into account with glucose. Aldehyde groups do not substantially affect the melting point when compared to hydroxyl groups since both are capable of hydrogen bonding.",
