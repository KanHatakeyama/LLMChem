        "Reason": "The compound 2-(benzoyloxy)acetamide is composed of an acetamide base, benzoyl group, and an ether linkage. The basic molecules for reference could be acetamide with a melting point of around 82 degrees Celsius and benzoic acid with a melting point around 122 degrees Celsius. The benzoyl group is aromatic and bulky, providing significant rigidity, which generally increases the melting point due to more orderly packing in the solid state (+40). The ether linkage (-OCO-) introduces rotational freedom but also can enable additional dipole interactions, thus providing a mild increase in melting point compared to a simple alkyl chain (+5). The amide functional group in acetamide allows for strong hydrogen bonding, which is also present in our target molecule. Therefore, we assume it doesn't change the melting point significantly, affecting it by only 0 to 5 degrees. Combining these considerations together with the base acetamide molecule: 82 (acetamide) + 40 (benzoyl group) + 5 (ether linkage) = 127 degrees Celsius.",
