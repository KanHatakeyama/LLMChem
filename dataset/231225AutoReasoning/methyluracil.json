        "Reason": "The base unit, uracil, has a melting point of around 338 K (65 \u00b0C). Each functional group will either increase or decrease this value. The two keto groups (=O) contribute to stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point, approximatively +100 degrees each. The presence of a methyl group (CH3-) typically lowers melting points due to its electron-releasing properties which can weaken hydrogen bonds, we estimate this effect to be -40 degrees. The two amine groups (substituted by N-H instead of C=O) are expected not to alter the melting point significantly compared with the keto groups since they can still participate in hydrogen bonding, so no change is predicted for those.",
