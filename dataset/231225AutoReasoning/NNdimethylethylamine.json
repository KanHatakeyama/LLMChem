        "Reason": "The base unit for comparison could be ethane, which has a melting point of -183\u00b0C. The addition of a nitrogen atom (to make ethylamine) introduces a site for hydrogen bonding, which could raise the melting point. However, the subsequent introduction of two methyl groups in place of hydrogen atoms on the nitrogen (to make N,N-dimethylethylamine) would reduce the potential for hydrogen bonding. Methyl groups could also contribute to a slight increase in van der Waals forces due to the increased molecular size, but overall, the effect on the melting point would not be as significant as the loss of hydrogen bonding capacity. Therefore, the influence of two methyl groups and the amine functional group is as follows: Amine group: +20\u00b0 C based on increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding (though much less than without the methyl groups). Each methyl group: -5\u00b0 C due to the decrease in hydrogen bonding capacity and slight increase in van der Waals forces.",

The addition of an amine group in ethylamine would likely increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding. However, the subsequent alkylation with two methyl groups reduces the hydrogen bonding capacity. Each methyl group has a small increment due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions but a larger decrement because it reduces the amine's ability to engage in hydrogen bonding. Therefore, the balance of effects can be estimated quantitatively. Considering that primary amines have higher melting points, the loss of hydrogen bonding due to N-methylation can lead to a significant drop. The amine group (without the N-methylation): +20\u00b0C based on potential for hydrogen bonding. However, each methyl group: -40\u00b0C because it eliminates two potential hydrogen bonds (one for each hydrogen replaced on the nitrogen). The relatively high reduction is due to the important role that hydrogen bonding plays in the melting point of amines.",
