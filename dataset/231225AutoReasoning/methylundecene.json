        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is ethene, which has a melting point of -169\u00b0C. The presence of a long alkyl chain, in this case a decyl group (+C10H21), increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and London dispersion forces, but the akene (-CH=CH-) bending decreases the melting point due to the introduction of a double bond and the hindered rotation which reduces molecular compactness. For the alkyl side chain, every additional -CH2- group in a saturated hydrocarbon chain typically increases the melting point by about +2\u00b0C, so for ten additional -CH2- groups, this would be an increase of +20\u00b0C. The methyl group attached to the double bond slightly increases the melting point as it adds to molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, let's estimate this as +5\u00b0C. However, the terminal double bond, compared to a completely saturated hydrocarbon, could decrease the melting point due to less efficient packing; we may estimate this decrease to be around -5\u00b0C. Combining these effects we get: -169 (ethene base) + 20 (decyl group) + 5 (methyl group) - 5 (double bond influence) = -149\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 2-methyl-1-undecene, consider the following: base structure of undecene (11 carbons) with one double bond would generally lead to a lower melting point due to less efficient packing compared to saturated hydrocarbons. A methyl group attached at the 2-position could cause a slight increase in the melting point due to a small increase in molecular weight and steric hinderance affecting crystal packing. However, the influence of the double bond is likely more significant. An alkene like 1-undecene is expected to have a melting point somewhere below room temperature. Estimating the effects quantitatively: Base structure (undecene): < 0 (due to unsaturated nature), Methyl group: +5 (slight increase due to molecular weight and steric effects), Double bond: -5 (reduces melting point due to geometric constraints on packing), Summation leads to the prediction of the melting point.",
