        "Reason": "The basic unit for 4-phenyl-2-chlorophenol can be considered as benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The phenol (OH) group generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which can add approximately +40 to +60\u00b0C. A chloro substituent (Cl) on the benzene ring also tends to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and polarity, adding around +20 to +30\u00b0C. An additional phenyl group contributes to the increase in melting point due to a larger molecular size, \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, and van der Waals forces, which would add around +15 to +25\u00b0C. Therefore, each functional group effect (the OH group, the Cl group, and the additional phenyl group) will add to the base melting point of benzene.",
