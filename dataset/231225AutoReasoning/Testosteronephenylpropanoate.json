        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of testosterone phenylpropanoate, we start with the basic steroid structure of testosterone which has a melting point around 155. Now we add in the effects of the phenylpropanoate ester:\n- Phenyl group (~-21 due to the rigid planar structure potentially aiding in closer stacking of molecules, but the benefit of this could be reduced due to the ester linkage)\n- Ester group (aliphatic three-carbon linker) (~-18 for the flexibility added by the linker which disrupts crystalline packing)\nOverall, we would expect the phenylpropanoate to lower the melting point of the core steroid structure. \nThe prediction takes into account the subtraction of these values from the testosterone base melting point.",
