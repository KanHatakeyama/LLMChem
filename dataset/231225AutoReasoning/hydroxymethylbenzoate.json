        "Reason": "The compound 4-hydroxy methyl benzoate contains several functional groups that influence its melting point: a benzene ring, a hydroxyl group (-OH), a carboxylate ester function (-COOCH3), and a methoxy group (OCH3). Starting with the base benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, the additional functional groups will modify this value. The hydroxyl group generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which might contribute approximately +80 \u00b0C. The ester function is a polar group that also increases the melting point, however, it does not participate in hydrogen bonding like the -OH, so its effect might be less, around +40 \u00b0C. The methoxy group might contribute marginally due to weak dipole interactions, let's approximate it as +5 \u00b0C. The individual effects have to be considered in concert, not in isolation, because they can influence each other's impact on the physical properties of the compound.",
