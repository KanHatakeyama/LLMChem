        "Reason": "The basic structure for predicting the melting point of 5,5-diphenylhydantoin involves comparing it to the melting point of a simpler heterocyclic compound, hydantoin. Hydantoin has a melting point of about 220\u00b0C. The effects of functional groups and structural changes can be added to this base value to approach the actual melting point of 5,5-diphenylhydantoin. Each phenyl group adds significant rigidity and \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction potential, which usually increases the melting point considerably. An appropriate estimation for each phenyl group effect might be around +35\u00b0C. Additionally, the substitution at C2 (where the phenyl groups are attached to the hydantoin core) likely facilitates more efficient packing in the crystal lattice due to symmetry, providing another incremental increase. This could be estimated at around +6\u00b0C. Adding up these changes gives an estimated melting point.",
