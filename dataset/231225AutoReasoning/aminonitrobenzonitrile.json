        "Reason": "The target compound 4-amino-3-nitrobenzonitrile is made up of a benzene ring as the basic unit with three substituents: an amino group (-NH2), a nitro group (-NO2), and a nitrile group (-C#N). Each of these functional groups has its own effect on the melting point. The benzene ring has a characteristic melting point around 5.5 degrees Celsius. The amino group is known to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which typically increases the melting point significantly, estimated as a +80 increase. The nitro group is also a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can further increase the melting point due to strong intermolecular attractions, adding about +60. The nitrile group is polar and may contribute to solid-state interactions, but its influence on the melting point is less pronounced than that of amino and nitro functional groups, estimated as a +15 increase. Combining these effects, the sum impact should result in a significantly increased melting point from the basic benzene unit.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (benzene) + 80 (amino) + 60 (nitro) + 15 (nitrile) = 160.5",
