        "Reason": "Starting with the basic phenol structure, which has a melting point around 41\u00b0C, we consider how the functional groups in 4-fluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenol influence this value. The hydroxyl (OH) group is a part of the basic phenol structure and does not change the comparison baseline. The fluorine atom at the para-position likely increases the melting point due to the induction of electron-withdrawing effects, which stabilizes the molecule and increases intermolecular attractions (+10\u00b0C). The trifluoromethyl group is highly electronegative and bulky, which also contributes to increased molecular stability and intermolecular forces, further increasing the melting point (+20\u00b0C).",
