        "Reason": "The compound in question is deuterated methane (CD4). Regular methane (CH4) has a melting point of -182.5 degrees Celsius. Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen that has roughly twice the mass. The larger mass of deuterium generally results in stronger intermolecular forces compared to hydrogen, due to a reduced zero-point energy and the potential for stronger van der Waals interactions. However, the increased mass does not significantly raise the boiling or melting points since the overall molecular shape and electron distribution are not dramatically altered. The effect of each deuterium atom on the melting point of methane can be considered minimal. If we estimate that each deuterium substitution would lead to a small increase, we might assume an increase of approximately 0.1 degrees Celsius per deuterium atom.",
