        "Reason": "The compound consists of two major functional units: a 4-nitrophenyl group and a glucose moiety configured in a pyranose form. The 4-nitrophenyl group, being aromatic and with an electron-withdrawing nitro group, would tend to increase the melting point compared to benzene. Benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces strong intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, which significantly increase the melting point. There are also additional intermolecular hydrogen bonds possible between the hydroxyl groups of the glucose moiety and the oxygen atoms in the nitro group or other hydroxyl groups, which will also increase the melting point. The multi-hydroxl groups in the glucopyranoside create a highly polar and hydrophilic structure. Based on the effects of these groups, a rough quantitative estimate for the increase in melting point can be proposed. Benzene's melting point (5.5 degrees Celsius) can be used as a base. The addition of a nitro group to a benzene ring would increase the melting point by approximately +80 to +100 degrees Celsius. The glucopyranoside structure can be considered to add a similar or greater effects due to extensive hydrogen bonding capabilities; therefore, I estimate an effect between +110 to +130 degrees Celsius.",

        "Reason": "The compound ?-d-glucopyranoside, 4-nitrophenyl, combines an aromatic ring with a nitro substituent and a glucopyranoside moiety. Benzene as a starting point has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro group significantly enhances the melting point due to strong intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding, which could account for an increase of around +80\u00b0C from the base structure of benzene. The glucopyranoside structure introduces multiple hydroxyl groups, which enhance hydrogen bonding even further and substantially increase the compound's melting point. Given that saccharides such as glucose generally exhibit high melting points due to extensive hydrogen bonding, a conservative increment because of the glucopyranoside moiety could be around +125\u00b0C. Combining these effects results in a predicted increase of +205\u00b0C over the base melting point of benzene.",
