        "Reason": "The structure of 4-tert-butylbenzophenone consists of benzophenone (diphenylmethanone) as the basic unit with a tert-butyl group added to the para position of one of the benzene rings. Benzophenone has a relatively high melting point due to its planar structure and ability to engage in strong intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, as well as some \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the phenyl groups. The melting point of pure benzophenone is around 48 degrees Celsius. Adding a bulky tert-butyl group increases the molecular weight and volume, which could potentially disrupt the crystal lattice leading to a decrease in melting point due to steric hindrance, which reduces the efficiency of molecular packing. However, the tert-butyl group can also provide more van der Waals forces, potentially raising the melting point slightly. These two effects are somewhat opposing, but the disruption to crystalline packing generally has a more significant effect on the melting point than the increase in van der Waals forces. Therefore, we might predict the melting point to slightly decrease.",
        "Prediction": "The effect of the tert-butyl group on the melting point of benzophenone would likely be a decrease in the range of approximately 5-10 degrees Celsius. Hence, considering the original melting point of benzophenone to be around 48, the predicted melting point of 4-tert-butylbenzophenone would be between 38 to 43 degrees Celsius.",
