        "Reason": "The compound 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone consists of two main functional groups that influence the melting point: quinone (cyclic diketone) and a hydroxyl group. The basic structure without the substituents is naphthalene, which has a melting point of 80. For the quinone group, having two carbonyl groups in conjugation with the aromatic system significantly increases the molecular rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, potentially increasing the melting point by approximately 50 degrees. The hydroxyl group also contributes to the melting point through hydrogen bonding capacity, potentially adding another 30 degrees to the melting point. Combining these factors, the predicted melting point increase from naphthalene's baseline is around 80 degrees (50 + 30) taking into consideration the effects of each functional group.",
