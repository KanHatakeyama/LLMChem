        "Reason": "For the compound 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobiphenyl, the basic unit to consider is biphenyl which has a melting point around 69\u00b0C. However, adding functional groups will modify this value: - Hydroxyl group (-OH): generally decreases the melting point due to its ability to participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding with solvents, which can disrupt the crystal lattice of the solid (-5). - Nitro group (NO2): tends to increase the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing effect and the introduction of strong dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding within the crystal lattice (+3). Thus, the overall effect of the hydroxyl and nitro groups results in a small decrease from the base biphenyl structure.",
