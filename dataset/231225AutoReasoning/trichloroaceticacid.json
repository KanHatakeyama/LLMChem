        "Reason": "Starting with acetic acid as a basic unit which has a melting point around 16 degrees Celsius, the influence of three chloro (Cl) substituents must be considered. Each chloro group increases molecular weight and induces stronger intermolecular forces due to its high electronegativity and polarizability, which generally increases the melting point. The carbonyl group (C=O) is already accounted for in the acetic acid's melting point. For trichloroacetic acid, each chloro group may contribute an increase estimated to be about 13-14 degrees Celsius to the melting point.",
