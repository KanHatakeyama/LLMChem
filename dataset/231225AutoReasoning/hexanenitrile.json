        "Reason": "Hexanenitrile consists of a basic hexane backbone with a nitrile functional group. The straight chain alkane (hexane) has a melting point of -95\u00b0C. The nitrile (cyanide) group is highly electronegative and introduces polarity to the molecule, which generally leads to higher melting points due to increased intermolecular forces, specifically dipole-dipole attraction. For a nitrile group attached to an aliphatic chain, the increase in melting point might be around +15\u00b0C due to these stronger intermolecular forces.",
