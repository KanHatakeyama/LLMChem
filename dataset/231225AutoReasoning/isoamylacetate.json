        "Reason": "Isoamyl acetate has an ester functional group with a general lower melting point compared to the corresponding carboxylic acids due to the inability to form strong hydrogen bonds as carboxylic acids do. The basic units here could be considered ethanol (-114.1) or ethyl acetate (-83.6), which have similar lengths to the carbon chain in isoamyl acetate but lack branching. The isoamyl group introduces branching which tends to lower the melting point due to less efficient packing. Branching: -5 (estimated decrease due to less efficient molecular packing).",

        "Reason": "Isoamyl acetate features an ester functional group, which is generally associated with lower melting points compared to the corresponding carboxylic acids, as they lack the ability to form as strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The ester functional group could be viewed as derived from acetic acid, which has a melting point of 16.6, with a reduction due to the esterification, typically in the range of -25 to -30. Additionally, the isoamyl group (a branched pentyl chain) introduces further branching in the molecule compared to a straight-chain structure like n-pentyl acetate, which tends to decrease the melting point as it reduces the efficiency of the molecular packing. The effect of the isoamyl group branching compared to a straight-chain pentyl group is estimated to further lower the melting point by around -5 to -10 relative to ethyl acetate, as branched chains tend to disrupt crystalline packing to a greater degree.",

The basic unit here is acetic acid, with a boiling point of approximately 118\u00b0C for reference. The ester functional group in isoamyl acetate should lower the boiling point due to the lack of hydrogen bonding. Additionally, isoamyl group is a branching alkyl chain which generally leads to a decrease in boiling point due to lower surface area and consequently weaker van Der Waals forces compared to a straight-chain isomer. Each methyl group in the isoamyl chain tends to lower the boiling point by approximately 20-30\u00b0C. Given that there are two additional methyl groups compared to butyl acetate, it is reasonable to subtract an estimated 40-60\u00b0C change due to these methyl groups.",

        "Reason": "The compound isoamyl acetate consists of an ester functional group, which typically exhibits a lower melting point than carboxylic acids due to the absence of hydrogen bonding. Esterification of acids generally lowers the melting point as the intermolecular forces are weaker when compared to acids with strong hydrogen bonds. However, the presence of the isoamyl group, which is branched, tends to increase the melting point slightly due to the bulkiness of the group, which provides more surface area for van der Waals interactions in comparison to straight chains. This increase in melting point due to the branching is typically less pronounced than the decrease due to the change from an acid to an ester. As the basic unit for consideration, we can take ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -83.6\u00b0C. However, isoamyl acetate has two additional methyl groups compared to ethyl acetate that will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The effect of each methyl group can be estimated to raise the melting point by about 5\u00b0C. Thus, with two methyl groups, the melting point increases by approximately 10\u00b0C.",
