        "Reason": "The basic unit which we compare to is cycloalkane, in this case, cyclooctane, which has a melting point of 14\u00b0C. The introduction of double bonds typically lowers the melting point because they reduce the symmetry of the molecule and make crystal packing less efficient. Each double bond in an alkene lowers the melting point in comparison to the corresponding alkane. Since we have two double bonds introduced into cyclooctane forming (1Z,3Z)-cycloocta-1,3-diene, we have to consider the cumulative effect of these two double bonds. The effect of one double bond is approximately -20\u00b0C (judging from the difference between alkanes and alkenes with similar carbon numbers). With two double bonds, we would expect a doubling of this effect, resulting in a decrease of 40\u00b0C from cyclooctane's melting point.",

Since there are two double bonds in (1Z,3Z)-cycloocta-1,3-diene, we take into account their cumulative effect.
