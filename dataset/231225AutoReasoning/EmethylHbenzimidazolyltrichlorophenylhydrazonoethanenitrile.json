The individual estimates for each group's effects are averaged values and may not exactly represent the actual influence due to potential interactions between functional groups that are not accounted for.",

The individual contributions each functional group makes to the melting point are rough estimates and might not be entirely additive due to potential synergistic or antagonistic effects between the groups.",
