        "Reason": "The basic structure quinoline has a melting point of around 23 degrees Celsius. For 2-aminoquinoline, the amino group on the quinoline core has two significant effects: (1) It increases the polarity of the molecule, leading to stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which typically raises the melting point due to higher energy required to overcome these interactions. The contribution of this could be estimated at around +80 degrees Celsius. (2) The introduction of a nitrogen atom also results in a resonant structure with an expanded conjugated system, enhancing the rigidity of the molecule, which can also increase the melting point. This effect could contribute an additional +30 degrees Celsius.",
        "Prediction": "The melting point of 2-aminoquinoline is predicted to be the sum of the base quinoline melting point and the contributions of the amino functional group. Therefore, 23 (quinoline) + 80 (hydrogen bonding of amino group) + 30 (resonance and rigidity) equals 133 degrees Celsius.",
