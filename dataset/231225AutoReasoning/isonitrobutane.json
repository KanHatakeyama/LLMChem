        "Reason": "The compound isonitrosoacetone (misnamed as isonitrobutane) has several functional groups that affect its melting point. The base structure is butane, which has a melting point around -138 degrees Celsius. The isonitroso (R2C=N-O-) group is an electron-withdrawing group due to the presence of a positively charged nitrogen and an oxygen. This can increase intermolecular interactions due to dipole-dipole forces. However, the overall molecule is still nonpolar and small which tends to lower the melting point. Based on similar isonitroso compounds, such as isonitrosopropylbenzene which has a melting point around -95 degrees Celsius, the effect of the isonitroso group is estimated to be an increase of approximately +62 degrees Celsius from the base structure of butane due to increased polarity and possible hydrogen bonding from the N-O structure.",
