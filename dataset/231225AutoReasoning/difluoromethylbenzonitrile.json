        "Reason": "Starting from benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, the introduction of halogen substituents typically increases the melting point due to the higher molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Fluorine substituents are particularly polar and increase the melting point significantly. For each fluorine, we can estimate an increase of about 20 \u00b0C. The cyano (-C#N) group with its high electronegativity and linear shape can contribute significantly to the melting point as well; however, since it promotes strong intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole interactions, but it's more rigid and linear compared to alkyl groups, the increase might be relatively less than that for fluorines. We might estimate an increase of around 10 \u00b0C for the cyano group. The methyl group (-CH3) is an electron-donating group that can slightly lower the melting point due to bulkiness and reduced symmetry; thus, we might estimate a decrease of about 5 \u00b0C for the presence of the methyl group.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (benzene) + 20 (first fluorine) + 20 (second fluorine) + 10 (cyano group) - 5 (methyl group) = 50.5",
