        "Reason": "The basic unit, hexane, has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius. The effect of branching due to the 2-methyl substitution would raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees because branched molecules tend to have higher melting points than their straight-chain isomers. The addition of a hydroxyl (OH) group at the 4-position introduces hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point. The hydroxyl group is expected to raise the melting point by about +9 degrees. Overall, the addition of these groups to hexane is expected to result in a higher melting point due to branching and the introduction of hydrogen bonding.",
