        "Reason": "The base unit for 2-methyl-3-heptanol would be n-alkane heptane, which has a melting point of -90.6. Hydroxyl (-OH) groups generally increase melting points due to hydrogen bonding capabilities; this can be estimated as +20. A methyl group slightly increases the melting point compared to just a straight chain due to a slight increase in van der Waals forces, but because of branching, which can reduce the surface area for intermolecular interactions, the net effect is small; estimate as +2. Therefore, the shift in melting points would be roughly additive for this molecule.",

        "Reason": "The base molecule here is heptane, with a melting point of -90.6. The introduction of a hydroxyl group (OH) to form an alcohol increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which typically adds about +20. Additionally, the methyl group introduces branching which generally increases melting point slightly due to increased van der Waals interactions, which can be estimated at +2. Conversely, branching also disrupts the compact packing of the molecule, which can have a slight negative effect on the melting point, but for the purpose of prediction, we will consider the +2 value from the additional van der Waals interactions to be the net effect. Combining these, we predict a melting point increase of +22 from the base heptane.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit here is n-pentane, which has a melting point of around -130\u00b0C. The isopropyl group (C(C)C) is expected to increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular size and a compact structure, which typically raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C compared to n-pentane. The hydroxyl group (-OH) is capable of hydrogen bonding, which generally increases melting points significantly; we can estimate an increase of +25\u00b0C. However, the presence of the additional ethyl branch (CC) from the primary carbon chain decreases the symmetry, which might lower the melting point slightly compared to a straight-chain molecule by about -5\u00b0C.",
