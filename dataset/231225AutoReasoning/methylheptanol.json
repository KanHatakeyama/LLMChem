        "Reason": "The base structure for the compound is heptane, which has a melting point of -90.6 degrees Celsius. The presence of a hydroxyl (-OH) group generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. However, the introduction of a tertiary carbon (in this case a quaternary due to the geminal methyl groups on the same carbon) attached to the hydroxyl group slightly reduces the hydrogen-bonding capacity because of steric hindrance. The two methyl groups increase the molecule's size and can also increase the melting point, but not as markedly as the hydroxyl group does. Hydroxyl group (on secondary carbon): +40 degrees Celsius, Tertiary/quaternary carbon: -5 degrees Celsius, each Methyl group: +2.5 degrees Celsius (two groups: +5 degrees Celsius), Prediction: Melting point of 2-methyl-2-heptanol = Base heptane (-90.6) + Hydroxyl group (40) + Tertiary/quaternary carbon (-5) + Methyl groups (5) = -50.6 degrees Celsius",
