        "Reason": "The basic unit for 1-aza-18-crown-6 can be considered as ethylene oxide, which has a melting point of -112.4\u00b0C. Each additional -CH2CH2O- unit in a crown ether significantly raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the conformational rigidity of the macrocyclic structure. However, the replacement of an oxygen atom with a nitrogen (aza) to form 1-aza-18-crown-6 slightly lowers the melting point due to the weaker N-alkyl bond compared to the O-alkyl bond. Since there are five -CH2CH2O- motifs and one -CH2CH2N- motif in the compound, we can estimate the increase in the melting point for each motif: Ethylene oxide (start with -112.4\u00b0C) + (5 x 20\u00b0C for each -CH2CH2O-) + (-10\u00b0C for the -CH2CH2N- motif).",
