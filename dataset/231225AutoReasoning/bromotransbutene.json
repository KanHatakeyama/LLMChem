        "Reason": "The base compound to consider could be ethene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. Adding a bromine atom typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and polarizability, which we can approximate this effect at around +50\u00b0C. Now the structure is asymmetrical due to the trans-configuration of the double bond which can also raise the melting point as it prevents efficient packing, however, for alkenes this is not as significant compared to straight-chain alkanes therefore the raise might be small, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. In total, adding the effects together gives us -169.2 + 50 + 5.",
