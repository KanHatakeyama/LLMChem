        "Reason": "The basic structure to consider is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Adding a five-membered ring (cyclopentane) fused to the benzene decreases melting point due to the increase in flexibility (less symmetric), estimated as -20\u00b0C. An amine group (NH2) is normally polar and can increase the melting point because of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. An estimated increase for an amine is around +30\u00b0C. However, since the amine is attached to an sp2-hybridized carbon in the aromatic system, its effect might be less pronounced, so we estimate a +20\u00b0C increase. Additionally, the sp3 carbons in the five-membered ring contribute to a slight increase due to more saturated carbon atoms, estimated as +2\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The base structure to refer to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Adding a five-membered ring (cyclopentane) fused to benzene tends to decrease the melting point because it disrupts the planarity and symmetry of benzene, reducing the crystal lattice stability, estimated effect is around -15\u00b0C. The presence of an amine group generally increases the melting point due to potential hydrogen bonding, which could be approximated as +50\u00b0C for primary amines not attached to an aromatic ring. However, the amine in indan-5-ylamine is part of an aromatic system, likely reducing its ability to engage in hydrogen bonding compared to a primary aliphatic amine, leading to a lower estimated increase, around +25\u00b0C. Lastly, the aliphatic carbons of the five-membered ring introduce slight additional rigidity compared to a fully aromatic system, but it is generally negligible in effect compared to the prior considerations, therefore it's considered to have an estimated effect of around +2\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The base structure for the target compound could be considered as indane, which is a fused ring system consisting of benzene and cyclopentane. Benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Fused ring systems tend to increase the melting point due to increased rigidity, but indane is not significantly more complex than benzene, so the increase would be moderate, let's approximate an increase by about 15 degrees Celsius due to the fused ring making it 20.5. Adding an amine group (-NH2) to the structure usually raises the melting point because it can act as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, creating a network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This effect can significantly raise the melting point. In this case, we can estimate this effect to be an additional increase of about 17 degrees Celsius, based on similar structures like aniline which raises the melting point from that of benzene by a similar amount.",
