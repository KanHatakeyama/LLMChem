        "Reason": "The base unit for the compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The amino group (-NH2) typically increases the melting point due to the introduction of hydrogen bonding capabilities; we can estimate this effect to be +80\u00b0C. The chloro group will also increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the polar nature of the C-Cl bond; this can be estimated at +30\u00b0C. The hydroxy (-OH) group, like the amino group, is capable of hydrogen bonding and will further increase the melting point; we'll estimate this at another +30\u00b0C. However, we must remember that these substituent effects are often not strictly additive due to potential intramolecular interactions and the specific geometric arrangement of the molecule. In this case, intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and amino groups could modulate the overall effect. Given this complexity, the estimated shifts may be slightly adjusted downward.",
