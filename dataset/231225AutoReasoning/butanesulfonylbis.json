        "Reason": "The basic unit here would be butane with a melting point of -138.3\u00b0C. Adding a sulfone group typically increases the boiling point and melting point due to the introduction of polar character and the possibility for dipole-dipole interactions. Each sulfone group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +90\u00b0C (sulfones are strong electron-withdrawing groups that significantly increase intermolecular forces). We have two sulfone groups attached to the butane, so we get +90\u00b0C for each, totaling +180\u00b0C.",
