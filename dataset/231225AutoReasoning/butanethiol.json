        "Reason": "The basic unit, methane, has a melting point of -182.5 degrees Celsius. Adding each methylene group (CH2) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased van der Waals forces and molecular weight. The terminal thiol group (SH) increases the melting point by about 38 degrees Celsius, due to stronger intermolecular forces, particularly hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions. The compound has one terminal methyl group (compared to methane), two additional methylene groups and one thiol group:",
