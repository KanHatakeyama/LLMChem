        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is the alkane, decane, which has a melting point of \u221230 \u00b0C. Pentadecanedioic acid has five additional CH2 groups, each contributing roughly +2 \u00b0C, due to increased molecular size and van der Waals forces. It also has two carboxylic acid groups. Each carboxylic acid contributes significantly more, approximately +70 \u00b0C, due to strong hydrogen bonding and dimerization potential. The total estimated increase is (5 * 2) + (2 * 70) = 10 + 140 = 150 \u00b0C. Starting from decane's melting point of \u221230 \u00b0C, the predicted melting point is \u221230 \u00b0C + 150 \u00b0C = 120 \u00b0C.",
