        "Reason": "The basic unit here begins with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of the acetamide functional group typically increases melting point substantially due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding and increased molecular rigidity; this could add around 150\u00b0C. Each additional phenyl group contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions due to a larger surface area, which could increase the melting point by about 10-15\u00b0C for each phenyl group. Therefore, the N,alpha-diphenyl group adds two phenyl rings. However, the effects of additional phenyl groups on the acetamide derivative are not strictly additive because the molecule's overall shape and symmetry can influence the crystal packing efficiency, which in turn affects the melting point. As such, we estimate a somewhat lower contribution from each phenyl group.",
        "Prediction": "Benzene (5.5) + Acetamide group (+150) + 2 x Phenyl groups (+20 to +30, considering diminishing returns) = 175.5 to 185.5\u00b0C",
