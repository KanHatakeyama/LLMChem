        "Reason": "The structure of endo-norborneol can be dissected into a bicyclic norbornane backbone with a hydroxyl group attached. The bicyclic structure is rigid and has significant van der Waals interactions due to its relatively larger size compared to simple hydrocarbons, which elevates its melting point. The hydroxyl group is capable of forming hydrogen bonds, which can significantly increase the melting point. Basic norbornane has a melting point of around 85 C. The hydroxyl group typically adds around +50 to +80 C to the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding. Considering these factors, the hydroxyl group's effect on the melting point should lie in this range.",
