        "Reason": "To predict the melting point shifts for 4-bromo-3-methylbenzoic acid, we need to consider the impacts of its functional groups compared to benzene (which has a reference melting point close to 5.5 \u00b0C). The added groups are a bromo (-Br), a methyl (-CH3), and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The bromo group significantly increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and size, which promotes stronger Van der Waals forces. A reasonable estimate for the bromo group's effect could be an increase of about 90 \u00b0C. The methyl group generally makes the molecule less symmetric and slightly increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and size, which in this case let's roughly estimate at +10 \u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group dramatically increases the melting point because of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. We can estimate this effect to be an increase of about 120 \u00b0C. The overall estimated increase is therefore approximately 220 \u00b0C more than the reference melting point of benzene.",
