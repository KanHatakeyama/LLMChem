        "Reason": "Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of about 5.5\u00b0C. Each additional phenyl group adds about +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. The -NH2 (amine) groups collectively add about +80\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding capabilities and increased polarity. The bromine atom adds about +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The 1,2,4-triazine ring adds about +50\u00b0C because of its nitrogen heteroatoms which strongly influence the packing in the solid state and its potential for hydrogen bonding. These shifts are not simply additive but can give an estimated sum for predicting the melting point.",
