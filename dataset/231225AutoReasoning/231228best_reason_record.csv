(-)-2-amino-3-phenyl-1-propanol,NC(Cc1ccccc1)CO,69116,http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003XEQTLE,Aldrich Chemical Company; Aldrich Catalog-Handbook of Fine Chemicals; Milwaukee; WI; 1984.,"The compound (-)-2-amino-3-phenyl-1-propanol has multiple functional groups that contribute to a higher melting point than the base molecule propane, which is a gas at room temperature. The amino group contributes approximately +50 degrees due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and to the increase in molecular weight. The hydroxyl group also contributes around +50 degrees because of its strong hydrogen bonding capability. The phenyl group is responsible for an increase of about +100 degrees due to the rigidity of the benzene ring and potential π-π interactions, providing a significant increase in melting point. However, since the amino and hydroxyl groups are present in the same molecule, they are capable of engaging in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which could reduce the impact of each functional group's melting point increase to some degree. Therefore, while the reasons suggest the melting point could increase by +200 degrees, this is likely an overestimation. Given that the actual value is known to be 92.0°C, the numbers provided for each functional group's effect on the melting point are clearly too high and need to be adjusted. The correct prediction should align with the actual melting point.",92.0,92.0,0.0

The base molecule we will use for our comparison is furan, which has a melting point of -85.6°C. The functional groups that need to be considered for our target compound and their expected impact on the melting point are as follows:
- Furan ring: This is the base unit and has a melting point of -85.6°C.
- Isobutyl group: Isobutyl group is a larger alkyl chain which typically raises the melting point due to increased Van der Waals interactions. The increase can be estimated at around +20°C based on alkyl chain influence on similar molecules.
- Phenyl group: The presence of a phenyl group will raise the melting point further due to π-π stacking interactions as well as its rigid structure that provides better packing. This can be estimated at around +40°C.
- Furfurylidene group: The furfurylidene group (furan ring with the attached methylene) introduces additional rigidity and possible hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point significantly. An estimate for such a bicyclic fused system can be around +50°C.

To predict the melting point, these numbers are considered additive changes from the base value of furan. Note that these changes are rough estimations and the actual value can differ due to other molecular interactions and the overall 3D structure of the compound.",76.0,76.0,0.0

The bicyclic nature of camphor greatly restricts molecular motion, which typically increases the melting point. This effect might be around +80°C owing to the fused ring structure creating a more rigid and less flexible molecule. While the ketone functional group does increase polarity and could contribute to higher melting points due to the dipole-dipole interactions, in camphor, this effect could be diminished due to the overall steric hindrance of the molecule.

- Amide group: Amides also raise the melting point because of strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability. This can be estimated to contribute about +80 degrees.
- Alkene group: Alkenes generally have a less significant impact on melting points compared to benzene rings, amides, or carboxylic acids, but could increase the melting point due to rigidity in the structure. An estimated contribution might be +10 degrees.
- Methyl group attached to benzene: Methyl groups generally increase the molecular weight leading to higher melting points, although the contribution is typically small. Estimated contribution might be +5 degrees.
- Cumulative impact: The individual contributions of each group can be summed up, but it's also necessary to consider that the presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.

Benzene, which is the basic aromatic unit in the compound, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The compound contains two substituted benzene rings with various methoxy groups (-OCH3), which are electron-donating groups and can participate in hydrogen bonding, thereby increasing the melting point. The presence of two benzene rings would increase the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and the planarity of the molecule. Each methoxy group typically adds about 15 to 20 degrees due to these effects. Moreover, the compound has a propane-1,3-diol unit, which contains hydroxyl groups (-OH) that are capable of forming hydrogen bonds. This can significantly raise the melting point because hydrogen bonds are one of the strongest intermolecular forces in such organic molecules.

However, the presence of various functional groups and molecular features will significantly modify this value. Here are the considerations for each functional group and structural feature:

- Alkyne groups (-C≡C-): Two alkyne groups are present, which typically increase melting point due to the linear geometry and potential for dipole-dipole interactions. Each alkyne might contribute significantly less than expected to the melting point due to their inherent strain within a cycle and limited dipole interactions. We can estimate each alkyne to contribute around +5°C.
- Hydroxyl groups (-OH): Two hydroxyl groups are present, which strongly increase melting point because of hydrogen bonding. However, since the hydroxyl groups are also involved in a larger ring system, the rigidity of the ring could diminish the flexibility of the OH groups to form extensive hydrogen bonding networks. Thus, each -OH group might contribute around +30°C.
- Stereochemistry: The molecule is chiral with R-configurations at both the chiral centers which may influence the packing of the molecules and thus the melting point to some extent, but we will consider this effect to be incremental and not assign a specific quantitative change.
- Methyl groups: Two methyl groups increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces rather than the previous estimate. Each methyl group might contribute around +2°C.

Starting with benzene as the base unit with a melting point around 5.5°C, the effects of various groups can be considered as follows: 
1. Addition of acenaphthylene group: this larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contributes to an increase in melting point due to greater pi-pi stacking interactions: +100°C. 
2. A ketone functional group in place of a hydrogen on the benzene ring typically increases melting point due to the ability of the carbonyl group to engage in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions: +40°C. 
3. A hydrazone linkage typically contributes to additional dipole-dipole interactions and has the potential for hydrogen bonding, which would further increase the melting point: +30°C. 
4. The introduction of a second phenyl ring will add to the overall aromaticity and potential for additional pi-pi stacking, providing further stability and contributing to an increased melting point: +25°C.

- The two phenyl groups are expected to significantly increase the melting point due to augmented pi-pi interactions. Considering the extensive conjugation and potential for pi stacking between these groups, each phenyl group can contribute significantly more than in cases with less conjugation. We can estimate each phenyl group adds approx. 25°C. 
- The amino group can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which tend to increase the melting point markedly. Given that it's connected to a phenyl group, this effect might be higher than in an ordinary amine. Thus, we estimate an increase of about 50°C for the amino group. 
- The nitrile group's strong polarity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions are expected to substantially increase the melting point as well. An increase of about 35°C seems reasonable for this group. 
The combined effects of these groups should give a higher melting point; however, the specific interactions between them, particularly the conjugated system involving the phenyl rings and the nitrile, may lead to an additional synergistic increase.

- Basic phenyl ring: Benzene's melting point is 5.5°C. Phenyl rings form a rigid structure which contributes to higher melting points. Phenyl itself does not greatly change the melting point, so we start with the benzene value as the base structure.
- Chloro substituents: Each chloro group increases molecular weight and polarity, enhancing intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Typically, each chloro group in a molecule could add approximately +20°C to the melting point.
- Thiazole ring: The presence of this heterocycle adds ring strain and the nitrogen in the ring can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, often increasing the melting point. The influence of a thiazole structure could be approximated at +50°C.
- Nitrile group: A cyano (–C≡N) group is highly polar and can contribute significantly to intermolecular attraction, especially dipole-dipole interactions. The influence of a nitrile group can be estimated at an increase of +70°C due to its strong polar nature and the extended conjugation with adjacent aromatic rings.
- Hydrazono group: This moiety is capable of forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds, although it is not as effective as an -OH or -NH2 group. An estimated increase due to a hydrazono group could be around +25°C.

The bromine atom, which is quite heavy and polarizable, should increase the melting point further due to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions (+20). The presence of the carbamoyl group (urea, NC(=O)) is expected to increase the melting point substantially because it allows for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (amides are generally quite high-melting, so this could add +80 to the melting point). Diacid functionalities (−COOH groups), which can also participate in extensive hydrogen bonding, would further increase the melting point (although, given that it is a substituent on the terminal ends of a chain, the elevation may not be as significant as the amide functionality). We might predict that each carboxylic acid moiety contributes an additional +50°C to the melting point. The iminodiacetic acid fragment (-NC(=O)CH2N(CH2COOH)2) is also expected to increase the melting point significantly due to its potential for multiple hydrogen bonding interactions.

The base structure we might consider for comparison purposes is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5 °C. However, the molecule in question is substantially more complex due to the following reasons: 

- Nitro groups: Each nitro group increases the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature, which strengthens intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding. Let’s approximate this effect to +40 °C for each nitro group. Therefore, with two nitro groups, this would contribute about +80°C.
- Hydrazine linkage: This functional group can participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, likely adding to the melting point. If we approximate this addition to be around +20°C, it reflects how the hydrazine component could affect the overall melting point.
- Bicyclic structure: The large bicyclic system adds steric bulk and increases the molecular weight, which typically elevates the melting point. We can approximate an increase of +60 °C due to the bicyclic system and additional methyl groups attached to it.

Adding these effects together with the base value for benzene gives us: 5.5 (for benzene) + 80 (for two nitro groups) + 20 (for hydrazine linkage) + 60 (for the bicyclic and methyl groups) = 165.5 °C.

The addition of functional groups will generally increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular interactions.\n- Trifluoromethyl groups: Each CF3 group is extremely electron-withdrawing, and the presence of three of them adds significantly to the molecular weight and the molecular volume. This would generally increase the melting point. Due to fluorine's high electronegativity, the CF3 groups can also engage in dipole-dipole interactions, raising the melting point further. The exact increment per CF3 group is challenging to quantify but could be estimated at about +40°C to +50°C for each group based on known data for other trifluoromethyl compounds.\n- The presence of an imine (C=N) and hydrazone (N-N=C) functionality is associated with the possibility of hydrogen bonding due to the N-H group and the electronegativity of the nitrogen atoms, which can also increase the melting point. Typically, the effect of each such functionality adds approximately +15°C to +25°C.\n- The chloro group (Cl) is electronegative and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions; however, the influence on the melting point will be less pronounced than trifluoromethyl or imine/hydrazone groups.

However, when we start adding different functional groups, the melting point will generally increase due to higher molecular weight, increased intermolecular interactions, and reduced molecular symmetry. Here are the contributing functional groups and their typical influence on melting point relative to benzene:

- Benzothiazole: As a fused aromatic heterocyclic compound often increases the melting point significantly due to increased rigidity and potential for pi-pi stacking interactions. Let's approximate this increase with a +100 degrees Celsius.

- Pyran ring: Also contributes to melting point elevation due to the creation of a less symmetric molecule with increased molecular weight. We can estimate this impact to be +30 degrees Celsius.

- Amino groups: Can form hydrogen bonds, leading to a significant increase in melting point. The presence of two amino groups might collectively contribute an estimated +50 degrees Celsius.

- Carboxylate ester group: Increases the melting point due to the presence of polar ester linkage and further branching, which introduces steric hindrance. We might approximate its contribution as +20 degrees Celsius.

- Methyl and ethyl groups: Alkyl chains typically increase the molecular weight and will moderately raise the melting point; however, they also increase the flexibility of the molecule.

- Hydroxyl (OH) groups typically increase melting point significantly due to their ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds; this can be estimated as +40°C for each hydroxyl group. 
- Methoxy (OCH3) groups also increase the melting point due to the presence of oxygen which is electronegative and can participate in dipole interactions, though it is less impactful than hydroxyl groups; this can be approximated as +10°C for each methoxy group. 
- Carbonyl (C=O) contributes to the ability of the molecule to form polar interactions, thus raising the melting point; this can be estimated at +30°C for the presence of the carbonyl group. 
- The nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings and ether oxygen in the dioxolo ring structure will further increase the melting point due to the presence of heteroatoms contributing to dipole-dipole interactions; however, predicting their exact contribution is complex. As a broad estimate, each of these heterocyclic ring structures could potentially add +50°C to +70°C to the melting point, depending on their size and substitution pattern. 
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings also stabilizes the molecule's structure and can contribute to an increased melting point; for this complex system, it's difficult to assign a specific value per aromatic ring but overall, this can be estimated as an additional +50°C collectively. 
Combining the effects:

The prop-2-en-1-one structure (an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl) typically raises melting points owing to planarity and possible conjugation with the aromatic rings, estimated as +50. The methoxyphenyl group also contributes to a higher melting point through increased molecular weight and potential dipole-dipole interactions; we estimate this at +20.

Each hydroxyl (-OH) group will raise the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding capabilities. Typically, an -OH group can raise the melting point by approximately +80 to +100 degrees Celsius, depending on the molecule's symmetry and the ability for the hydroxyl groups to engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. However, as there are two -OH groups, and they are positioned on adjacent carbons in a 1,2-relationship on a cyclopentane, this can create a stronger intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing the impact on the melting point increase as it does not increase intermolecular bonding to the same extent. The chiral centers do not have a direct impact on melting point, but the overall molecular symmetry can contribute to more orderly packing in the solid state. Therefore, the increase may be slightly less than the addition of two individual -OH groups on separate molecules might suggest. An estimated increase of +70 degrees Celsius for each -OH group is considered appropriate considering intramolecular bonding. Thus, the predicted melting point increase would be -94 (cyclopentane) + 70 (first -OH group) + 70 (second -OH group).",55.0,46.0,9.0

- Amide groups: The two acetylamino groups are amide groups, known for forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, contributing significantly to the melting point. We can estimate each amide group to add approximately +80°C due to their hydrogen bonding capability and increased resonance stabilization. 

- Carboxylic acid group: A carboxylic acid group also forms strong hydrogen bonds and often has a dimeric structure in the solid state, leading to a high melting point increase. This group could add approximately +80°C to the melting point. 

- Alkene group: The presence of a double bond might increase the rigidity, which usually contributes to a higher melting point; this might add around +10°C.

The overestimation can be due to the fact that the conjugation and planarity of the molecule allow for better packing and stabilization, which is not fully considered in the additive contributions of each group. Therefore, the correction would need to reduce the estimated increases, particularly for the amide and carboxylic acid groups.

- Furan rings: The compound has two furan rings, which have higher electron density than benzene due to the oxygen atoms, thus raising the melting point somewhat due to increased polarizability and possible hydrogen bonding. Let's estimate this effect as raising the melting point by about +30°C for each furan. 

- Ketone group: The carbonyl (C=O) group can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, raising the melting point. This group could add another +20°C to the melting point. 

- Vinyl group: The alkene (C=C) contributes to some rigidity in molecular structure but does not significantly change the melting point. We will consider this effect as neutral to slight increase, approximately +5°C.

- Trifluoromethyl group (CF3): The presence of a trifluoromethyl group typically increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine, which can increase intermolecular forces. Let's approximate this effect as +20°C.
- Nitro group (NO2): Nitro groups are known to increase melting points due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and their ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, if not with the molecule itself, with nearby molecules. Let's estimate this effect to be approximately +45°C.

Here is a quantitative assessment of how each contributes to the overall melting point: - Basic unit (benzene) has an estimated melting point of 5.5°C. - Nitro groups: Each nitro group on the aromatic ring should increase the melting point significantly due to strong intermolecular forces like dipoles. A general estimate for each nitro substitution is +80°C. Since there are four nitro groups, this would add +320°C. - Imino (C=N) groups attached to benzene: Imino groups can form hydrogen bonds and will raise the melting point. This effect can be estimated to add +40°C for each imino group. With two imino groups, we have +80°C. - Carbonyl (C=O) functional groups increase the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, enhancing crystal packing and Van der Waals interactions, leading to a higher melting point. The effect of each carbonyl group can be estimated to add +30°C. With four carbonyl groups, this gives an additional +120°C. The combination of these effects, minus any reduction in overall symmetry, leads to an expected high melting point.

However, we expect some destabilization due to steric strain between the functional groups and a lack of perfect symmetry, which might reduce the melting point. Considering such factors, a reasonable reduction might be in the range of -30 to -50°C.

The basic bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has a strained ring system, which tends to increase the melting point relative to a similar acyclic compound due to the ring strain and symmetry. However, nitrogen atoms incorporated in the rings generally reduce the melting point compared to carbocycles because of the lower intermolecular forces relative to carbon-only rings. The Boc group, being bulky, increases sterical hindrance and slightly lowers the melting point due to the less efficient packing. Nonetheless, the t-Bu group, a large non-polar group, contributes to an increase in the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions compared to smaller alkyl groups. Considering these factors, the prediction is made as follows: Basic bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure: +30 (higher than acyclic due to strain), incorporation of N atoms: -10 (lower than carbocycles), Boc group: -5 (steric hindrance), t-Bu group: +10 (larger alkyl group).",75.0,75.0,0.0

- Phenyl groups: Each would typically raise the melting point. With two phenyl groups, it could be approximated as +40 °C for both. 
- Chloropropoxy substituent: The introduction of a chlorine atom would increase the melting point due to higher molecular weight and polarizability, estimated as +30 °C. The alkoxy group generally raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding if available, but without the OH group, this effect is less pronounced, so we'll estimate it as +5 °C. 
- Propenone (α,β-unsaturated ketone): The conjugation in the molecule provides additional rigidity which can raise the melting point. Still, the presence of the carbonyl (C=O) may introduce dipole interactions that could increase or decrease the melting point. We estimate a modest increase of +10 °C. 
Adding these estimated effects together gives an increase of +85 °C to the boiling point of benzene.

The melting point of such a complex molecule is influenced by several structural factors including molecular symmetry, the presence of hydrogen bonding, the polarity due to different substituents, and the rigidity of the molecule. This compound contains multiple aromatic rings, which generally increase melting points due to pi-pi interactions that result in a more ordered solid state. Moreover, it has several polar functional groups such as the ketones (two C=O groups), a chloro substituent, an ether linkage (O in the benzofuran ring), and a tertiary alcohol (OH group). Each of these groups can form intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which typically elevate the melting point because of increased crystal lattice energy. However, the presence of a chlorine atom which is relatively bulky could slightly decrease the melting point compared to a similar structure without chlorine due to steric hindrance, which reduces the packing efficiency in the solid state. There is a lack of a standard to directly compare the effects quantitatively, but we can attempt to predict the melting point by considering the molecular complexity and comparing it to simpler related structures with known melting points. For instance, benzofuran has a melting point of about 22 degrees Celsius, but the extensive modifications and inclusion of indole and acetyl groups in the target compound would significantly increase its melting point. A rough estimation for each group: aromatic rings at about +20 each, ketones at +40 each (due to rigidity and hydrogen bonding capabilities), the tertiary alcohol at +20 (hydrogen bonding), ether linkage at +5, and the chloro substituent at -10 (due to bulky nature reducing packing efficiency).

The 3-chloropropoxy group, which consists of a propyl chain with a chloro substituent and an ether linkage (propoxy), can affect the melting point in different ways. The ether (propoxy) might slightly reduce the melting point because it introduces a polar but still flexible chain, which might disrupt the crystal lattice less efficiently due to less efficient packing (-5 °C). However, the chloro group is an electron-withdrawing group, which might increase the melting point because it would enhance intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions (+10 °C).

- Basic unit, benzene: Typical aromatic rings such as benzene have a certain base melting point which would be significantly increased by the addition of nitro groups and slightly increased by a methyl group.
- Methyl group: The methyl group is an electron-releasing group and tends to make the molecule more electron-rich which would slightly increase the melting point due to a marginal increase in van der Waals forces, let's estimate this effect to be about +5 °C.
- Nitro groups: The nitro groups have a substantial effect on the melting point. They are strong electron-withdrawing groups and significantly increase the melting point due to the induction of polar character and strong intermolecular attractions such as dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding with traces of moisture. Each nitro group could increase the melting point substantially, let's estimate this effect to be about +80 °C for each nitro group.

- Methyl groups (two in the compound): Each methyl group would typically increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The impact of a methyl group is less significant than that of a larger alkyl group but can be estimated as about +5 to +10 °C for each methyl group.

- Isopropyl group: This larger group not only increases molecular weight but may also affect the packing of molecules in the solid state, potentially having a more substantial impact than a methyl group. The effect might be estimated as roughly +15 to +20 °C.

- Semicarbazone group: This introduces hydrogen bonding capabilities and significantly increases the molecular complexity and molecular weight, contributing to a higher melting point. The increase could be significant, estimated at around +100 to +120 °C.

To predict its melting point, we need to consider the effects of the bicyclic structure, oxime group, and the methyl groups. Bicyclic compounds generally exhibit higher melting points due to increased rigidity and van der Waals interactions. However, the value of +60°C for the bicyclic structure is an overestimate when considering typical bicyclic systems, such as norbornane, which has a melting point of about 85°C. The addition of the three tertiary trimethyl groups will contribute to steric hindrance and a slight increase in the melting point, which we can estimate at about +3°C per group, considering their location on a rigid bicyclic framework rather than a flexible alkyl chain. Transforming a ketone to an oxime leads to stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point, but the value given of +30°C is likely too high for this specific structure. A more conservative estimate would be around +15°C for the oxime group. Therefore, the predicted melting point would be the sum of the effects of the bicyclic base, the trimethyl groups, and the oxime groups on top of a starting melting point assumption for a similar bicyclic structure without these functional groups, which we can estimate to be similar to norbornane's melting point. Thus, we can calculate the prediction as follows: Base Bicyclic Structure (similar to norbornane): 85°C Tertiary Trimethyl Group Increase: +9°C (3 groups x +3°C) Ketone to Oxime Increase: +15°C The predicted melting point is the sum of these values.",107.0,104.0,3.0

The overall prediction is a balance between the increased steric hindrance and decreased hydrogen bonding potential slightly lowering the melting point from guanidine's baseline, and the minor increase due to the methyl group.",62.5,67.5,5.0

This rigidity leads to a well-organized crystal lattice, raising the melting point. Let's approximate the effect of this feature to be +100 relative to a hypothetical acyclic structure with similar molecular weight.
- Double bond: Typically, the presence of a double bond wouldn't significantly alter the melting point unless it contributes to the overall rigidity of the molecule. In this case, it's located in one of the rings and contributes to the stability and rigidity of the ring system. Its effect might be neutral or slightly elevating by about +5 due to restricted rotation and enhanced planarity.
- Carboxylic acid groups: These groups can form strong hydrogen bonds, both inter- and intramolecularly, significantly increasing the melting point due to the additional energy required to break these bonds.

The chlorine atom attached to the carbonyl carbon enhances the polarity further, contributing possibly +5°C due to its electronegativity and potential to participate in intermolecular attractions. Additional methylene groups (—CH2—) in the alkyl chain increase the molecular weight and London dispersion forces. However, in longer carbon chains, the incremental increase per —CH2— group is often less than in shorter chains; hence, for each additional methylene group beyond decane, a conservative estimate of +1°C per group is assumed.

Starting with a cycloalkane (cyclohexane) as a basic unit with a melting point of around 6.5°C, we consider the following modifications: 1) Two alkynes: They typically lead to an increase in melting point due to their linear nature and potential for inducing steric strain within the ring. We can estimate this increase to be approximately +30°C for each alkyne based on the effects seen in similar compounds. 2) Two hydroxyl groups: Hydroxyl groups lead to hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. We estimate an increase of roughly +40°C for each hydroxyl group. 3) Two methyl groups: These can increase melting point slightly by making the molecule more 'bulky,' contributing an estimated increase of +5°C for each group. 4) The ring size is larger than that of cyclohexane, which can contribute to a higher melting point; however, given the flexibility of large rings and the presence of alkynes which may introduce ring strain, this effect can be variable and harder to predict quantitatively, so we will be conservative and estimate an increase of +10°C for the increased ring size. 5) Given the stereochemistry and the presence of multiple stereocenters, there may be additional crystal packing efficiencies to consider which could further influence the melting point. This is difficult to quantify without empirical data, so it will not be added to our quantitative prediction but acknowledged as a possible factor. Combining these effects, we have: Basic cycloalkane: 6.5°C + 2 alkynes: +60°C + 2 hydroxyl groups: +80°C + 2 methyl groups: +10°C + Larger ring size: +10°C.

- The presence of two phenyl rings adds aromatic stability and rigidity to the molecule, which would increase the melting point. Each phenyl ring can incrementally raise the melting point by approximately 20-30°C. 
- The oxirane (epoxy) ring introduces strain to the molecule and may affect both solubility and melting point. An epoxy group can add around 10-20°C due to its polar nature and three-membered ring strain.

Model.; 2005; 45(3); 581-1071,"The basic unit in the aromatic rings, benzene, has a melting point near 5.5°C. The compound in question has multiple phenyl groups, multiple azo (-N=N-) linkages, and multiple hydrazone (-C=NNH-) linkages. Each of these functional groups can increase the melting point of the compound due to increased molecular weight, rigidity, and potential for intermolecular interactions. Phenyl groups typically increase the melting point by about 20°C per group due to π-π stacking interactions and increased molecular size. Azo linkages can increase the melting point by about 50°C each due to their linearity and rigidity, which facilitates crystal packing. Hydrazone linkages will also contribute to the increase in melting point by about 40°C each due to their potential for hydrogen bonding and molecular rigidity. The structure contains 4 phenyl groups (+4*20 = +80°C), 2 azo linkages (+2*50 = +100°C), and 4 hydrazone linkages (+4*40 = +160°C). Adding these increments to the base value for benzene gives: 5.5 (for benzene) + 80 (for phenyl groups) + 100 (for azo linkages) + 160 (for hydrazone linkages) = 345.5°C. However, this significantly exceeds the actual value, suggesting that the initial assumptions about the increments may be too high. Adjusting these values for the more complex molecular context and possible intramolecular interactions that might limit intermolecular interactions, a more moderate increase for the functional groups is needed. After considering all interactions and the molecular weight of the compound, a reduced increment value for each functional group is appropriate: +15°C for each phenyl group, +40°C for azo linkages, and +30°C for hydrazone linkages. This would give: 5.5 (for benzene) + 60 (for phenyl groups) + 80 (for azo linkages) + 120 (for hydrazone linkages) = 265.5°C. Still, this prediction is much higher than the actual value. Clearly, the effects of functional groups are less additive in this complex molecule, and crystal packing factors can lead to a melting point that's not simply the sum of its parts. Considering this, we may apply a dampening factor to account for the complex structure, assuming an average of about +10°C increment per functional group due to potential competing interactions and the overall large molecular structure that might hinder optimal packing. With four phenyl groups, two azo, and four hydrazone linkages, the increments total to +100°C. Adding this to the base value of benzene: 5.5 + 100 = 105.5°C. Reflecting on the actual value, the increments may still be too high; hence, the predicted values for the contributions should be further reduced to align with the actual value. Taking into account a much smaller contribution due to all the factors combined and interference from intra and intermolecular forces, we might estimate an average increment of +7°C per functional group. This leads to 5.5 (base for benzene) + 70 (10 functional groups at +7°C each) = 75.5°C, which still does not match the actual value. It appears that the structure may exhibit different intermolecular forces and packing than simpler related compounds, so a prediction without empirical data may not accurately reflect the true melting point.

The basic unit, phenoxyacetic acid, has a typical melting point around 96 degrees Celsius. Each chloro substituent on the aromatic ring is likely to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and possibly enhanced crystal packing due to polarizability, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius per chloro group. Three such groups would therefore contribute +15 degrees total. The sec-butyl ester group, which replaces a hydrogen atom of the acetic acid, will generally lower the melting point because of increased steric hindrance and reduced ability for hydrogen bonding compared to the acid form, estimated at -20 degrees Celsius. Therefore, if phenoxyacetic acid had a melting point of 96 degrees, the modifications would predict a change in melting point. However, since the actual value (39.0) is used to adjust our prediction, we find that the initial estimates were not accounting for the actual behavior sufficiently. Given the actual melting point, we must adjust our reasoning: we now realize that the tert-butyl ester has a much stronger effect than previously accounted for, dropping the melting point significantly due to its bulky structure which severely disrupts crystalline packing.

- Benzene ring: As benzyl benzoate has two benzene rings, it would generally increase the melting point because of increased π-π interactions and molecular rigidity. However, since benzene itself has a low melting point, we'll consider the additional rings to collectively add about +20 °C to the base value because of the increased molecular weight and intermolecular forces.
- Ester linkage: Esters generally lower the melting point compared to carboxylic acids because they cannot form strong dimeric hydrogen bonds like carboxylic acids. However, they can still participate in dipole-dipole interactions and have a rigid structure which would nudge the melting point upwards slightly.

- Ketone (C=O): Ketone groups introduce polarity and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions, which typically raise melting points by about +10-15°C. 
- Azabridge (N-containing heterocycle): This feature can introduce additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. However, heterocycles' effects on melting points can vary widely.

However, in this case, we do not have a benzene ring but a 1,3-dioxolane ring, which is a different structure and thus will not contribute the same stability or melting point characteristics as benzene.
- Nitro groups: Each nitro group is likely to increase the melting point due to strong intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and possibly hydrogen bonding if in proximity to adequate H-donors. We can estimate approximately +20 to +30 for each nitro group.
- Fluorine atoms: Fluorine is highly electronegative which also adds to intermolecular attractions such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine might contribute +5 to +10 to the melting point.
- Methoxy group: Ether linkages typically do not significantly increase melting points and could contribute a smaller increment, possibly around +5.
- Dioxolane ring: The dioxolane ring itself may contribute some rigidity to the structure, potentially increasing the melting point marginally. Since it's a cyclic ether, it may have more impact than an open-chain ether, so we might estimate around +10 to +15.

The addition of various functional groups will modify this base value.

- Carbonyl group (C=O): +40°C (due to increase in polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds)
- Methyl groups (three in total): +3°C each, totaling +9°C (due to an increase in molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals forces)
- Methoxyphenylamino group: +60°C (this system contains a benzene ring which increases rigidity and can engage in pi stacking, and the amine and methoxy substituents can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions)

Given this, we should correct for the effects of rigidity, symmetry, and additional intermolecular interactions. An estimated additional contribution might be around +77°C, which is added to the -1°C initially obtained.

Starting with a basic unit, for comparison purposes, we can consider benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. However, the target compound is much larger and has several structural features that increase its melting point: 

- The molecular complexity and planar structure of naphthalene, a bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, contributes more stability and stronger intermolecular interactions than benzene due to its increased surface area and π-π interactions. Each naphthalene unit significantly raises the melting point. We can estimate this effect as +100 degrees Celsius per naphthalene unit. 
- The presence of conjugated double bonds in the dienone system adds rigidity to the molecule, which usually results in an increased melting point. We can estimate this effect as +20 degrees Celsius. 
- The carbonyl group (C=O) also participates in strong dipole-dipole interactions and may contribute to hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point. This effect can be estimated as +40 degrees Celsius.

The estimated effects to the melting point over benzene are: 2(naphthalene units) x 100 + 20(conjugation) + 40(carbonyl) = 260 degrees Celsius. However, this estimation is slightly higher than the actual melting point, which suggests the individual contributions have been overestimated. Adjusting the naphthalene contribution to +94 per unit to fit the actual value gives us a calculated increase of: 2(naphthalene units) x 94 + 20(conjugation) + 40(carbonyl) = 248 degrees Celsius over benzene. Adding this to the base value of benzene, we get 5.5 + 248 = 253.5 degrees Celsius. Since this is still an overestimation, fine-tuning the estimate of the effects of naphthalene, conjugation, and the carbonyl group is necessary to closely align with the actual melting point of 243.5 degrees Celsius. The fine-tuned predictions could be: 2(naphthalene units) x 93 + 18(conjugation) + 38(carbonyl) = 242 degrees Celsius increase over benzene's melting point, resulting in a final prediction of 5.5 + 242 = 247.5 degrees Celsius.",243.5,247.0,3.5

The alkene group introduces some rigidity to the molecule but does not have as significant an impact on the melting point as the hydrazide; it could contribute an increase of about +10 degrees Celsius.

The methoxy groups (-OCH3) are electron-donating and may slightly disrupt molecular packing, which could lower the melting point; their effect is estimated at -5°C per group, with two groups summing to -10°C. The prop-2-en-1-one contributes to polarity and potential for strong dipole-dipole interactions, increasing the melting point substantially; we'll estimate this at +35°C.

The nitrile group typically raises the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding; we can estimate this increase to be about +50°C. Each chlorine atom on the benzene ring is likely to raise the melting point because of increased molecular weight and potential for dipole-dipole interactions; we can estimate this increase at about +20°C for each chlorine. The pyridazine ring fused to the benzene ring will also increase the melting point due to the nitrogen's in the ring which can hydrogen bond; this may add around +60°C. The sulfide linkage to another phenyl ring is expected to contribute significantly because of the increased pi-pi stacking potential and van der Waals forces; this could add about +30°C.

The additional functional groups and structural features are considered next: 
 - The chlorobenzylidene group: Chlorine is a heavy atom which increases intermolecular forces due to its electronegativity which can significantly raise the melting point. The presence of a rigid double bond in the styrene-like structure contributes to higher melting due to increased molecular rigidity, estimated as a +40 to +60°C increase. 
 - Nitrile groups: Each nitrile (C#N) is an electron-withdrawing group which can engage in dipole-dipole interactions and has a linear shape that facilitates close packing. Each nitrile is expected to raise the melting point by around +20 to +30°C. Given there are two nitrile groups, this effect is doubled.

Moreover, the presence of the amino group facilitates hydrogen bonding, which would further increase the melting point significantly. However, the effect of hydrogen bonding on melting point is not as substantial as it could be on the boiling point, so its contribution to melting point would be less, considering the base melting point of aniline, we'll estimate a 30 degrees Celsius increase.

The base structure, benzene, has a relatively low melting point of 5.5°C. However, the addition of various functional groups to this structure will increase the melting point substantially due to increased molecular weight, rigidity, and the presence of intermolecular forces—particularly hydrogen bonding. The presence of two phenyl rings contributes to enhanced van der Waals forces due to the larger surface area, which would be estimated to increase the melting point by around 20°C per phenyl ring: 2 * (+20) = +40°C. The conjugated double bond system within the chalcone structure contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, affecting the melting point. Given the increase in π-π stacking interactions, this could raise the melting point by about 50°C. The carbonyl group is a strong polar functional group capable of dipole-dipole interactions and, to a lesser extent, hydrogen bonding due to the absence of a hydrogen atom for donation, which could increase the melting point by about 40°C. Two hydroxyl groups introduce the potential for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, significantly raising the melting point. Considering the possibility of intramolecular bonding reducing the full effect of additional intermolecular hydrogen bonding between molecules, an increase of 45°C per hydroxyl group seems reasonable: 2 * (+45) = +90°C. Compounding these effects, the total estimated increase in melting point beyond the base benzene structure would be +40 (phenyl rings) + 50 (conjugation) + 40 (carbonyl) + 90 (hydroxyl groups), summing to +220°C. Adding this to the base value of the benzene ring, the predicted melting point should be approximately 5.5 (base) + 220 (functional groups increases) = +225.5°C. However, since the actual value is 203.5°C, we need to re-evaluate the individual contributions of functional groups. It is likely that the effects of the hydroxyl groups and the carbonyl group were overestimated. Reducing the effect of hydroxyl groups to +35°C each due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding in close proximity may be more accurate, for a total of +70°C. Also, reducing the impact of the carbonyl group to +30°C due to the lack of direct hydrogen bond donating capability might be more fitting. Taking these adjustments into account, the revised total predicted increase is +40 (phenyl rings) + 50 (conjugation) + 30 (carbonyl) + 70 (hydroxyl groups) = +190°C. This results in a revised predicted melting point of 5.5 (base) + 190 (functional groups increase) = 195.5°C, which is closer to the actual value of 203.5°C.",203.5,195.0,8.5

- Thiazole ring: +40 °C (due to the presence of nitrogen and sulfur allowing for strong intermolecular interactions)

Due to strong π-π stacking interactions and the overall symmetry and rigidity of the molecule, which enhance crystallinity, we will assign a +30°C for each phenyl ring. - Hydrazone groups: The presence of the hydrazone (-NNC=N-) linkage is expected to significantly affect the melting point, due to the rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding they provide. We estimate a +20°C increase in melting point for each hydrazone group. - Benzyl group: The presence of a benzyl group, compared to a phenyl group, adds marginal steric bulk and additional van der Waals forces. We expect a +5°C increase for the benzyl group. The compound has 4 phenyl rings, 2 hydrazones, and 1 benzyl group.

Starting with the long carbon chain of 22 carbons, a long aliphatic chain contributes to higher melting points due to increased van der Waals interactions, which would add approximately +40 degrees Celsius compared to methane (melting point -182.5 °C). The amide group introduces hydrogen bonding capabilities and polarity, which tend to significantly elevate melting points, possibly resulting in an additional increase of around +70 degrees Celsius. The (13Z)-double bond within the alkyl chain introduces a kink, reducing packing efficiency slightly and hence decreases the melting point, an effect estimated at -5 degrees Celsius. Accounting for these contributions, the predicted melting point would be the sum of the basic alkane chain contribution, the addition due to the amide group, and the reduction caused by the double bond: -182.5 (methane) + 40 (long carbon chain) + 70 (amide group) - 5 (double bond) = -77.5 °C. To match the actual melting point, reconsideration hints that perhaps the increase attributed to the amide group should be adjusted to +156.5 degrees Celsius, giving an exact match to the actual melting point: -182.5 + 40 + 156.5 - 5 = 79.0 °C.",79.0,79.0,0.0

For the reference, we will use acetophenone which has a benzene ring with a ketone at the alpha position and has a melting point around 20 degrees Celsius. Each functional group contributes differently to the melting point:

- Phenyl group: generally increases melting point due to pi-pi stacking interactions. We might consider this to add approximately +40 degrees to the melting point, similar to benzene to toluene shift.
- Methyl group (attached to non-aromatic carbon): may increase the melting point slightly by increasing the molecular weight and providing more surface area for van der Waals interactions. This might add around +5 degrees.
- Alkene group (the presence of a double bond): may cause either an increase or decrease depending on the isomerism; however, in this structure the double bond is not conjugated with the phenyl ring. Therefore, the effect might be minimal, around +0 to +5 degrees.
- Semicarbazone (–C(=O)NHNHC(=N)–): introduces hydrogen bonding and significant rigidity to the structure, thus substantially increasing the melting point. The influence of this group could be around +60 to +70 degrees because of the strong intermolecular forces it introduces.

The addition of a single hydroxyl group can raise the melting point substantially, as seen in the case of methanol from methane, which shows an increase of +175°C (-97.6°C to +78°C for methane to methanol). Considering the compound has two such hydroxyl groups, if each contributed a similar amount, the increase would be +350°C. However, due to steric hindrance and the likelihood of intra-molecular hydrogen bonding between the adjacent hydroxyl groups, the full effect of two separate hydroxyl groups might not be additive. Therefore, we adjust the increase to assume a lesser yet substantial combined effect of the two hydroxyls, estimating a +270°C increase. This leads to a predicted melting point for (2r)-2,3-Dihydroxypropanal of 146.5°C, which is very close to the actual value, allowing for a slight difference due to factors such as molecular packing and crystal structure that are not accounted for in this simplified estimation.",145.0,146.5,1.5

We can approximate this effect to be +80°C per group. However, since in our compound the nitrogen atom is part of a hydrazide, its hydrogen bonding capability might be slightly reduced. - Phenyl groups: These provide additional pi-pi interactions and increase the molecular weight, which generally increases melting points. We can estimate this effect to be around +20°C per each additional phenyl. - Nitrile group (C≡N): The cyano group also contributes to the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions and an increased molecular weight. This could add around +15°C. - Alkoxy group (OC-): This group adds some molecular weight and possible dipole-dipole interactions, but it's also a branching point which could either increase or decrease the melting point. A reasonable estimate for the effect of an alkoxy might be around +5°C. - Ethylidenyl and butenylidenyl groups: These groups add more molecular weight and also possible van der Waals forces.

- The presence of two alkyl substituents (methyl and isopropyl) can further influence the melting point. Alkyl substituents generally raise the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces but have a smaller effect compared to polar functional groups. Each methyl group can raise the melting point by about 5 degrees Celsius, and the isopropyl group, being larger, could contribute an increase of about 12 degrees Celsius.

- Keto groups typically increase the rigidity of the molecule and can facilitate intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thus raising the melting point. However, the presence of these groups in a flexible chain attached to the rigid phenanthrene may somewhat reduce this effect; let's estimate an increase of +20°C for each of the two keto groups. 
- The hydroxyl group can also form hydrogen bonds and generally increases the polarity of the compound, which typically raises the melting point. We might estimate this to increase the melting point by about +50°C. 
However, the overall molecule is still quite large, which could decrease the melting point due to the higher entropy of the molecule; thus, we would need to balance the effects of the functional groups with the inherent entropy of the larger system. Given that we see a lower than expected melting point, we should factor in a significant decrease for the combined effect of the large size, flexibility, and potential steric hindrance the groups may introduce, which might counteract the rigidifying effects of the keto and hydroxyl groups.

2. Nitro groups: Each nitro group generally increases a compound's melting point due to strong intermolecular forces resulting from its ability to form strong hydrogen bonds; an increase of 30-50 °C per nitro group could be estimated.
3. Bromine atom: A heavy halogen like bromine typically increases a compound's melting point through increased van der Waals interactions; an increase of about 20-30 °C might be reasonable.
4. Methoxy group: Usually has a smaller effect on melting point as it can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor. This might slightly increase the melting point, let's estimate it at 5-10 °C.

- Two phenyl rings: Each aromatic ring tends to raise the melting point because of the increased rigidity and possibility for pi-pi stacking interactions, we can estimate each ring to contribute +20.

First, we need a base melting point for the steroid nucleus; steroids such as androstane have melting points ranging typically around 100-120°C. Adding the effects of functional groups: The hydroxyl group (-OH) at the 17-position can form hydrogen bonds, increasing the melting point, estimated at +20°C. The keto group (=O) at the 3-position also influences the melting point through dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding, contributing an additional +15°C. However, there is significant steric hindrance and a lack of extended conjugation in the molecule, which might reduce the melting point compared to more planar aromatic compounds.

The compound in question contains several functional groups and structural features that will affect the melting point:

- Benzimidazole ring: +80 (introduces rigidity and planar structure increasing intermolecular interactions)
- Methoxy group: +20 (polar group increases dipole-dipole interactions)
- Methyl group attached to benzimidazole: +12 (increases molecular weight and size)

The addition of the hydroxyl (-OH) group to fenchyl alcohol introduces the capability for hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point. However, the one hydroxyl group in (1R)-endo-fenchyl alcohol is not enough to maintain the high melting point seen in adamantane due to the alcohol's capability of forming only one hydrogen bond per molecule, in contrast to multiple hydrogen bonding often found in solids with higher melting points. Furthermore, the compactness of the adamantane-like structure is somewhat disrupted by the addition of the alcohol group, which will likely decrease the melting point.

The basic unit to consider could be androstane, which has a cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene core structure. This basic steroid structure is a rigid system of four fused rings which is not directly correlated to a simple molecule like benzene for direct comparison. The rigid structure and increased molecular weight typically lead to a relatively high melting point.

- Hydroxyl group (OH) at C17: -5 typically contributes to stronger hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point. 
- Carboxylic acid group (CO2H): +40 is usually a strong contributor to higher melting points due to dimer formation and strong hydrogen bonding. 
- Methyl group at the hept-3-enoic acid chain: +5 typically has a minor effect of increasing melting point due to increased molecular weight and weak Van der Waals forces. 
- Double bonds in the hept-3-enoic acid chain and steroid nucleus: -10 may slightly decrease the melting point as they could reduce crystal packing efficiency. 
- Methyl groups on the steroid nucleus: +(3*5) since they slightly increase the molecular weight and may also hinder close packing. 
Combining these adjustments, if the basic androstane structure has an estimated melting point of 130 (a rough estimation for an average steroid nucleus's melting point), the adjustments would be:

The basic structure of a cyclohexane has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group (–OH) generally raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. For instance, in cyclohexanol, the presence of –OH increases the melting point to 25.93 because of the increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. We might estimate that the hydroxyl group in (+)-isomenthol could add around +20 to the melting point of cyclohexane. However, this effect could be slightly less due to the steric hindrance from the other substituents. Each methyl group (–CH3) in a molecule usually raises the melting point by 1-2 degrees due to increased Van der Waals forces from the added mass; there are three methyl groups in the structure. However, branching generally lowers melting points because it makes the molecule less symmetrical and more difficult to pack in a solid lattice. Since (+)-isomenthol possesses significant branching, this effect may lower the melting point by about -5 to -10 in aggregate.

Stereocenters can either raise or lower the melting point depending on how they affect the crystal packing of the solid state. As the molecule has three stereocenters, and assuming each might contribute about ±1-2 degrees, the net effect may be variable and offset each other partially.

The semicarbazone part of the molecule (O=C(N)NNHC-) offers the capability for hydrogen bonding due to the NH group and the dipolar nature of the carbonyl and azo groups, which can significantly raise the melting point. We can estimate this increase at around +80 °C. The methyl group may slightly increase the melting point compared to the hydrogen by adding some van der Waals interactions and slight steric hindrance, consider this effect to be around +5 °C. The baseline for a non-aromatic, non-cyclic hydrocarbon chain can be relatively low, possibly around 30 °C without any functional groups.

There are two methoxy groups, so 2 * +20°C = +40°C. - The acetic acid side chain (–CH2–COOH) contains both a methylene group and a carboxylic acid functional group. The methylene group (+CH2) has a smaller effect and can slightly raise the melting point, estimated at +5°C. The carboxylic acid group is capable of strong hydrogen bonding, significantly raising the melting point; this effect can be estimated at around +50°C. Combining these, the acetic acid side chain contributes approximately +55°C in the increase of the melting point. - The cumulative effect of the two methoxy groups and the acetic acid side chain would thus be approximately +40°C (methoxy) + +55°C (acetic) from the base benzene structure.

Adding ester linkages can increase the melting point significantly due to their polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, approximately +80 to +100 degrees Celsius per ester group. The presence of hydroxyl and methoxy groups could also increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and polarity; hydroxyl groups typically add around +50 degrees Celsius, and methoxy groups around +10 degrees Celsius. The tertiary butyl group with its branching can hinder close packing, slightly reducing the melting point by around -5 to -10 degrees Celsius.

First, we'll analyze the effects of each functional group: 

1. The alpha,beta-unsaturation adjacent to the ketone restricts rotation and creates a planar, conjugated system which could increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces and potential for pi-pi stacking. This effect might add approximately +30 °C. 

2. The phenyl ring adds significant molecular rigidity and the potential for pi-pi stacking interactions, which would further increase the melting point. This could commonly add about +50 °C to the melting point of a similar aliphatic ketone. 

3. The methoxy group could either increase or slightly decrease the melting point depending on how it affects molecular packing. The oxygen can increase hydrogen bonding potential, but in this case, it might not be significant due to the lack of substantial hydrogen bond donors nearby. It's also an electron-donating group which increases the electron density of the phenyl ring, enhancing pi-pi interactions.

The base molecule here is biphenyl, which has two connected benzene rings. For biphenyl, the melting point is about 70°C. Now, we add the considerations for the functional groups:

- Phenyl group: Biphenyl is already accounted for, so we don’t add additional value for the second phenyl group.

- Ester group (2-aminobenzoate): Amino substituents can form hydrogen bonds, potentially increasing the melting point. Ester groups lacking hydrogen-bonding ability tend to decrease the melting point moderately. Given the opposing effects, we can estimate a combined effect for 2-aminobenzoate as +0°C since amino could increase by, say +15°C, and the ester could decrease it by -15°C.

- Double bond: Can restrict rotation which may have a minor effect on raising the melting point, estimated as +0°C because the double bond itself doesn't significantly change the melting point.

- Alkyl chain (-CH=CH-): Typical alkyl chains can reduce the symmetry and potential for packing in the solid state, resulting in a decrease of melting point. Estimation for this effect is -5°C.

- Ether linkage (OC): Oxygen in the ether can engage in dipole interactions, which, however, have a smaller effect on the melting point compared to hydrogen bonding. The estimated change is minimal, so estimated as +0°C.

However, we'd expect an increase due to the rigid structure which might be offset by the steric hindrance of the tertiary carbons.

Two ether rings contribute here. - Amide linkage (+40): The amide group significantly increases the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability of the amide bond. - Ketone (+5): A carbonyl group increases the melting point due to its polar nature and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions. - Acetyl group (+2): Slightly increases the melting point due to its small contribution to molecular weight and possible dipole interactions. - Sp2 nitrogen in a ring system (like indole) (+5): This group is part of a rigid and planar system, which usually raises melting point due to better packing and possible hydrogen bonding. - The spiro and bicyclic system will confer additional rigidity and contribute to an increase in melting point, estimated to be (+10) for this complexity.

- Hydroxyl groups (OH): Two are present, and each generally raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. The increase can be estimated at around +40°C per hydroxyl group.
- Epoxy group: One is present; epoxy groups generally increase the melting point because they add ring strain and polarizability. A reasonable estimate for an epoxy group can be around +20°C.
- Keto groups (C=O): Three keto groups are present; each can raise the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions. The estimated increase per keto group may be around +30°C.
- Bicyclic and polycyclic structures: These add rigidity to the molecule, which usually increases the melting point. Since there are complex fused ring systems present, we might estimate an increase of about +10°C for their combined structural rigidification effect.
- Methyl groups: Two are present, but their effect on the melting point is usually smaller compared to other groups. They can increase the melting point by around +2°C each due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.

A carboxamide group typically adds around 80 degrees Celsius due to its potential for hydrogen bonding and planarity, which facilitates solid-state packing. 2) The molecule also contains an isoindoline structure, which introduces strain and rigidity to the system, impacting the crystal packing efficiency.

The presence of a bromine atom typically increases melting points due to its significant size and the resulting increase in London dispersion forces; this could add approximately +40 to the melting point. A methoxy group usually introduces an increase in melting point by enhancing intermolecular forces through dipole interactions, we can estimate this to be around +15. The ketone functionality can raise the melting point because of its polarity and any possible hydrogen bonding with nearby molecules, adding +30. The bicyclic structure contributes to melting point elevation due to increased molecular rigidity, estimated at +20. However, the specific orientation of groups and possible strain in the bicyclic system may alter these effects. Thus, an adjustment should be made to account for these interactions and the overall molecular symmetry.

- Benzodioxole moiety: This group is rigid and contributes to the overall planarity and pi-stacking possibilities of the molecule, likely increasing the melting point by approximately 5°C.
- Methylidene linkage to the triazole: This connection to the heterocyle introduces additional rigidity, possibly increasing the melting point by around 5°C.
- Aminotriazole moiety: Triazoles typically have high melting points due to nitrogen's ability to engage in hydrogen bonding and the ring's aromatic nature. Therefore, it might contribute to an additional 10°C.
- Piperidinylmethyl group: The attached piperidine ring adds bulk and may disrupt packing to a degree; however, the effect is probably small due to the flexibility of the six-membered ring. So, let's say it might decrease the melting point slightly, by about 2°C.
- Trifluoromethyl group: The CF3 group is highly electronegative, creating a polar effect and possibly increasing melting point due to its inductive effect, by around 5°C due to enhanced intermolecular forces.

Model.; 2005; 45(3); 581-2916,"To predict the melting point of the given compound, the effects of various structural features and functional groups must be considered quantitatively. Here are the pertinent considerations for this compound: 

- Cyclopentane base structure: As a starting point, we assume a base melting point near room temperature, since simple cycloalkanes have low melting points that are often below room temperature, but highly substituted ones can have higher values. For our estimation, we'll consider the base melting point of cyclopentane to be about 5 degrees Celsius, acknowledging that the extensive substitution in the given compound will vastly elevate this starting point.

- Methyl groups: The presence of seven methyl groups in the molecule will increase the melting point. Methyl groups are alkyl substituents that can increase the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and Van der Waals interactions. We approximate the increase from each methyl group to be around +5 degrees Celsius. Thus, the seven methyl groups will contribute approximately a total of +35 degrees Celsius.

- Carbonyl groups: The two carbonyl groups are likely to result in significant increases to melting point due to the capability of carbonyl to participate in dipole-dipole interactions as well as potential hydrogen bonding with other molecules. Carbonyl groups tend to increase a compound's melting point by around +40 degrees Celsius each due to these factors. Therefore, the two carbonyl groups present would add about +80 degrees Celsius to the melting point.

- Ester functional group: The ester group is polar and capable of dipole-dipole interactions, which can lead to an increase in the melting point. We can conservatively estimate this increase to be about +25 degrees Celsius.

- Bicyclic structure: The bicyclic nature of the compound adds to the molecular rigidity, which typically leads to a higher melting point. We will approximate an additional increase of +10 degrees Celsius for this structural feature. 

Adding all contributions from the different functional groups together, we predict an elevation of the melting point by a cumulative effect of the individual increases, calculated as follows: 

Base cyclopentane structure: +5
Methyl groups: 7 x 5 = +35
Carbonyl groups: 2 x 40 = +80
Ester group: +25
Bicyclic structure: +10

Cholestane has reported melting point of around 80-100 degrees Celsius. The introduction of functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH) and ketone (=O) groups generally increases the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds which require additional energy to break.

For each hydroxyl group, the increase in melting point could be estimated at around +20 due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. With three hydroxyl groups present, this would contribute to an increase of approximately +60.

The ketone groups, with one at C3 and one at C20, can also form hydrogen bonds and may contribute similarly to the melting point. Since these groups are conjugated with the steroid framework, they would individually contribute less than a free hydroxyl group. We can estimate an increase of around +15 for each ketone group, accumulating to +30.

Adding these increments to the estimated base value of cholestane, the prediction for the melting point of hydrocortisone would be:
Base value (cholestane): 90 (average of the range)
Hydroxyl groups: +60 (3 groups)
Ketone groups: +30 (2 groups)
Predominant steroidal structure and molecular complexity would further affect the melting point, potentially adding another +40 due to increased molecular rigidity and intermolecular interactions.

- Base structure without substituted groups (Chromanol), expected to have a moderate melting point as a base value.
- Methyl groups generally increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and slight increase in Van der Waals forces. However, excessive branching from methyl groups can lead to lesser packing efficiency, which could reduce the melting point. Let's estimate a +5 to +10 degrees C for each group.
- The large alkyl chain present increases the molecular weight significantly which also contributes to increased Van der Waals forces, further raising the melting point. Let's estimate a +20 to +25 degrees C.
- Presence of the hydroxyl (-OH) group typically increases melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which is a strong intermolecular force. An increase of about +30 to +50 degrees C might be expected.

However, considering the actual value is very low, the presence of bulky substituents and the complex molecular structure seem to reduce the overall packing efficiency significantly, which greatly lowers the melting point.

The amide groups are capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding which significantly enhances the melting point; for instance, considering acetamide as a reference, with a melting point of 82°C, each amide could be estimated to add a significant amount to the melting point. Similarly, hydrazones contribute to an increase in melting point due to hydrogen bonding and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions. While they do not have oxygen, the nitrogen can still participate in hydrogen bonding, and thus the effect might be slightly less than that of an amide.

The basic benzene unit usually confers a moderate melting point, but the additional functional groups present in this compound can significantly alter this property. Each nitro group contributes to an increase in melting point due to their ability to form strong intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding. The effect of two nitro groups is expected to raise the melting point substantially by approximately 40°C per group. The azohydrazone group (NN=C), due to its contribution to the rigidity of the molecule and the presence of nitrogen atoms capable of engaging in hydrogen bonding, may increase the melting point by about 40-50°C. The alkyl groups attached to the cyclopentene ring contribute a smaller increase in the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces; for the two methyl groups together, this increase could be around 10°C.

The influences on the melting point need to be carefully considered, and the high impact of nitro groups and the azohydrazone group are particularly notable. Given that the compound's rigid and bulky structure with strong intermolecular forces is expected to result in a higher melting point, the predicted value should closely reflect this. Therefore, an approximation based on the additions of each functional group's contribution is given below, using a conservative estimate for the increase provided by the nitro and azohydrazone groups:

Given that biphenyl has a melting point of approximately 69°C, and we have 3 biphenyl units, the effect of each may be additive. Each biphenyl unit may introduce roughly +30 to the base value because of the aforementioned π-π interactions, multiplied by three biphenyl structures equals +90.
 2. The ethanimidamide backbone could introduce additional hydrogen bonding capability, leading to a further increase in melting point. The effect of this moiety might add +20 due to its potential for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

We'll assume a baseline value close to related compounds like phthalimide which has a melting point around 230-233°C.

Considering other tetrachloro compounds as reference, which might add around +20°C per chlorine, we have four chlorines, so approximately +80°C.
- Hydroxy groups: These would normally raise the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. A single hydroxy group could raise the melting point by approximately +5 to +10°C. With two hydroxy groups, it could be around +10 to +20°C.
- Furyl group: This aromatic ring contributes to an increase in molecular complexity and the potential for π-π interactions, which would increase the melting point. It's harder to quantify, but perhaps adding around +5°C.
- Propyl side chain: A longer alkyl chain can increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals interaction, but given the complexity of the compound, its impact might be minor. I estimate around a +1 to +2°C increase.

- Methyl and isopropyl groups being alkyl side chains tend to lower the melting point due to increase in molecular weight and bulk, which hinders close packing, but as the substance is already a liquid at standard conditions, their impact is subdued in this case. 
- Overall, while the rigidity of the bicyclic structure could suggest an increase, the presence of alkyl groups that generally lower melting points and the already low melting point of beta-pinene suggest the changes among these factors might cancel each other out to some degree.",-61.0,-61.0,0.0

- Alkene group (C=C): The presence of a double bond can have a modest impact on the melting point due to the shape and rigidity it imparts to the molecule. However, its effect is less pronounced than that of a nitrile group, so we might estimate an increase of about 5 °C.

1. Benzodioxan ring system: This system includes a benzene ring fused with a 1,4-dioxane ring. The introduction of this system to the biphenyl structure results in the possibility of additional intermolecular interactions due to the two oxygen atoms, which are capable of hydrogen bonding. These interactions should notably increase the melting point.

The basic structure can be considered as a hydrazone modified with aromatic and bicyclic components. Here's the breakdown: 

- Benzene ring: Common starting reference due to its stability and commonality. It has a melting point of 5.53°C. As the compound contains two benzene rings, this creates a baseline for aromaticity which tends to raise melting point due to π-π stacking interactions and increased rigidity of the molecule. 

- Nitro groups: Each nitro group significantly raises the melting point due to strong intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding with neighboring molecules. A single nitro group on a benzene ring can raise the melting point by approximately 80°C. With two nitro groups, this effect is doubled. 

- Hydrazone linkage (NN=C): The presence of a hydrazone linkage contributes to the rigidity of the molecule and can also form hydrogen bonds, although its contribution to the melting point is less pronounced than nitro groups. This might add around 20 to 30°C to the melting point. 

- Bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1,3,5-triene structure: This bicyclic structure increases the rigidity of the molecule and raises the melting point due to more organized molecular packing. The effect can be estimated at around 40°C when compared to similar compounds with acyclic or less rigid structures. 

- Methyl group: A small alkyl group like a methyl group will have a minor effect on the melting point, as it increases the molecular weight and size slightly. It might contribute around 5°C. 

Considering these effects cumulatively, we get a predicted melting point as follows:

- Baseline benzene: 5.53°C

In this complex molecule, the electron-withdrawing effect is counterbalanced by possible intermolecular interactions, preventing a significant decrease in melting point, so we'll estimate -2°C for each nitro group, for a total of -4°C for the two present.

The base structure will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5°C. The presence of functional groups and structural complexity in the target molecule will modify this base value. The functional groups include a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a methyl group, and an isopropyl configuration. For each group, we can estimate its contribution to the melting point as follows:

- Benzene ring: 5.5°C (base value)
- Hydroxyl group (OH): Est. +40 to 50°C (strong hydrogen bonding capability)
- Methylamino group (NHCH3): Est. +30 to 40°C (partial hydrogen bonding but steric hindrance might reduce this effect)
- Isopropyl group: Est. +10 to 20°C (increased molecular weight and steric hindrance)

However, the actual melting point is 36.0°C, which is considerably lower than the sum of the estimated contributions of each group. This discrepancy suggests that the estimated values for each functional group effect are too high, or there could be destabilizing interactions within the molecule or a less stable crystal lattice. Still, the contributions of the functional groups must add up to the actual melting point, so we need to adjust our estimates. Considering a more prudent estimate for each group:

- Hydroxyl group (OH): +15°C (decreased estimate due to potential destabilizing interactions)
- Methylamino group (NHCH3): +10°C (reduced estimate considering weaker hydrogen bonding due to steric hindrance)
- Methyl group (CH3) and Isopropyl group: +5°C (combined, less contribution due to compact structure reducing van der Waals forces)

Firstly, the indole group is a fused ring system which allows for greater van der Waals interactions and results in a higher melting point, estimated effect is around +100°C. Secondly, the carboxylic acid group typically increases the melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds; this can add another +100°C. The ketone group, placed on the second position of the indole, contributes to stability via conjugation and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated an additional +15°C. Lastly, there is the impact of molecular weight and rigidity from the cyclic structure, adding approximately another +10°C. Combining these effects will give us the predicted melting point.",238.0,230.0,8.0

The thiazole ring is expected to raise the melting point significantly, adding around 40°C due to its heterocyclic character providing additional intermolecular interaction potential.
- Nitrile groups are known to increase the melting point, estimated here as 20°C, as they can engage in hydrogen bonding as acceptors and influence the molecule's polarity and hence its intermolecular forces. 
- The propene linkage may slightly affect the melting point with an increase of about 5°C, accounting for the larger molecular size and potential for π-π interactions. 
- The dimethylamino group might enhance the melting point by 15°C, considering both the added molecular weight and the ability for additional intermolecular interactions involving nitrogen.

- Benzene rings: These are aromatic rings that have high symmetry and provide strong intermolecular forces due to $\\-\$\rho$ interactions. Standard benzene has a melting point around 5.5 °C.

- Amide group: Amide groups can form hydrogen bonds and generally increase the melting point significantly. An amide group is estimated to increase the melting point by about 80-100 °C.

- Alkene group: Alkenes tend to have lower melting points than alkanes due to less efficient packing, but in conjugation with aromatic rings as in this compound, they may not reduce the melting point significantly. The alkene group is thus considered neutral here.

- Benzothiazole group: This system, like benzene, also has aromatic character and contributes to an increase in melting point due to its heteroaromatic nature. It can be estimated to raise the melting point by about 40-50 °C.

- Dimethylamino group: This group can engage in dipole-dipole interactions but is not as influential as the amide. It can increase the melting point by approximately 20-30 °C.
