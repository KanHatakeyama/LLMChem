        "Reason": "The basic unit for considering the melting point would be butane, which has a melting point of -138.4. Adding phenyl groups tends to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight, van der Waals forces, and potential for pi-pi interactions. Each phenyl group could be estimated to increase the melting point significantly. For 1,1-diphenylbutane, we have two phenyl groups attached to the same carbon atom, which could increase the melting point by +60 each (due to the reasons mentioned above and considering the bulky nature of each phenyl group that hinders close packing), for a total increase of +120. However, the presence of two phenyl groups on the same carbon might also result in steric hindrance that could disrupt optimal packing, slightly lowering the expected increment value. Let's postulate an increase of +110 for both phenyl groups together. This leads to a predicted melting point of -138.4 (butane) + 110 (increased melting point due to phenyl groups) = -28.4.",
