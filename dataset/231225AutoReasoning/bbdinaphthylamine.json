        "Reason": "The target compound, b,b'-dinaphthylamine, is based on naphthalene which has a melting point of 80.2 degrees Celsius. The presence of two naphthalene groups will significantly enhance the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the planar structure that allows for better stacking and stronger intermolecular pi-pi interactions: +90 (two rings; +45 each). The presence of the -NH- group connecting the two rings provides an additional site for hydrogen bonding, which will further increase the melting point: +2. The amine group can establish intermolecular hydrogen bonds which can raise the melting point; however, in this molecule, the nitrogen is part of an aromatic system and may not be as free to form hydrogen bonds as in aliphatic amines: +0. Therefore, in comparison to naphthalene, the overall increase is expected to be quite high due to the greater degree of interactions afforded by the additional aromatic rings and the bridging amine group.",
