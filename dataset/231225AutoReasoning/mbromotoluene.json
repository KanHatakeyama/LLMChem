        "Reason": "The base structure here is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The methyl group in toluene generally raises the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and branching. However, the bromine in m-bromotoluene is a large substituent that will significantly increase the molecular weight but may also disrupt the crystalline packing, leading to a less predictable effect. Historically, halogens like bromine when attached to an aromatic ring tend to lower the melting point due to their large size and polarizability, which can impede tight molecular packing necessary for a high melting point. Bromine is expected to lower the melting point by around -45\u00b0C.",
