        "Reason": "The compound 3-fluoro-4-methylaniline consists of an aniline base unit, a methyl group, and a fluorine atom as substituents on a benzene ring. Aniline has a melting point of about -6 degrees Celsius. The methyl group is an electron-donating group which generally increases the melting point due to a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces; it could contribute an estimated +5 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atom is an electron-withdrawing group that not only increases molecular weight slightly but also strengthens the dipole-dipole interactions due to its electronegativity, which likely contributes more significantly to the increase in melting point; it could contribute an estimated +30 degrees Celsius. The combined effects of the functional groups give us the predicted melting point.",
