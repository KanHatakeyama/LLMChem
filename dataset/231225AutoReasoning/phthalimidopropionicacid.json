        "Reason": "The basic structure here is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups in the phthalimide will considerably increase the melting point due to their ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonds with surrounding molecules. Each carbonyl might be estimated to increase the melting point by around 40-50\u00b0C. The propionic acid side chain adds another carbonyl, which could add another 30-40\u00b0C, as well as a terminal carboxylic acid which can engage in strong hydrogen bonding, possibly contributing an additional 40-50\u00b0C to the melting point. However, the added propyl group would normally add some flexibility to the molecule and slightly lower the melting point, but the effect might be minimal compared to the strong intermolecular forces from the other functional groups.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The phthalimide structure includes two carbonyl groups which increases the melting point significantly, each contributing approximately 40-50\u00b0C due to their strong dipole-dipole interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding. The propionic acid side chain adds another carbonyl, which can be estimated to increase the melting point by an additional 30-40\u00b0C, and the terminal carboxylic acid is able to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, contributing another 40-50\u00b0C. Though the propyl group normally might reduce the melting point due to increased flexibility, its effect is likely negligible in the face of the strong intermolecular forces provided by the functional groups. The overall increase in melting point is therefore the sum of the increments provided by the functional groups.",
