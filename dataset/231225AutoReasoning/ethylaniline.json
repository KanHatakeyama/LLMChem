        "Reason": "The basic unit, aniline, has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. Adding an ethyl group to the para-position of the aniline aromatic ring generally increases the melting point due to increasing the molecular weight and providing a minor increase in symmetry, but the increase is not significant since the ethyl group also introduces some flexibility which can reduce the efficiency of crystal packing. Given that the ethyl group is larger than a methyl group, which typically would add about +3 to +5 degrees Celsius to the melting point, an ethyl group might add slightly more, around +5 to +8 degrees Celsius.",
