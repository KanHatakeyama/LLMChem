        "Reason": "The basic unit here is quinoline which has a melting point around 237\u00b0C. The effect of introducing the N-oxide function lowers this melting point significantly because it introduces an internal dipole that can stabilize the compound in a solid state, but also causes disruptions in the crystal lattice due to the steric and electronic effects. The methylation at the 3-position would tend to raise the melting point slightly as it increases the molecular weight and provides more van der Waals interactions, probably around +5\u00b0C. However, the presence of the N-oxide is a much more significant factor that will lower the melting point substantially, by an estimated -150\u00b0C or more given the polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions it adds, contrasting the stabilizing effects of the methyl group.",
