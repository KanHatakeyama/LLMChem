        "Reason": "Starting with benzene, which has a boiling point of 80\u00b0C, the introduction of various substituents will modify this value. Each isopropyl group, due to its larger molecular weight and volume as compared to a hydrogen atom, will increase the melting point. This increase can be approximated to around +20\u00b0C per isopropyl group. However, the presence of the carbonyl chloride (COCl) functional group will lead to a further increase attributed to the polarized covalent bond and possible intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole attractions, which we can approximate at a +50\u00b0C increase. Hence, the melting point shifts could be approximated as follows: Base benzene: 80\u00b0C 3 isopropyl groups: 3 * 20\u00b0C = +60\u00b0C Carbonyl chloride group: +50\u00b0C Total predicted increase: 60 + 50 = +110\u00b0C",

        "Reason": "Starting from benzene as the basic unit with a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, modification by functional groups will alter this value. Each isopropyl group, due to its branched structure, increases steric hindrance and promotes stronger van der Waals interactions, thereby raising the melting point. The estimated increase is approximately +15\u00b0C for each isopropyl group. The benzoyl chloride functional group adds a withdrawing acyl chloride moiety which can increase the melting point due to polar interactions and the possibility of hydrogen bonding with moisture, for which an increase of +40\u00b0C can be estimated. Therefore, the total shift is calculated as: Base benzene: 5.5\u00b0C 3 isopropyl groups: 3 * 15\u00b0C = +45\u00b0C Benzoyl chloride group: +40\u00b0C Total predicted increase: 5.5 + 45 + 40 = +90.5\u00b0C",

        "Reason": "The target compound is 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzoyl chloride. The basic unit for comparison is benzoyl chloride, which has a melting point of 12.7\u00b0C. The isopropyl group is known for increasing melting points due to its larger size and branching when it's attached to a benzene ring. Each isopropyl group, consisting of bulky branched alkyl chains, can increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C due to added steric hindrance and increased molecular weight. There are three such groups, so we can approximate the increase as 3 * 20\u00b0C = 60\u00b0C. Also, the carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the benzene ring increases the melting point due to its polar nature and possible intermolecular hydrogen bonding with any nearby molecules, contributing approximately 5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom attached also increases the melting point because of its electronegativity and the polar bond it forms with the adjacent carbonyl carbon, this can contribute around 5\u00b0C. Adding these effects gives us an estimated melting point of 12.7\u00b0C (base) + 60\u00b0C (isopropyl groups) + 5\u00b0C (carbonyl group) + 5\u00b0C (chlorine) = 82.7\u00b0C.",
