        "Reason": "The basic unit for methylvinylether is ethylene (C=C) which has a melting point of -169\u00b0C. The oxygen in the ether functional group typically raises the melting point due to its ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions, but here it has a small impact because it's connected to the vinyl group which has double bond character and restricts the rotation around the bond, thus limiting the strength of these interactions. Ether group: +20\u00b0C. A methyl group adds steric bulk and mass, which tends to slightly raise the melting point. Methyl group: +27\u00b0C.",
