        "Reason": "The basic unit, indole, has a melting point around 52. When substituting an amino group at the para position to the NH of the indole, its effect on the melting point must be considered. The amino group generally increases the melting point due to its potential for hydrogen bonding, which increases the stability of the solid phase. Considering an increase of approximately +40 for the introduction of the amino group to such a heteroaromatic compound.",

The amino group generally increases the melting point due to its potential for hydrogen bonding, which increases the stability of the solid phase. However, the predicted increase provided in the Reason is insufficient. Taking into account the substantial hydrogen-bonding ability of the amino group, the increase should be reconsidered. A more accurate estimate for an amino group's contribution to the melting point of an aromatic heterocycle like indole might be around +56. This adjustment would reflect the stronger intermolecular forces and increased molecular rigidity provided by the amino group at such a position.",
