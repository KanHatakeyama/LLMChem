        "Reason": "The target compound is phthalamic acid. The basic structure, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The two carboxyl groups each would typically increase the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and their contribution to the overall molecular weight. Given that two carboxyl groups are present, we can estimate an increase of approximately +70\u00b0C for each (as seen in similar molecules like benzoic acid). Also, the addition of an amide group tends to raise the melting point further due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the molecule's rigidity. The amide group could be expected to add about +40\u00b0C. However, as the carboxyl and amide groups are attached to the same ring, this might slightly reduce the overall effect due to steric hindrance, so the total increment might be less than the sum of each individual group's effect.",

        "Reason": "The target molecule, phthalamic acid, is based on a benzene ring. The standard melting point for benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. Two functional groups are present in phthalamic acid that significantly influence its melting point: the carboxyl group (-COOH) and the amide group (-CONH2). Typically, each carboxyl group can increase the melting point by about +50\u00b0C to +70\u00b0C due to the ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds that require more energy (heat) to break. However, since there are two carboxyl groups, and they can potentially interact with each other, the combined effect may not be exactly additive but rather slightly lower. Therefore, we'll assume a +100\u00b0C increment for both carboxyl groups. The amide group also substantially elevates the melting point, generally contributing around +40\u00b0C to +80\u00b0C based on hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization that restricts rotation around the amide bond, increasing the rigidity of the molecule. Therefore, we predict the amide group will raise the melting point by +60\u00b0C. Considering both adjustments for the carboxyl groups and the amide group, we correct for potential steric hindrance which might slightly reduce the added increments by an estimated -10\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basic structure to consider is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of two carbonyl groups (one as an amide and one as a carboxylic acid) increases the melting point significantly due to the potential for both intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Each carbonyl group would add approximately +80 degrees Celsius. However, these effects are somewhat mitigated by the steric hindrance and the electron-donating effect of the amide nitrogen, which slightly reduces the overall dipole moment. This could reduce the predicted increase by around -10 degrees Celsius for the amide group. The carboxylic acid group also enables strong hydrogen bonding, which adds to the melting point significantly. Consequently, the overall predicted shift should consider these effects.",

Each carboxylic acid group typically can raise the melting point by providing strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and the electron-withdrawing nature of these groups increases molecular stability and polarity, which could contribute an additional +60 to +70 per group to the melting point. The amide group is capable of forming hydrogen bonds as well and could add +50 to the melting point. However, while adding these increments linearly, there may be cooperative or competitive effects between the functional groups, which could offset the combined increments.
