        "Reason": "The basic unit for this structure is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of around 6.5\u00b0C. However, we have several groups to consider that will modify this value: \n- The two fused rings of the bornane backbone in the camphor structure contribute to increased rigidity and molecular complexity, which typically raises the melting point, estimated effect: +75\u00b0C.\n- The ketone group (C=O) introduces intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, which can also increase the melting point, estimated effect: +25\u00b0C.\n- The sulfonyl chloride group (SO2Cl) is quite electronegative and polar, which can significantly increase the melting point through strong intermolecular attractions, similar to how sulfonamide groups increase the melting point, estimated effect: +50\u00b0C.\n- The chirality of the compound may lead to more orderly packing in the crystal lattice contributing a slight increase, estimated effect: +5\u00b0C.\n- The methyl group adds minimal steric bulk and has a minor influence, estimated effect: +5\u00b0C.",

The two fused rings of the bornane backbone in the camphor structure significantly enhance the rigidity and molecular complexity, which typically results in a substantial increase in the melting point, estimated effect: +20\u00b0C. The ketone group contributes to intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions that raise the melting point due to the polar nature of the carbonyl group, estimated effect: +15\u00b0C. The sulfonyl chloride group is polar and capable of strong dipole-dipole and potential hydrogen bonding interactions, which can significantly increase the melting point, comparable to sulfonamide or sulfonyl groups in other compounds, estimated effect: +25\u00b0C. The chirality of the compound can lead to a more organized packing in the crystal lattice, but its effect on the melting point should be marginal, estimated effect: +2\u00b0C. The methyl group has a minor influence on the melting point due to the slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated effect: +2\u00b0C.",
