        "Reason": "The basic structure to consider is the 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring, which is a five-membered heterocyclic compound. Heterocyclic compounds generally have higher melting points due to their ring structures, which offer a high degree of symmetry and can engage in stronger intermolecular interactions. Starting with the 1,3,4-oxadiazole itself, which has different substituents on the market, a reasonable estimation would consider its melting point to be around 100 degrees Celsius due to these features. Each phenyl group contributes to an increase in the melting point because it provides additional pi-pi stacking possibilities, which translates to enhanced intermolecular forces. A single phenyl ring could be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20 degrees Celsius. Given two phenyl rings are attached to the oxadiazole ring, the total increase would be 40 degrees Celsius. Therefore, considering both phenyl groups and the basic oxadiazole ring, the predicted melting point would be 140 degrees Celsius.",
