        "Reason": "The target compound is based on a tetrahydroquinoxaline core, which already has a substantial molecular structure that promotes intermolecular interactions, increasing the melting point. Specific contributions are:\\n- Tetrahydroquinoxaline base: Assumed base value around 100 due to its bicyclic nature and nitrogen atoms that can engage in hydrogen bonding.\\n- Methoxybenzylidene: +10 due to additional aromaticity and possible dipole-dipole interactions afforded by the methoxy group.\\n- Two 4-methylphenylsulfonyl groups: Each group would add around +20 due to increased van der Waals interactions from the bulky sulfonyl and methyl groups, and enhanced rigidity of the molecule.\\nTotal predicted shift: 10 + 2*(20) = +50\\n",
