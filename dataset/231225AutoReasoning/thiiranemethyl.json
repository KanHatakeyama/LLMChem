        "Reason": "The basic unit here is ethylene oxide, which has a melting point of -111.3\u00b0C. Thiirane (ethylene sulfide) would have a similar melting point due to its similar ring strain and size but it is slightly higher due to the presence of the sulfur atom, which is larger and more polarizable than an oxygen atom. The addition of a methyl group generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. We may estimate this increase to be in the range of +15 to +20\u00b0C.",
