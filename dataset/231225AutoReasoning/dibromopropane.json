        "Reason": "The basic unit, propane, has a melting point of -188 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a bromine atom generally raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and Van der Waals forces. Each bromine is expected to contribute significantly. A bromine atom may add around +70 degrees Celsius to the melting point of propane due to its significant size and mass. As we have two bromines, the cumulative effect would be a total of +140 degrees Celsius adjustment to the base melting point.",
