        "Reason": "The basic unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of a carboxylic acid functional group significantly increases melting point due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which I'll estimate as an addition of +140\u00b0C. A tert-butyl group is normally expected to lower the melting point due to increased steric hindrance which interferes with crystal packing; however, this effect is usually less pronounced than the influence of polar functional groups, so I'll estimate this as a -10\u00b0C change.",

The addition of a carboxylic acid functional group significantly increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which I'll estimate as an addition of +140\u00b0C. A tert-butyl group typically lowers the melting point because it interferes with crystal packing, but since the carboxylic acid is a solid-forming group due to its ability to form a dimeric structure through hydrogen bonds, the tert-butyl group's effect might be less significant. For accuracy, considering steric hindrance and bulkiness, a more modest impact of the tert-butyl group should be evaluated, such as -20\u00b0C change.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of around 5.5 \u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group generally increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and dimerization, which could add approximately 100 \u00b0C. The tert-butyl group, being bulky, tends to increase the melting point further by increasing the molecule's symmetry and packing efficiency in the solid state, which could add around 50 \u00b0C. However, bulkiness could also cause steric hindrance which might decrease the efficiency of packing slightly, reducing this effect to about 40 \u00b0C. Therefore, the overall increase is estimated to be around 140 \u00b0C compared to the base structure of benzene.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of around 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group can significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and dimers; this can typically add about 100 \u00b0C to the melting point. The tert-butyl group adds steric bulk to the molecule, which can increase the melting point by improving the crystal packing efficiency in the solid state due to greater van der Waals interactions. While steric hindrance could reduce packing efficiency, the tert-butyl group's symmetrical structure likely offsets this effect. The overall increase due to the tert-butyl group is estimated to be about 55 \u00b0C. Therefore, the cumulative effect of these functional groups is estimated to be an increase of approximately 155 \u00b0C from the base structure of benzene.",
