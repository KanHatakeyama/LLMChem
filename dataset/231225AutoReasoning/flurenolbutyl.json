        "Reason": "The target compound flurenol-butyl is based on a fluorenone backbone with additional functional groups. Fluorenone itself has a melting point of approximately 83\u00b0C. The butyl group typically reduces the melting point slightly because it adds flexiblity, which destabilizes the crystal lattice. The hydroxyl group, being polar, will increase the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding. But since it's attached to the carbonyl, this effect can be reduced by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which does not contribute significantly to crystal lattice stability. The attached butyl group is estimated to reduce the melting point by about -10\u00b0C from the fluorenone base. While the hydroxyl group would tend to increase it by about +5\u00b0C, with the intramolecular bond reducing this effect, we can approximate a net change of about +2\u00b0C. The net effect is a reduction in melting point overall.",
