        "Reason": "The basic aromatic unit for aniline has a melting point of -6 \u00b0C. When considering the effects of substituents, a chlorine atom, when attached to the phenyl group, increases the melting point due to its electronegativity and the potential for intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. However, the presence of the amino group (NH2) attached directly to the phenyl ring tends to lower the melting point because of the hindrance created by its non-planar sp3 hybridized nitrogen, which can disrupt the crystal lattice. The dominant effect in 2-chloroaniline is the chloro substituent which is ortho to the amino group, enhancing the intermolecular interactions due to its electronegativity and proximity to the NH2 group. Chloro group: +3 \u00b0C (estimated increment for electronegativity and dipole-dipole interaction), Amino group: 0 \u00b0C (no additional effect considered for the amino group, since it also is present in aniline).",
