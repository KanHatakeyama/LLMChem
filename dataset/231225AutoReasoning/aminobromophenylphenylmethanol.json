Amino group: Likely to increase the melting point due to capability for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +30\u00b0C. Phenyl group: Adds structural rigidity and potential pi-pi stacking interactions, which can moderately raise the melting point, estimated at +15\u00b0C. Hydroxymethyl group: The presence of hydroxyl group can lead to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, estimated to add +25\u00b0C to the melting point.

        "Reason": "The molecular structure of (2-amino-4-bromophenyl)(phenyl)methanol can be separated into three parts for estimation: the basic phenyl ring, a bromine substituent, and an amino and hydroxyl substituent. Let's start with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of substituents generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and increased van der Waals forces.\n\n- Bromine is a large halogen with significant mass which can raise the melting point significantly compared to a hydrogen atom. The impact of Br on the melting point could be estimated to increase it by about 20\u00b0C.\n\n- An amino group (-NH2) can participate in hydrogen bonding which can raise the melting point due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The presence of an amino group could increase the melting point by about 40\u00b0C.\n\n- A hydroxyl group (-OH) also is capable of hydrogen bonding, and similar to the amino group, it can raise the melting point. An increase of about 30\u00b0C can be attributed to this group.\n\n- The additional phenyl ring adds to the molecular weight and symmetry of the structure, which can further increase the melting point. This could add an estimated 10\u00b0C increase.\n\nAdding these together gives the total estimated increase in melting point.",
