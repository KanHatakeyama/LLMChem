        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of isoxaben, we'll quantitatively consider the effects of each functional group. The basic structure can be viewed as a modified benzene ring. The primary modifications include the presence of an isoxazole ring, a tertiary butyl group, and an N-phenylcarbamate moiety with two methoxy groups on the phenyl ring. Benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The isoxazole ring contains nitrogen, which can introduce intermolecular hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point significantly. The tertiary butyl group increases molecular weight and provides steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point moderately. The N-phenylcarbamate group will also raise the melting point because it results in a higher molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding. Each methoxy group contributes to increased molecular weight and polarity, leading to higher melting points. While it's challenging to assign exact values without empirical data, we can infer the following estimated increases: isoxazole ring: +100 (strong effect from hydrogen bonding and nitrogen's electronegativity), tertiary butyl group: +20 (steric effects and increased molecular weight), N-phenylcarbamate: +30 (increased molecular weight, rigidity, and hydrogen bonding), methoxy groups: +10 each (polarity and weight).",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (benzene) + 100 (isoxazole ring) + 20 (tertiary butyl group) + 30 (N-phenylcarbamate) + 10 (first methoxy) + 10 (second methoxy) = 175.5\u00b0C",
        "Prediction(integer)": 176.0
