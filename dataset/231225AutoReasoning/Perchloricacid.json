        "Reason": "The basic unit here can be considered as water (H2O), which has a melting point of 0 degrees Celsius. Perchloric acid (HClO4) has a much higher oxidizing power and the additional oxygens increase intermolecular hydrogen bonding substantially, as well as the molecular weight. Each additional oxygen atom could potentially increase the melting point. Notably, the presence of the highly electronegative chlorine atom bonded to oxygen provides a strong dipole moment, which further increases intermolecular forces, thus increasing the melting point. However, the actual value is lower than expected, which could be due to the ability of the molecule to form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules from the environment (hygroscopic behavior), leading to depression of the melting point. Therefore, the additional oxygens and chlorine would seem to increase the melting point, but hygroscopic nature and perhaps the molecular geometry leading to less efficient packing could lower it. The combined effect gives a melting point lower than water.",
