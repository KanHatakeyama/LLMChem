        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of ethyl 4-bromophenylacetate, we must consider the effects of each functional group relative to a base structure. Starting with benzene as the simplest aromatic structure, we know it has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Then, we need to consider the following adjustments: Phenyl group (as part of phenylacetate structure) is a large planar structure that can enhance stacking and thus increase the melting point. Esters (like the ethyl ester in ethyl 4-bromophenylacetate) usually have lower melting points due to their ability to rotate, which counters the rigidity of the planar phenyl group. Bromine is a large, polarizable substituent; its presence can facilitate intermolecular interactions like dipole-dipole and London dispersion forces, thereby increasing the melting point. We have to accumulate these effects to predict the shift in melting point: Phenyl group: +35\u00b0C (due to increased planarity and stacking ability) Ethyl ester: -15\u00b0C (introduces flexibility and lowers the melting point) Bromine: +5\u00b0C (increases intermolecular forces due to its size and polarizability).",
