        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-propanone (acetone) has a melting point of -94.7. Bromo groups generally raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, as well as potential for dipole-dipole interactions. For each bromo group attached to a molecule similar to acetone, we can estimate an increase in melting point by roughly 60 (taking a typical average for halogen substitutions on small organic molecules). Thus, adding two bromo groups would increase the melting point significantly. 2-propanone, 1,3-dibromo- also retains the carbonyl group, which has the ability to form hydrogen bonds with surrounding molecules, further increasing the melting point, estimated to add around 20 to the melting point.",

        "Reason": "The compound 2-propanone, 1,3-dibromo- has multiple functional groups influencing its melting point. The base molecule is 2-propanone (acetone), which has a melting point of -94.7\u00b0C. Bromine substituents generally increase the melting point due to the higher molecular weight and increased van der Waals forces. One bromine might add approximately +60\u00b0C to the melting point of acetone. However, since there are two bromines, the combined effect would be expected to be somewhat less than simply doubling this impact due to potential steric hindrance. The carbonyl group itself is polar and contributes to a higher melting point due to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions compared to hydrocarbons of similar molecular weight. A reasonable estimation for the contribution of a carbonyl could be +20\u00b0C for melting point consideration.",
