        "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. - Alkoxy group (OC): +40 due to the polarity and possible hydrogen bonding interactions it can facilitate. - Methyl group (CH3): +20 because of the increase in van der Waals forces due to larger molecular size. - Nitro group (NO2): -10 because of intermolecular attractions and dipoles which lower the melting point as it introduces steric hindrance. These functional groups influence the melting point differently, leading to a cumulative effect of their individual contributions.",
