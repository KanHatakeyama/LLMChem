        "Reason": "The compound ranimustine has several functional groups that affect its melting point. The basic structure for comparison is the glucopyranose unit, which in its monomeric form (glucose) has a melting point of 146\u00b0C. The various functional groups attached to this glucopyranose unit in ranimustine will modify this value. The hydroxyl groups (-OH) generally increase hydrogen bonding, which would increase the melting point, but since they are already accounted for in the glucose reference value, we don\u2019t assign additional increase for them. However, the methylnitrosourea side chain introduces several effects. The carbonyl group (C=O) contributes to potential polar interactions and dipole-dipole attractions. Nitrosourea can introduce a slight increase due to the polar characteristic of the nitroso group (N=O) and the urea functionality. The chlorine substituent (CCl) adds to the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but it could also disrupt the crystal packing due to its larger size, potentially both slightly increasing and decreasing the melting point. In aggregate, these effects are likely to reduce the melting point somewhat from that of glucose. Taking these functional groups into account, a decrease of about 35\u00b0C from the reference value can be estimated: methylnitrosourea side chain as a whole (including the urea and nitroso functionalities) can be estimated to decrease the melting point by 30\u00b0C, and the chlorine substituent may additionally decrease it by 5\u00b0C due to steric hindrance despite its increase in molecular weight.",
