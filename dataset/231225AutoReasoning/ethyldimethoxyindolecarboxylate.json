        "Reason": "Base compound, indole has a melting point of around 52\u00b0C. Considering the functional groups, - Ethyl ester (COOEt) group: +40\u00b0C, due to increased molecular weight and polarity. - Methoxy groups (2x OCH3): +2x30\u00b0C, as they increase polarity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. - Direct attachment of substituents to the aromatic ring typically raises the melting point due to more rigid structure.",
