        "Reason": "The basic unit for xanthene can be thought of as naphthalene, with an extra oxygen atom in a ring-forming structure. Naphthalene has a melting point of 80.2 degrees Celsius. The addition of the oxygen atom introduces polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which generally would increase the melting point due to the increased intermolecular forces. However, it is also in a ring, leading to potential ring strain which might lower the melting point somewhat. Given the effects, the additional oxygen might raise the melting point approximately by +20 degrees Celsius.",
