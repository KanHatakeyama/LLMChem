        "Reason": "Breaking down the functional groups for 3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and considering their effect on the melting point: \n- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5. \n- Hydroxy group (\u2013OH): +100 (provides strong hydrogen bonding). \n- Aldehyde group (\u2013CHO): +20 (polar carbonyl group increases melting point). \n- di-tert-butyl groups: -30 each (bulky groups that make the molecule more asymmetrical and hinder close packing in the solid state, generally decreasing melting point). \n\nWhen considering these effects together, the hydroxy group raises the melting point significantly due to hydrogen bonding, while the bulky di-tert-butyl groups lower it. The aldehyde group's overall effect increases the melting point, but less dramatically than the hydroxy group. \n\nCalculation: \n5.5 (benzene) + 100 (\u2013OH) + 20 (\u2013CHO) - 30 (first tert-butyl) - 30 (second tert-butyl) = 65.5",
