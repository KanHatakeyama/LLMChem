        "Reason": "Thymidine's basic structure can be considered as a combination of a pyrimidine ring and a deoxyribose sugar. The pyrimidine ring is similar to the base compound pyrimidine, which melts at 20-22\u00b0C. The deoxyribose sugar moiety is similar to the sugar ribose, which has a melting point of 86\u00b0C. The combination of these two functional groups will increase the total melting point. However, in thymidine, the formation of the nucleoside results in a more complex and rigid structure due to the N-glycosidic bond, which should increase the melting point further. The presence of hydrogen bonding in the hydroxyl groups on the sugar and the carbonyl and amino groups on the base should increase the melting point significantly due to the intramolecular and possible intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Overall, the rigid structure and potential for extensive hydrogen bonding suggest a melting point significantly higher than either pyrimidine or deoxyribose alone. Estimations: pyrimidine core: +100\u00b0C due to aromatic stability and hydrogen bonding capability; glycosidic bond: +50\u00b0C due to the complexity of the molecule and rigidity; deoxyribose moiety: +30\u00b0C due to hydroxyl groups promoting hydrogen bonding.",

        "Reason": "The base molecule pyrimidine has a melting point in the range of 20-22\u00b0C. Thymidine incorporates this pyrimidine ring as part of its structure, contributing to the melting point. The attached deoxyribose sugar is similar in structure to ribose, which has a melting point around 86\u00b0C. The addition of the deoxyribose sugar to the pyrimidine core will contribute an increase to the melting point due to its five-membered ring structure and the presence of hydroxyl groups enabling hydrogen bonding. The N-glycosidic bond formation between the sugar and the base in thymidine introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding sites, further elevating the melting point. Quantitatively, the estimated incremental increases to the melting point due to the combination of functional groups are: pyrimidine core: +100\u00b0C from the base value because of aromatic stability and capacity for hydrogen bonding; glycosidic bond: +50\u00b0C for the increase in molecular complexity and rigidity; deoxyribose sugar moiety: +18\u00b0C for the hydroxyl groups' contribution through hydrogen bonding. This results in a cumulative predicted increase of 168\u00b0C over the base value of pyrimidine.",
