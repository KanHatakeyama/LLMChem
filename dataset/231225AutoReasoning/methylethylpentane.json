        "Reason": "The base structure of pentane has a melting point of around -130\u00b0C. Adding methyl and ethyl groups can both increase and decrease the melting point depending on their position in the molecule. In the case of 2-methyl-3-ethylpentane: - 2-Methyl substitution: +5 because while branching typically raises the boiling point by creating a more compact structure, it may lower the melting point by disrupting crystal packing efficiency. - 3-Ethyl substitution: -3 due to similar reasons as the methyl group; it increases steric hindrance, but also less efficiently packed structure reduces the melting point slightly. The combined effect of both groups slightly raises the melting point because both substituents introduce steric hindrance that limits efficient packing.",

However, in this case, the additional branching increases the surface area slightly, which could lead to a small increase in the melting point. \n- 3-Ethyl substitution: +10\u00b0C due to larger size than the methyl group, which increases the molecular weight and surface area more substantially, leading to a higher shift in the melting point. \nConsidering the combined effects of steric hindrance and the increase in surface area and molecular weight from both substituents, the melting point is raised by the sum of the individual contributions.",
