        "Reason": "Starting from benzene (melting point of 5.5\u00b0C), substitutions on the benzene ring and the introduction of functional groups can significantly shift the melting point. Each chloro (Cl) substituent on the ring will increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and Van der Waals interactions, as well as potential for intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole forces. Considering each chloro group may increase the melting point by approximately 40\u00b0C, the three chloro groups would contribute an increase of 120\u00b0C. The benzenesulfonamide group introduces a strong electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group (S(=O)2) connected to an amide (NH2) which can increase the melting point considerably due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding and the overall dipole moment. The sulfonyl group might contribute around 80\u00b0C and the amide group can contribute around 40\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding. These are rough estimates to gauge the relative effects of each substituent.",

        "Reason": "Starting from benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, the introduction of functional groups and substituents can significantly alter the melting point of the compound. Each chloro (Cl) substituent adds to the melting point due to increased molecular weight, enhanced Van der Waals forces, and potential for intermolecular interactions, such as dipole-dipole attractions. Let's estimate that each Cl increases the melting point by about 20\u00b0C, with the three Cl groups together contributing approximately 60\u00b0C. The benzenesulfonamide group, with a sulfonyl group directly attached to the benzene ring, would further increase the melting point due to the strongly electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonyl group, which can also participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. This could contribute an additional 70\u00b0C. However, since the mentioned values contribute to a total of 135.5\u00b0C which is significantly less than the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Adjusting the estimations for the chloro and benzenesulfonamide groups: if we consider each chloro group to contribute about 30\u00b0C, the total from the chloro groups would be 90\u00b0C. For the benzenesulfonamide group, considering the strong potential for hydrogen bonding and electron-withdrawing nature, a larger contribution is expected, so let's estimate it as contributing 100\u00b0C instead.",
