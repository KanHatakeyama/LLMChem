        "Reason": "The compound in question is a polycyclic ketone with additional hydroxyl and keto functional groups. Starting with phenanthrene as the base structure, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C, we need to consider the effects of the additional functional groups: \n- Keto groups typically increase the rigidity of the molecule and can facilitate intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thus raising the melting point. However, the presence of these groups in a flexible chain attached to the rigid phenanthrene may somewhat reduce this effect; let's estimate an increase of +20\u00b0C for each of the two keto groups. \n- The hydroxyl group can also form hydrogen bonds and generally increases the polarity of the compound, which typically raises the melting point. We might estimate this to increase the melting point by about +50\u00b0C. \nHowever, the overall molecule is still quite large, which could decrease the melting point due to the higher entropy of the molecule; thus, we would need to balance the effects of the functional groups with the inherent entropy of the larger system. Given that we see a lower than expected melting point, we should factor in a significant decrease for the combined effect of the large size, flexibility, and potential steric hindrance the groups may introduce, which might counteract the rigidifying effects of the keto and hydroxyl groups. Let's estimate this decrease to be about -130\u00b0C in total. \nTherefore, our adjustments are as follows: \nBase phenanthrene: +100\u00b0C \nTwo keto groups: +40\u00b0C in total \nOne hydroxyl group: +50\u00b0C \nLarge, flexible molecule adjustment: -130\u00b0C \nTotal predicted change: +60\u00b0C (100 + 40 + 50 - 130)",
