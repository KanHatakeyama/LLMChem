        "Reason": "As a starting point for predicting the melting point of octyl cyanide, it is valuable to compare it to pentane, which has a melting point of -130. The extended carbon chain in octyl cyanide compared to pentane provides more surface for van der Waals interactions, thus raising the melting point. Each additional CH2 group contributes approximately +5 to the melting point. With pentane's melting point at -130 and the fact that there are three more CH2 groups in octyl cyanide, we calculate the shift due to the carbon chain extension (3 CH2 groups x +5 each = +15). The nitrile (cyanide) group typically raises the melting point due to the relatively strong dipole-dipole interactions compared to an alkane. This group can be estimated to raise the melting point by about +80. Therefore, the overall shift from pentane to octyl cyanide would be the sum of the increases due to the extra CH2 groups and the nitrile group.",
