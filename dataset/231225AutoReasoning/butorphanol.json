        "Reason": "The compound butorphanol is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups that contribute to its melting point. Starting with a simple phenol, which has a melting point at around 41 \u00b0C, we consider the influences of the functional groups and structural complexity in butorphanol. The presence of multiple rings, including a benzene ring and a morphinan skeleton, offers substantial rigidity to the structure and provides a great deal of intermolecular interaction, substantially raising the melting point. The hydroxyl (OH) groups form strong hydrogen bonds, further increasing the melting point. While exact numbers for each functional group's contribution are challenging to assign due to the complexity of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict a significant cumulative shift to a much higher melting point due to these factors.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point for butorphanol is significantly higher than that for simple phenol due to the rigidity and hydrogen bonding capacity of the rings and hydroxyl groups, therefore estimating around a 175\u00b0C increase from the baseline of phenol (41\u00b0C), giving an approximate melting point of 216\u00b0C.",
