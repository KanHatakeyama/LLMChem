        "Reason": "The basic unit, furan, has a melting point of -85.6. An aldehyde group typically raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, however in this case because of the ring strain and the electron distribution in the ring not being conducive to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, the effect might be moderate: let's approximate +20. The conjugation of the aldehyde with the furan ring also contributes to the stabilization of the molecular structure which may slightly increase the melting point: let's approximate +5. Therefore, the total estimated increase from the aldehyde would be +25.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, furan, has a melting point of -85.6 degrees Celsius. Adding an aldehyde group to a molecule typically raises the melting point due to increased possibilities for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions. However, in the case of 2-furaldehyde, the aldehyde is conjugated with the aromatic ring, which may delocalize the electron density and reduce the strength of potential hydrogen bonds. The effect of the aldehyde is present, but it may be less than in other cases. Estimating an increase in melting point of about +47.6 degrees Celsius for the addition of the aldehyde group (considering a moderate enhancement with steric and electronic factors in mind), we obtain a predicted melting point.",
