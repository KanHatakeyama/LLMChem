        "Reason": "The base structure for our target compound is naphthalene, which has a melting point of 80 degrees Celsius. Adding a bromine atom will significantly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and possibly enhance intermolecular interactions like dipole-induced dipole forces, for which we might estimate an increase of +70 degrees. A carboxylic acid group introduces the possibility of hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point substantially due to the strong intermolecular forces. The increase could be estimated at +100 degrees. The vinyl group (\u2013C=C\u2013) will have a minor effect on the melting point compared to the others, we might estimate a small increase of around +20 degrees due to slight increases in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
