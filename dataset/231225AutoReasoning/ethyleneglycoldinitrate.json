        "Reason": "The basic structure to consider for ethylene glycol dinitrate is ethylene glycol, which has two -OH groups that are generally associated with higher melting points due to hydrogen bonding. Ethylene glycol has a melting point of -12.9 degrees Celsius. The nitrate groups in ethylene glycol dinitrate are electron-withdrawing and contribute to an increase in intermolecular forces compared to -OH groups, but unlike -OH, they do not participate in hydrogen bonding. Typically, nitro groups (NO2) have the potential to both increase and decrease the melting point. Their addition to a hydrocarbon chain increases the molecular weight and introduces dipole-dipole interactions, which tend to increase the melting point. However, nitrate groups also introduce steric strain which can decrease the melting point. Since we have two nitrate groups replacing the two -OH groups in ethylene glycol, we expect a decrease in the melting point due to the loss of hydrogen bonding but an increase due to the added molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. These effects partially cancel out, but the loss of hydrogen bonding likely has a slightly larger impact. Therefore, the melting point should decrease overall, but only by a small margin since the dinitrate keeps strong intermolecular forces through its dipole. We estimate the change in melting point per nitrate group to be -5 degrees Celsius, summing to -10 degrees Celsius in total change when both -OH groups are replaced.",
