        "Reason": "The basic unit we can consider is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. When substituents are added to the benzene ring, they can either increase or decrease the melting point depending on their nature and the interactions they induce. In the case of (4-benzyl)chlorobenzene, there are two substituents on different rings to consider: a benzyl group and a chlorine atom. The benzyl group typically would increase the melting point marginally, due to the increase in molecular weight and potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions; let's approximate this increase to be about +3\u00b0C. The chlorine atom is an electronegative substituent and might be expected to increase the melting point as well due to polar interactions; this could be around +2\u00b0C. However, the overall structure is less symmetrical due to the benzyl substituent, which might slightly decrease the melting point, but this effect is expected to be minor compared to the increases.",
