        "Reason": "The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of 41\u00b0C. The addition of two methyl groups to the benzene ring, as in 3,4-dimethylphenol, would typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and a slight increase in van der Waals forces. Each methyl group could contribute approximately +3-5\u00b0C to the melting point. However, the ortho positioning (3,4) of the methyl groups relative to the hydroxyl group may also create some steric hindrance which might disrupt the crystal packing slightly, potentially reducing the melting point enhancement.",
