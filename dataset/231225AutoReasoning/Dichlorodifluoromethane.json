Adding halogens generally increases the molecular weight and intermolecular forces, particularly dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces, thus raising the melting point. Chlorines contribution to raising the melting point can be estimated to be +15 degrees Celsius per atom, due to its size and electron-withdrawing nature. Fluorines effect could be estimated to be around +5 degrees Celsius per atom due to its smaller size compared to chlorine but strong electronegativity which contributes to dipole-dipole interactions. There are two of each halogen, so the cumulative effect of all four halogens would be (2 * 15) + (2 * 5) = 40 degrees Celsius.",

Adding halogens generally increases the melting point due to higher molecular weight and enhanced intermolecular forces. Each chlorine is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to its larger atomic size and significant contribution to van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is expected to increase the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius because of its strong electronegativity and contribution to dipole-dipole interactions despite its smaller size compared to chlorine. With two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms, their combined effects would be (2 * 20) + (2 * 10) = 60 degrees Celsius.",

Fluorine substituents also increase the melting point due to the higher electronegativity and the strong dipole-dipole interactions they introduce.
