        "Reason": "The target compound, 1-fluoro-4-iodobenzene, has a benzene ring as its basic unit which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The fluorine substituent, being electronegative and small, can lead to a dipole-dipole attraction that might slightly increase the melting point but due to its smaller size, the increase will be small, let's say approximately +5 degrees Celsius. On the other hand, the iodine substituent is a large, heavy atom which can introduce significant van der Waals forces, and tends to substantially lower the melting point due to its large surface area interacting with the lattice, let's estimate that effect to be around -40 degrees Celsius. Combining these two effects, we get a net decrease in the melting point.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point is approximately 5.5 (benzene) + 5 (fluorine) - 40 (iodine) = -29.5 degrees Celsius.",
        "Prediction(integer)": -29.0
