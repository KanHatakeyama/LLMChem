        "Reason": "The basic unit here is butane, which has a melting point of -138 degrees Celsius. Adding a hydroxyl (OH) group typically increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds. For small alcohols, this could be an increase of approx. +100 degrees. The amino (NH2) group can also engage in hydrogen bonding, potentially contributing a similar increase of approx. +100 degrees. However, intramolecular hydrogen bonding within the molecule might reduce the overall increase as these groups could interact with each other, thus reducing some intermolecular interactions. This potential reduction might be about -50 degrees. Thus, the overall predicted increase would be +150 degrees from butane's melting point.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit here is butane, which has a melting point of -138 degrees Celsius. Adding a hydroxyl (OH) group usually raises the melting point because it can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds; for simple alcohols, this might result in an increase of around +100 degrees. The amino (NH2) group can also form hydrogen bonds, contributing an increase typically in the order of +50 degrees rather than +100 since it forms weaker hydrogen bonds than OH groups. Considering that these functional groups might partake in intramolecular bonding, the actual increase might be slightly lower, and this intramolecular bonding might diminish the increase by about -10 to -20 degrees. The overall effect from the butane base should result in an increase of approximately +130 to +140 degrees.",
