        "Reason": "The melting point of N-[2-(1H-indol-2-yl)phenyl]acetamide is influenced by several structural features: the base structure is biphenyl, which has a melting point of around 70\u00b0C. The indole group adds rigidity to the structure, which tends to increase melting point due to more restricted rotation around bonds - add approximately +30\u00b0C. The acetamide group can form hydrogen bonds, providing additional intermolecular forces \u2013 add approximately +20\u00b0C. The combination of these functional groups and the overall molecular symmetry suggests an overall significant increase from the biphenyl base structure.",
