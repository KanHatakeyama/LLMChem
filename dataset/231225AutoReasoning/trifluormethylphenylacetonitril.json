        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetonitrile, we need to consider the effects of each functional group compared to benzene. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a phenyl group does not significantly change the melting point as the molecule remains aromatic and planar, hence we start with 5.5\u00b0C. Substituting a hydrogen with a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group typically raises the melting point because of the strong electron-withdrawing nature and the addition of fluorine atoms, which are highly electronegative. This could add about +30\u00b0C due to increased polarity and stronger intermolecular forces. However, the cyano (CN) group usually lowers the melting point because of its linear geometry and the fact that it decreases the overall symmetry and packing efficiency of the molecule, which might subtract approximately -10\u00b0C. Thus, the effects of these groups need to be balanced to predict the overall change in the melting point.",
