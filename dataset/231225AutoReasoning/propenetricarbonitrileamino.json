        "Reason": "The basic unit to consider here might be acetonitrile, with a melting point of -45.7\u00b0C. We will analyze the contributions of different functional groups present in the target compound. The cyano groups (C#N) have significant electron-withdrawing properties and increase intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole interactions, which usually raise the melting point extensively. For each cyano, let's conservatively estimate an increase of +60\u00b0C. There are three cyano groups, which would contribute +180\u00b0C. The amino group (NH2) is capable of hydrogen bonding, which also raises the melting point; however, this can be somewhat offset by the amino group being bonded to a carbon that is part of an alkene, which might slightly lower the melting point due to reduced symmetry or steric hindrance. We might estimate the amino group to contribute +20\u00b0C after considering the alkene's effect. Therefore, the predicted melting point shift due to functional group contributions would be +200\u00b0C when added to the base unit of acetonitrile.",

The cyano groups (C#N) significantly increase the melting point due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature, which enhances intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole interactions. For each cyano group, let's approximate an increase of +60\u00b0C due to the increased polarity and intermolecular attractions. There are three cyano groups, which cumulatively contribute +180\u00b0C. The amino group (NH2) increases the melting point as well, mostly due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, contributing an additional increment; however, the presence of an adjacent alkene (C=C) may slightly decrease the melting point due to the reduced sphericity and possible steric hindrance. Assuming a moderate effect of the amino group, we might estimate its contribution to be around +30\u00b0C. Summing up the contributions from the functional groups gives a total increase of +210\u00b0C when added to the base unit of acetonitrile.",
