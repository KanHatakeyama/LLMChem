Each of the vinyl groups should raise the melting point since they add rigidity to the structure and increase the molecular weight, estimated to be +20\u00b0C per vinyl group. The two carbonyl groups will also raise the melting point because of their ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding with other molecules, estimated to be +30\u00b0C per carbonyl group. This leads to an estimated increase of (2 * 20) + (2 * 30) = 100\u00b0C for the additional groups.",

Adding two ester-containing side chains introduces polar functional groups and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which would significantly raise the melting point. Each ester side chain contributes to increased polarity and intermolecular attractions, such as dipole-dipole interactions and limited hydrogen bonding due to the carbonyl group. The conjugated double bonds within the side chains and across the molecule increase rigidity and molecular stability, which could lead to additional increases in melting point. Quantitatively, each ester side chain with its conjugation can be estimated to raise the melting point by about +60 to +80 \u00b0C. The butenyl groups due to their larger molecular weight and increased London dispersion forces could add an extra +10 \u00b0C each. The conjugated system's contribution to molecular stability might increase the melting point by a further +20 \u00b0C. Combining these effects, we get: Benzene base: +0 (since we are considering increments), each ester and conjugated side chain: 2 x (+60 to +80), each butenyl group: 2 x (+10), and the overall conjugation: +20. This yields an aggregate predicted increase of +140 to +180 \u00b0C on top of the benzene base melting point.",
