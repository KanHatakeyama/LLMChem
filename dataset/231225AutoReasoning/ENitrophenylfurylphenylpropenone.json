        "Reason": "The compound (2E)-3-[5-(3-Nitrophenyl)-2-furyl]-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one has several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic unit to consider here can be a furan ring with a melting point around 31. The additional groups and their estimated effects are as follows: (1) The phenyl group, which tends to increase melting point due to its planar and rigid structure, can be estimated to elevate the melting point by approximately +20. (2) The prop-2-en-1-one side chain, whose polarized double bond and carbonyl group can form additional intermolecular forces, might contribute +40 to the melting point. (3) The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and can significantly raise the melting point by creating more rigid planes for stacking in the solid state; this might contribute an additional +50. Thus, the cumulative estimated increase in melting point due to the addition of these groups is 110 (20 + 40 + 50).",
