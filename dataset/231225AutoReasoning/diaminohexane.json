        "Reason": "The base unit for comparison is hexane, which has a melting point around -95\u00b0C. Adding functional groups to hexane can increase the melting point. Each amine group in 1,6-diaminohexane can form hydrogen bonds, which substantially raises the melting point. The effect of an amine group on the melting point can be estimated to be around +65\u00b0C to +75\u00b0C. Since there are two amine groups in 1,6-diaminohexane, we can calculate the effect as two times this value.",
        "Prediction": "Adding the effect of two amine groups to the base value of hexane: -95 + 2*(65 to 75) = 35\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C",
