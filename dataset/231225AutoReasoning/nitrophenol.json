        "Reason": "The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of approximately 40.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a nitro group generally increases the melting point due to the introduction of strong intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding. The nitro group's electron-withdrawing nature increases the acidity of the adjacent hydroxyl group, promoting stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding. However, it also introduces some steric hindrance due to the size of the nitro group which might slightly reduce the melting point compared to a more linear substituent capable of promoting stronger intermolecular attractions. An approximate increase of about 4 to 5 degrees Celsius can be considered reasonable for the nitro group's effect on the melting point of 2-nitrophenol.",
