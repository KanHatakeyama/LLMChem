        "Reason": "The 1-pentenylboronic acid molecule can be dissected into three key functional group effects on its melting point. First, the base unit here is pentane, which has a very low melting point given it\u2019s a hydrocarbon, approximately -130.0 \u00b0C. The presence of a double bond within the alkyl chain (1-pentenyl) typically raises the melting point as it introduces rigidity to the molecule, for this we can roughly estimate an increase by +20.0 \u00b0C. The boronic acid functional group (B(OH)2) contributes significantly to the melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This could increase the melting point by roughly +190.0 \u00b0C. When we sum up these effects, the overall predicted melting point of 1-pentenylboronic acid can be reached.",
