        "Reason": "Cumic acid consists of several functional groups, each contributing differently to its melting point. The basic unit here can be considered as benzene which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The isopropyl group (two methyl groups on a methine) can be expected to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and slight increase in molecular complexity, let's say by approximately 20 units. The carboxylic acid group is a strongly polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which usually increases the melting point significantly; this could be estimated to add around 50 units to the melting point. However, since the carboxylic acid group also introduces potential for dimerization, which could further increase the melting point, an additional increase of approximately 40 units could be appropriate. Taking all these contributions into account sequentially, the predicted melting point for cumic acid would be calculated as follows: 5.5 (benzene) + 20 (isopropyl) + 50 (carboxylic group base increase) + 40 (carboxylic acid dimerization) = 115.5\u00b0C.",
