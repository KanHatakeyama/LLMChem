        "Reason": "For a,a-dichlorotoluene, the basic unit is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The methyl group typically raises the melting point because it increases the molecular weight and adds some hydrophobic bulk, but this effect is relatively minor, so we can estimate it to add roughly +5\u00b0C. However, the presence of two chlorine atoms, especially being ortho to each other (a,a-position), adds significant mass and polarizability which could lead to stronger intermolecular dipole interactions, but also some steric strain due to their positioning, that can slightly lower the melting point. Thus, we might predict each chlorine to add about -10\u00b0C when considering the balance of increased attractive forces and steric hindrance.",
