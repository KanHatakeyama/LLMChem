        "Reason": "Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, each functional group will affect this melting point. A chlorine substituent, when added to benzene, typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and enhanced polarizability, roughly around +20 degrees Celsius per Cl. However, the introduction of a trifluoromethyl group tends to lower the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature and the induction of a negative inductive effect, which can be estimated at around -40 degrees Celsius. With three chlorine atoms, the effect would be a total of +60 degrees Celsius (3 Cl * +20 degrees Celsius). But the presence of one trifluoromethyl group requires subtracting 40 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the combined estimated effect on benzene's melting point would be +60 - 40 = +20 degrees Celsius.",

        "Reason": "Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, we will adjust for the addition of each functional group. A chlorine substituent typically increases the melting point of benzene due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, contributing approximately +7 degrees Celsius per Cl atom. However, the introduction of a trifluoromethyl group significantly lowers the melting point due to its strong electronegative effect and the induction of a negative inductive effect, which can be estimated to lower the melting point by approximately -45 degrees Celsius. With three chlorine atoms, the net expected increase would be +21 degrees Celsius (+7 degrees Celsius per Cl x 3). Accounting for the presence of one trifluoromethyl group brings us down by 45 degrees Celsius. Combining these effects, the net change would be +21 - 45 = -24 degrees Celsius.",
