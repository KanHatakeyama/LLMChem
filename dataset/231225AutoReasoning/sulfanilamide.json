        "Reason": "Sulfanilamide is an aromatic compound with an amine group and a sulfonamide group. A benzene ring serves as a base unit, which generally has a melting point around 5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the amine group typically raises the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding; we can estimate this effect to be +80 degrees. The sulfonamide group also introduces the potential for additional hydrogen bonding and polarity, further raising the melting point by roughly +70 degrees. The symmetrical distribution of these functional groups on the benzene ring can lead to a more efficient crystal packing, which usually contributes positively to the melting point. Adding these adjustments together, we can estimate the melting point to be above the sum of these effects.",

        "Reason": "Sulfanilamide is an aromatic compound that includes both an amine group and a sulfonamide group attached to a benzene ring. The pure benzene ring has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The amine group can be predicted to increase the melting point due to it enabling hydrogen bonding, and this effect can be quantified as approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The presence of the sulfonamide group also significantly increases the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and increased polarity; this effect can add an additional +90 degrees Celsius. The synergistic effect of these two groups on the melting point due to potential efficient crystal packing and complementary hydrogen bonding could account for an extra increase, which can be estimated conservatively as +20 degrees Celsius. The total increased melting point is the sum of these contributions.",
