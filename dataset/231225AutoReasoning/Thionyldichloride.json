        "Reason": "The basic comparison compound is sulfur dioxide (SO2), which has a melting point of -72\u00b0C. The addition of two chlorine atoms in thionyl chloride (SOCl2) should increase the melting point due to greater molar mass and enhanced van der Waals forces. However, the polar nature of the S-Cl bond and the possibility of intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions can lead to a higher decrease in the melting point, as they can disrupt the crystal lattice. Each chlorine atom may lead to an estimated decrease in melting point by -16\u00b0C.",
