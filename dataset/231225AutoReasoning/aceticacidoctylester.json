        "Reason": "The target compound acetic acid, octyl ester has two main functional groups: the octyl group (alkyl chain) and the ester group. - Basic unit, acetic acid has a melting point of 16.6. - The octyl group makes the compound more hydrophobic and increases its molecular weight, which generally increases the melting point. However, long alkyl chains can also increase the flexibility and decrease the melting point because they prevent efficient packing in the solid state. As a larger alkyl chain (with 8 carbon atoms), the octyl group could have a large impact in this direction. Considering an alkyl group can reduce the melting point by approximately 5-10 degrees per added -(CH2) group beyond the first few carbons, the 7 additional CH2s beyond ethanoic acid would give a reduction of roughly 35-70 degrees. - The ester linkage replaces the hydrogen bonding capability of the acid group with a weaker dipole interaction, further reducing the melting point. Esters often have lower melting points than their corresponding acids. This effect might reduce the melting point by an additional 5-10 degrees.",
