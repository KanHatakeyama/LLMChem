        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is ethane, which has a melting point of -182.8 degrees Celsius. Each methyl group in a straight chain generally increases the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces as a result of increased surface area. However, in the case of propanoic acid, the functional group we need to consider is the carboxyl group (COOH). The carboxyl group has two major effects: First, it increases the melting point substantially due to the capability of forming hydrogen bonds, which are much stronger than van der Waals forces. Second, it has a polar effect that could lower the melting point compared to a nonpolar compound if the compound were to be symmetrical, but since propanoic acid is asymmetrical, this polar effect is minimized. Estimating the effect of each of these is complex, but we can attempt a quantitative analysis. The addition of each methyl group (from methane, which has a melting point of -182.0 degrees Celsius) to form ethane increases the melting point by approximately 9 degrees Celsius (taking into account only van der Waals forces). The addition of the carboxyl group is more substantial; it can raise the melting point of the compound by over 200 degrees Celsius as observed in comparing methane to acetic acid (melting point 16.6 degrees Celsius). However, this effect is not linear and diminishes with the size of the molecule, so we will estimate a smaller increase for propanoic acid.",
