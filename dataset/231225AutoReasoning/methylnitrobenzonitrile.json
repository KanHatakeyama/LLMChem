        "Reason": "The target compound, 3-methyl-4-nitrobenzonitrile, consists of a benzene ring base, a methyl group, a nitro group, and a nitrile group. Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of around 5.5 degrees Celsius, we consider the effects of the substituents. The methyl group may slightly raise the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and hydrophobic character, say by about +5 degrees. Nitro groups are known to significantly increase the melting point because they are strong electron-withdrawing groups and increase the polarity of the molecule; a conservative estimate for the increase might be around +50 degrees. However, the nitro group is meta to the nitrile, slightly reducing its electron-withdrawing effect compared to a para position. The nitrile group also raises the melting point considerably because of the cyano group's ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding with trace water, adding perhaps +25 degrees. Taking all these numbers, we add them to the base benzene melting point to estimate the overall melting point of the compound.",
