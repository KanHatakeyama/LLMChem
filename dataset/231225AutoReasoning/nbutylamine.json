The addition of three methylene groups to form butane would normally increase the melting point incrementally due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each methylene group contributes approximately +44 units to the melting point. However, converting the end carbon to an amine (to form n-butylamine) would lead to increased intermolecular hydrogen bonding, significantly raising the melting point. The amino group in primary amines typically adds about +48 units due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. So the overall prediction should be based on the sum of the increments: methane base value (-182) + 3(CH2 group contribution) + (amino group contribution).",
