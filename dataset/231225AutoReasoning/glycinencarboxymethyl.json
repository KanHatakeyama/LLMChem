        "Reason": "The base compound for comparison will be acetic acid, which has a melting point of 16.7 degrees Celsius. We will then consider the effects of additional functional groups present in N-(carboxymethyl)glycine. First, we have an additional carboxyl group. The presence of this group typically increases the melting point due to the increased ability for hydrogen bonding. This effect can be estimated to add approximately +150 degrees based on similar dicarboxylic acids compared to their monocarboxylic counterparts. Next, there is an amine group adjacent to one of the carboxyl group which can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the said carboxyl group or with other molecules, leading to further increase in the melting point, which can be estimated as +30 degrees. Lastly, there is an additional methylene group in the chain, which could slightly increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions, estimated to be +5 degrees. These adjustments are cumulative.",

        "Reason": "The base compound for comparison will be modified due to the complexity of the target compound, N-(carboxymethyl)glycine, where a simple monocarboxylic acid like acetic acid is insufficient as a comparison. A better base point would be glycine itself, with a melting point around 240 degrees Celsius. Starting with this as our base, we then consider the additional carboxymethyl group attached to the nitrogen. This group introduces additional possibilities for hydrogen bonding, which could raise the melting point due to the stronger intermolecular forces. However, the effect is likely to be less than the incorporation of a full carboxylic acid group given that it is a substitution at the nitrogen rather than the main carbon chain. Considering these factors, the influence of this group may be estimated to add around +10 degrees. Glycine\u2019s high melting point is already due to strong intermolecular forces like zwitterionic interactions and hydrogen bonding, and the additional carboxymethyl may not substantially increase these effects.",
