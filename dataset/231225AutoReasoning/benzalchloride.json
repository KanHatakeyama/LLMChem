        "Reason": "The compound benzal chloride consists of a benzene ring as the basic unit, which has a melting point of +5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of the formyl group (C(=O)H) generally decreases the melting point because it introduces a polarized bond which may disrupt the crystalline structure, approximated to -25 degrees Celsius. However, the two chlorine atoms on the formyl group's adjacent carbon add to the molecular weight and might increase intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions; each chlorine could add +/- 7 degrees Celsius due to their inductive effect and polarity. Overall, the presence of both chlorine atoms might not change the melting point significantly, balancing the polarity added by the formyl group.",
