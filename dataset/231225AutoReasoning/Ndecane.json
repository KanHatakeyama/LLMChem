        "Reason": "The basic unit for N-decane is methane, which has a melting point of -182 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene (CH2) group in a linear alkane typically increases the melting point, as it increases the molecular weight and the van der Waals forces between molecules. For N-decane, which is a chain of ten carbon atoms, 9 additional CH2 groups are included from methane. The effect of each CH2 unit can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +17 degrees Celsius per unit. Thus, the calculation would be as follows: -182 + (9 * +17) as the estimated contribution from the CH2 units.",
