        "Reason": "Basic unit, pyrazole, typically has a melting point in the range of 70 to 100 degrees Celsius. The amino group (-NH2) generally increases the melting point due to the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, potentially adding +20 to +50 degrees. The nitrile group (-C\u2261N) is electron-withdrawing and can also participate in dipole-dipole interactions, possibly adding +10 to +30 degrees. Each group's effects might not be simply additive due to potential intramolecular interactions, but for this estimation we'll consider an additive model.",
