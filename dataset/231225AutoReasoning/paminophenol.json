        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C (42\u00b0F). An amino group (-NH2) when substituted on the benzene ring generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. The increase from an amino group can be roughly estimated to be +100\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group (-OH) also contributes to an increased melting point through hydrogen bonding. The introduction of an -OH group can be expected to add approximately +80\u00b0C. Additionally, since they are in the para position relative to each other, they can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which further stabilizes the structure and may slightly enhance the melting point, but this will be considered minimal as it's difficult to quantify and the two major functional group effects already account for significant hydrogen bonding interactions. Both substituents also add some steric hindrance and dipole interactions compared to benzene, but their major effect is through hydrogen bonding.",
