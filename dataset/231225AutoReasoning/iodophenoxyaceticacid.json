        "Reason": "The target compound 4-iodophenoxyacetic acid contains several functional groups that influence its melting point: a phenyl ring (basic structure similar to benzene), an iodo substituent, a phenoxy group, and an acetic acid moiety. Benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, which we will use as our starting point. The iodo substituent is a heavy halogen that typically increases the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and the introduction of stronger intermolecular van der Waals forces, we estimate this could increase the value by approximately +80\u00b0C. The phenoxy group (phenyl ether) introduces some polarity and potential for additional intermolecular interactions, possibly adding another +10\u00b0C. The acetic acid group contributes significantly to the melting point through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, increasing the value by about +70\u00b0C.",
