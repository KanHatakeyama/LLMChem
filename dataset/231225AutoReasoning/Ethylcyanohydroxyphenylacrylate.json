        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of Ethyl 2-cyano-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acrylate, we start with the base structure of styrene, which has a melting point around -30\u00b0C. Each functional group will then be considered for its contribution to the melting point: \n- The cyano group (C#N) adds rigidity and polarity to the molecule which increases intermolecular forces, leading to an increase in the melting point. Let's estimate this effect to be about +80\u00b0C. \n- The hydroxy group (attached to the phenyl ring) can form hydrogen bonds, significantly increasing the melting point. We can estimate this increase to be about +100\u00b0C. \n- The ethyl ester moiety (OCC) is not a particularly polar group, and might contribute slightly to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. This might be an increase of around +30\u00b0C. \nTherefore, the cumulative effect of these functional groups on the base structure of styrene leads to a predicted melting point.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point is -30 (styrene base) + 80 (cyano group) + 100 (hydroxy group) + 30 (ethyl ester) = 180\u00b0C.",
        "Prediction(integer)": 180.0
