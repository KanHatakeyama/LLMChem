        "Reason": "The melting point of the basic unit benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. Bromine is a heavy substituent which generally decreases melting point because it increases the molecular weight and also disrupts the crystal lattice due to its large size. This would be estimated to decrease the melting point by around 40\u00b0C. Each fluorine substituent, however, has the ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions and possibly hydrogen bonds if traces of water or protic solvents are present, leading to an increase in the melting point. This effect might increase the melting point by about 20\u00b0C for each fluorine. The combined effect of two fluorines would be an increase of 40\u00b0C.",
