        "Reason": "The compound 1-aminonaphthalene contains a naphthalene base and an amino (-NH2) group. The basic unit, naphthalene has a melting point of 80.7\u00b0C. The amino group typically decreases the melting point due to its capability to donate a hydrogen bond, reducing intermolecular attractive forces when compared to the pure hydrocarbon. We can approximate this reduction to be around -32.2\u00b0C.",
