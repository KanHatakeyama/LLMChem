        "Reason": "The diethyl maleate molecule has several functional groups that will affect its melting point. The basic unit here can be considered as the ethylene (C=C) with a typical melting point around -169\u00b0C. The two ester groups (COO) tend to decrease the melting point as they disrupt crystal packing due to their bulky size and the presence of oxygen atoms that do not allow them to pack as efficiently as straight-chain hydrocarbons. Each COO group typically lowers the melting point by approximately -50\u00b0C. In contrast, the double bond C=C might slightly increase the melting point due to planarity and rigidity, but this effect is relatively small (approximately +5\u00b0C). When considering all these effects together, the predicted melting point of diethyl maleate should be lower than that of a simple hydrocarbon chain.",
