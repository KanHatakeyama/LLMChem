        "Reason": "The target compound epichlorohydrin has three main functional groups that will influence its melting point: the epoxide ring, the methylene group, and the chlorine substituent. Basic unit (ethylene oxide) has a melting point of -111.3\u00b0C. The addition of a methylene group (+CH2) typically increases the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces, let's estimate this as +20\u00b0C. Chlorine is a larger atom compared to hydrogen and will thus introduce more van der Waals interactions and possibly some dipole-dipole interactions, which would generally increase the melting point. Estimating the effect of the chlorine substituent as +30\u00b0C. Adding these adjustments together gives us a predicted melting point.",
