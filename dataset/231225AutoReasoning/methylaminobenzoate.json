        "Reason": "The basic unit for methyl 3-aminobenzoate is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. An ester functional group (COOCH3) is generally polar and can increase the melting point due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions, I estimate this to raise the melting point by about 45\u00b0C. An amino group (NH2) can donate hydrogen bonds, raising the melting point significantly due to the high strength of hydrogen bonds. I estimate this could raise it by about 60\u00b0C. However, these are attached to a benzene ring that can allow for some delocalization of charge and slightly reduce the increase in melting point. I estimate this reduction to be approximately -10\u00b0C for this aromatic system. The presence of both functional groups on the same ring could have additional stabilizing effects due to intramolecular interactions possibly lowering the expected increases slightly.",

An ester functional group (COOCH3) is typically polar and can increase the melting point due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding capabilities. I estimate this to raise the melting point by about 50\u00b0C. An amino group (NH2) is capable of hydrogen bonding and can significantly raise the melting point, which I estimate to be around 80\u00b0C increase. However, when connected to a benzene ring, the contribution of each group may slightly decrease due to conjugation and partial charge delocalization, which could decrease the overall impact on the melting point. Considering both effects, the aromatic system's conjugation and intramolecular interactions might reduce the impacts to about 30\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C for the ester and amino groups, respectively.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for methyl 3-aminobenzoate is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of approximately 122 degrees Celsius. The presence of an amino group (-NH2) in the meta position relative to the carboxyl group has two effects: 1) it introduces hydrogen bonding, which tends to increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces, and 2) it creates a dipole due to its electron-donating effect, which could slightly reduce the effect of the increase caused by hydrogen bonding. A reasonable estimate for this increase might be +20 degrees Celsius. However, the methyl ester group (COOCH3) present replaces the acidic hydrogen of the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, which normally would allow for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The ester group significantly disrupts this hydrogen bonding network, leading to a substantial decrease in the melting point. We could estimate this decrease to be around -90 degrees Celsius. These adjustments combined give us a net change relative to benzoic acid.",
