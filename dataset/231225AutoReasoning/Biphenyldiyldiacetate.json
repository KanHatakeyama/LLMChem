        "Reason": "The basic unit for this consideration can be biphenyl, which has a melting point of 71 degrees Celsius. Adding acetoxy functional groups (OC(=O)C) typically increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding interactions. The presence of two of these groups is expected to have an additive effect. Each acetoxy group can increase the melting point by approximately 45 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the additive effect of two acetoxy groups can be estimated as 45 * 2 = 90 degrees Celsius increase over the base melting point of biphenyl.",
