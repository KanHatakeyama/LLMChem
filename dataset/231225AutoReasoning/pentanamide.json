        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of pentanamide, we must examine its structural components and related intermolecular forces. The compound's base structure is pentane, which has a melting point of about -130 degrees Celsius. Adding the amide functional group (CONH2) significantly increases the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization of the amide bond, as amides exhibit high melting points relative to other organic compounds. Considering the effects of each functional group, the increase could be around +236 degrees Celsius.",
