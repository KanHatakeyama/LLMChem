        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound, n-pentadecane, has a melting point of around 9.95\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group at the third carbon to form 3-methyltetradecane results in a slight decrease in melting point due to the branching which interferes with the orderly packing of molecules, which is important for crystalline solids like alkanes. The methyl group is relatively small, so we can estimate this decrease to be around -42\u00b0C from the baseline of the n-pentadecane.",
