        "Reason": "Valerophenone is comprised of a phenyl group attached to a pentanoyl group. The basic unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. An aliphatic chain like pentyl generally lowers the melting point because it increases the molecular size and disrupts the crystalline structure of the solid, making it easier to melt. Here, the pentyl group may lower the melting point by approximately 40\u00b0C. Additionally, the carbonyl group (C=O) tends to increase the melting point due to its ability to accept and donate hydrogen bonds, adding around 20\u00b0C. However, the bulky pentyl group's effect is dominant over the carbonyl group's hydrogen bonding capability in this case.",
