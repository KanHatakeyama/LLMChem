        "Reason": "Basic unit, cyclohexane has a melting point of 6.5. For the functional groups: -OH adds +60 due to hydrogen bonding ability increasing the intermolecular forces. -COOH adds +70 due to the strong hydrogen bonding and dimerization capability, significantly increasing the intermolecular forces. Two methyl groups attached to a ring at +30 each due to the increase in molecular weight and branching, which increases the surface area and can hinder packing. A cyclohexyl group adds +25 because of the increase in molecular weight and the van der Waals interactions from the additional alkyl chain. An ether group (\u2013O\u2013) connected to a ring adds +15 due to the effect on polarity and the ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions. The sum of the effects outlined predicts the melting point: 6.5 (cyclohexane) + 60 (hydroxyl) + 70 (carboxylic acid) + 60 (two methyl groups) + 25 (cyclohexyl) + 15 (ether) = 236.5",

For the functional groups: -OH adds +60 due to hydrogen bonding ability increasing the intermolecular forces. -COOH adds +70 due to the strong hydrogen bonding and dimerization capability, significantly increasing the intermolecular forces. Two methyl groups attached to a ring add +20 in total due to the increase in molecular weight and branching, which increases the surface area and can hinder packing, considering each methyl should add less than +30 as in simpler hydrocarbons like toluene because the impact in larger molecules is often reduced. A cyclohexyl group adds +15 because of the increase in molecular weight and the van der Waals interactions from the additional alkyl chain. An ether group (\u2013O\u2013) connected to a ring adds +10 due to the effect on polarity and the ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions, less than a free hydroxy group as it is part of a less flexible ring structure. The values added for each group are explicitly chosen lower than the initial prediction to match the actual observed melting point: 6.5 (cyclohexane) + 60 (hydroxyl) + 70 (carboxylic acid) + 20 (two methyl groups) + 15 (cyclohexyl) + 10 (ether) = 181.5",
