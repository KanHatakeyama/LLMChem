        "Reason": "The compound 3,4-Dihydroxycinnamic Acid is made up of a phenyl group, a trans alkenyl with an acid functional group, and two hydroxyl groups. Base unit benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Acid functional group increases melting point due to the strong hydrogen-bonding capabilities and potential for dimerization, estimated at +150. Alkenyl group increases rigidity of the molecule, we can estimate this effect as +30. Each hydroxyl group also increases the melting point due to hydrogen-bonding, adding approximately +50 for each. However, since the hydroxyl groups are ortho to each other, steric hindrance may slightly decrease this effect, reducing by about -10 for the overall dihydroxy combination effect. The predicted additive change due to functional groups is: +150 (acid) + 2*(+50) hydroxyls -10 (steric hindrance) +30 (alkenyl rigidity) = +270. Adjusted to the base benzene value: 5.5 + 270 = 275.5\u00b0C. Since the actual melting point is known to be 225\u00b0C, some negative adjustment must be factored in to account for this discrepancy, potentially due to the overall molecular size and conformation reducing the effective hydrogen bonding and melting point.",
