        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point value of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of an allyl group (C=C-C-) attached to the benzene ring generally decreases the melting point because the propenyl chain disrupts the symmetry and packing efficiency of the benzene crystals, which typically lowers the melting point. The vinyl group (C=C) introduces some rigidity, but the overall effect of the allyl group is to lower the melting point. The approximate decrease due to the allyl group is -50.5\u00b0C, which considers both the slight rigidity of the double bond and the longer alkyl chain disrupting the crystalline structure.",
