        "Reason": "The compound maltitol is a sugar alcohol with a structure closely related to that of sucrose. Generally, sugar alcohols have moderate to high melting points due to the extensive hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups. In the case of maltitol, we will consider the effects of its functional groups:\n\n- Basic sugar unit (like glucose): around 146\u00b0C, as a reference value for monosaccharides.\n- Additional sugar unit: +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular size and additional hydrogen bonding opportunities.\n- Sugar alcohol (vs sugar): -15\u00b0C because the replacement of an aldehyde or ketone group by an alcoholic hydroxyl group usually leads to a decrease in melting point due to less rigid structure compared to the cyclic hemiacetal forms in sugars.\n\nTherefore, the predicted melting point would be the sum of the effects of these groups.",
