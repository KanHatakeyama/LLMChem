        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C for reference. When two benzene rings are connected to form biphenyl, the potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and an increase in molecular weight contributes to a significantly higher melting point compared to a single benzene ring, estimated at around +180\u00b0C. Each nitrile (C#N) group, being a strong polar group, can engage in dipole-dipole interactions and thus would each further increase the melting point by about +25\u00b0C. Therefore, we consider the effects of the biphenyl's increase and the two nitrile groups' contributions.",
