        "Reason": "For 4-morpholineethanol, the basic unit we can consider is ethanol which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The morpholine ring (C4H8ON) adds rigidity and introduces nitrogen's capability for hydrogen bonding, which would increase the melting point. The influence of the morpholine ring is quite substantial, as it not only increases molecular weight, but also greatly increases the potential for hydrogen bonding interactions compared to the basic ethanol structure. We can estimate the morpholine effect to be approximately +110 degrees Celsius due to these factors. Thus, the combined effect of the ethanol backbone and the morpholine substitution can be quantitatively considered to predict the melting point of the compound.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point for 4-morpholineethanol would be the sum of ethanol's melting point and the estimated morpholine ring effect: -114.1 (ethanol) + 110 (morpholine ring) = -4.1 degrees Celsius.",
        "Prediction(integer)": -4.0
