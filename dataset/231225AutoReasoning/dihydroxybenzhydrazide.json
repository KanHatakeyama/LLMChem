        "Reason": "The compound 3,5-dihydroxybenzhydrazide consists of a benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups and a benzhydrazide functional group. Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, we then consider the effects of the substituents. Each hydroxyl group significantly increases the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding; we can estimate an increase of +80 degrees Celsius per hydroxyl group. The benzhydrazide group, consisting of the CONHNH2 moiety, also contributes to higher melting points through the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and the extended conjugation system that results in higher polarity and molecular rigidity. The addition of this group can increase the melting point by approximately +90 degrees Celsius. Summing the contributions, we acquire the predicted melting point.",
        "Prediction": "Benzene (5.5) + Hydroxyl groups (2 * 80) + Benzhydrazide group (90) = 255.5 degrees Celsius",
