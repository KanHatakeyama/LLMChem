        "Reason": "The target compound, sec-butylacetate, can be decomposed into its functional groups for analysis. The basic structural unit, ethyl acetate, has a melting point of -83.6 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group in ethyl acetate would be modified to a sec-butyl group (sec-C4H9-) in sec-butylacetate. The sec-butyl group is larger than the ethyl group, which increases the molecular weight and provides more surface area for van der Waals interactions, thus raising the melting point. However, the branching in the sec-butyl group reduces the effectiveness of van der Waals forces compared to a straight chain, which ultimately leads to a decrease in melting point. Considering these factors, the increase in molecular weight might contribute an approximate +5 degrees Celsius shift due to the larger group, whereas the branching might contribute a decrease of -20 degrees Celsius due to decreased packing efficiency. Combined, this would result in a predicted melting point shift of -15 degrees Celsius compared to ethyl acetate.",
