        "Reason": "For predicting the melting point of anilazine, we need to consider the various functional groups present in the molecule and how they affect the melting point compared to a known reference. The basic unit we can start with is benzene, known for its stable ring structure, and its melting point is 5.5\u00b0C. In anilazine, there are several functional groups to consider: 1) The presence of the chlorine substituents, which are electron-withdrawing groups through their inductive effect and provide intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine atom can be expected to increase the melting point by approximately +15\u00b0C due to greater molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces. 2) The triazine functional group (s-triazine ring), which can engage in hydrogen bonding and has a relatively rigid structure, can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +100\u00b0C due to the additional nitrogen atoms and the rigidity of the heterocyclic ring. 3) The aniline moiety (phenylamine), which would typically contribute through aromaticity and potential for hydrogen bonding, might increase the melting point by roughly +25\u00b0C. Combining these effects and starting from benzene's melting point, the calculation will be as follows: Benzene (5.5) + 3*Chlorine (3*15) + Triazine (100) + Aniline (25).",

        "Reason": "The melting point of anilazine must be predicted by examining the effects of its multiple functional groups relative to a basic reference compound. We start with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Anilazine has several functional groups that influence its melting point: 1) There are three chlorine atoms in anilazine, and each is likely to raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and enhanced van der Waals interactions; the effect of each chlorine can be approximated at +20\u00b0C. 2) The triazine ring, being a heterocyclic compound containing three nitrogen atoms, increases the rigidity of the molecule and can participate in hydrogen bonding, contributing to a significant increase in melting point. We can estimate this effect to be about +90\u00b0C. 3) The anilino (phenylamine) group introduces the potential for additional \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and some limited hydrogen bonding capability, though less so than aliphatic amines due to the resonance stabilization of the lone pair on nitrogen. The influence of this group can be estimated at +10\u00b0C. By combining these effects with the base melting point of benzene, we estimate the melting point as: 5.5 (benzene baseline) + 3*(20) (chlorines) + 90 (triazine ring) + 10 (anilino group).",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyrazine, has a melting point around 55\u00b0C. Chloro groups generally increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and ability to engage in stronger intermolecular forces; for simplicity, let's estimate around +20\u00b0C per chloro group present in the molecule. There are four chloro groups, which would suggest an increase of +80\u00b0C. The phenyl group (benzene ring) is known to raise the melting point as well, due to increased planarity and potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions; an estimated increase of +25\u00b0C. Finally, the primary amino group, which can form hydrogen bonds, further raises the melting point; we can estimate this increase at about +15\u00b0C. Adding these values together gives a total increase of 120\u00b0C to the basic pyrazine unit.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyrazine, has a melting point around 55\u00b0C. Chloro groups usually increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and capacity for stronger intermolecular forces; however, the estimation is slightly high. A more conservative estimation would be +15\u00b0C per chloro group present in the molecule. There are four chloro groups, which would then suggest an increase of +60\u00b0C. The phenyl group (aromatic benzene ring) typically contributes to a higher melting point due to enhanced planarity and potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions; for this, let's estimate an increase of +25\u00b0C. Lastly, the primary amino group can form hydrogen bonds, but its impact on the melting point may not be as large as +15\u00b0C because it also introduces a site for potential intermolecular interactions that do not necessarily raise the melting point. An estimated increase for the amino group can be around +10\u00b0C. Thus, the cumulative adjustment from these functional groups is +95\u00b0C.",
