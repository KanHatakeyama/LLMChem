        "Reason": "The compound dichlorofluoroacetonitrile consists of a cyano group (-C#N) attached to a carbon that is also bound to two chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom. Considering each functional group's contribution: \n- Basic unit, acetonitrile, has a boiling point of around 82 degrees Celsius. \n- The cyano group generally increases molecular complexity and the ability for dipoles moments and potential hydrogen bonding sites, but in this case, it is the basic unit in itself and is already accounted for. \n- Chlorine atoms are large halogens and heavily electron-withdrawing, which increases intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine may contribute to a significant decrease in the melting point due to the increased size and mass, but also may increase the melting point slightly due to enhanced van der Waals interactions. An estimated change could be approximately -15 degrees Celsius for each chlorine atom due to the combined effects. \n- Fluorine is a smaller halogen compared to chlorine and has a higher electronegativity, leading to stronger intermolecular forces than chlorine, especially dipole-dipole interactions. The influence of fluorine could be estimated around -5 degrees Celsius as it enhances the intermolecular forces while also adding to the molecular size and weight. \nThese effects combined and weighed against the basic acetonitrile structure would lead to the estimated melting point of the compound.",
