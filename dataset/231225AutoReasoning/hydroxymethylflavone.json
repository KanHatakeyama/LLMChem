        "Reason": "The foundational structure for 3'-hydroxy-6-methylflavone is flavone, which has a melting point of approximately 95\u00b0C. The flavone structure provides a basis with conjugated double bonds and a planar structure that allows for stable pi-pi stacking interactions, which generally increase the melting point. The effects of the additional functional groups are as follows: - Hydroxyl group: This polar, hydrogen-bond-donating group will significantly increase the melting point due to the possibility of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Assuming this effect can be roughly +50\u00b0C for each hydroxyl group. There are two hydroxyl groups, so +100\u00b0C in total. - Methyl group: The addition of a small hydrophobic group like a methyl group increases the molecular weight and provides additional van der Waals interactions. However, this effect is more modest compared to the hydroxyl groups, let's estimate this to be +10\u00b0C. Based on these considerations, the expected increase relative to the base structure of flavone would be around +110\u00b0C.",
