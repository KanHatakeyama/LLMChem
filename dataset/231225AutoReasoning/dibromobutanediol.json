        "Reason": "The starting point for the prediction would be the melting point of 1,4-butanediol, which has two hydroxyl groups that can form hydrogen bonds. The base melting point of 1,4-butanediol is approximately 20-21 degrees Celsius. Introduction of bromine atoms will generally increase the molecular weight and the van der Waals forces within the molecule, typically leading to an increase in melting point. Each bromine substitution can be estimated to add around 30-35 degrees Celsius because of the increased molecular weight and the polarizability of the bromine atoms. Hydroxyl groups also affect the melting point by forming hydrogen bonds; compared to hydrogen atoms, hydroxyls might add about 50-60 degrees Celsius each due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding capabilities. However, this effect has already been included in the base structure of 1,4-butanediol, and since the effect of the hydroxyl groups is shared, their addition effect in melting point is reduced when considering additional functional groups. As such, we consider the effect of two bromines on the 1,4-butanediol structure.",
