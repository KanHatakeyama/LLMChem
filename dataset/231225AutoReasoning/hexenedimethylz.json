        "Reason": "The compound 3-hexene, 2,2-dimethyl-, (z)- can be broken down into its functional components to predict the melting point. The base molecule could be considered hexene, which has a melting point around -140\u00b0C. A double bond generally decreases melting point due to less efficient packing. However, the presence of cis (Z) configuration could enhance molecular packing compared to trans (E) isomers, slightly raising the melting point. Each methyl group may slightly raise the melting point due to increased steric hindrance and molecular size leading to better packing. For illustration, one might estimate each methyl group to raise the melting point by approximately 2\u00b0C.",
        "Prediction": "-134\u00b0C (Base hexene -140\u00b0C; Z-configuration +1\u00b0C; two additional methyl groups +2\u00b0C each; cis double bond, inefficient packing -3\u00b0C)",
