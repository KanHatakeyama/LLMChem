        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of polar and hydrogen-bonding capable functional groups such as the amide group typically increases the melting point significantly due to enhanced intermolecular forces. An amide group can raise the melting point by approximately 180\u00b0C due to its ability to form strong hydrogen bonds. The bromine atom is large and heavy and can also raise the melting point through increased London dispersion forces, but to a much lesser extent than hydrogen bonding, with an estimated increase of around 15\u00b0C.",

We estimate this increase to be around 150\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding. The bromine atom contributes to higher melting point as well through increased London dispersion forces, although its effect is less significant than that of the amide. We can conservatively estimate the increase due to the bromine atom to be about 5\u00b0C.",
