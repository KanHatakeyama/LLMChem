        "Reason": "The basic unit, ethylene (with a double bond), has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene group (CH2) in a straight chain alkane increases the melting point as it increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. For a straight-chain alkene similar to 1-tridecene, the introduction of around 11 methylene groups would increase the melting point significantly. Each methylene addition raises the melting point of a hydrocarbon chain by an average of approximately +13.5 degrees Celsius. However, the terminal double bond in 1-tridecene presents a minimal effect on melting point compared to the influence of the added methylene groups because it slightly decreases the molecular symmetry and provides slightly less rigid structure than a single bond. This might reduce the melting point by about -2 degrees Celsius. Therefore, taking -169.2 plus 11 methylene increments (11 x 13.5) and subtracting 2 degrees for the double bond gives a predicted value.",
