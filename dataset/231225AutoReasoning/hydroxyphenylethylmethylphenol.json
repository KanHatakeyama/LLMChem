        "Reason": "The compound 2-(1-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl)-4-methylphenol is composed of two phenyl rings and one tertiary alcohol group, as well as a methyl substituent. The melting point of a basic benzene molecule is approximately 5.53\u00b0C. Each additional ring typically raises the melting point due to increased pi-stacking and van der Waals interactions; we can estimate this increase to be around +30\u00b0C per additional ring. The tertiary alcohol group (phenol) is likely to engage in hydrogen bonding, further increasing the melting point by approximately +80\u00b0C. A methyl group, being electron-donating, marginally stabilizes the structure but does not significantly alter the melting point; the effect may be around +5\u00b0C. Therefore, the total predicted shift due to two additional rings, one methyl group, and a tertiary alcohol group would be (+30 * 2) + (+80) + (+5) = +145\u00b0C. However, the steric hindrance introduced by substituents may reduce this effect somewhat, so a slight adjustment will be made, resulting in a prediction that is slightly less than the calculated value.",
