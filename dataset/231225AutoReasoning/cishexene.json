        "Reason": "The basic unit we can consider for prediction is ethene (ethylene), which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The cis-2-hexene structure has additional CH2 groups extending the carbon chain. Each CH2 group increment generally raises the melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C as with increasing molecular weight and van der Waals forces, melting points typically increase. However, considering the cis double bond slightly lowers the melting point due to less effective packing compared to trans isomers, we might estimate a -5\u00b0C effect for the cis double bond. Therefore, we have one cis double bond and four additional CH2 groups compared to ethene.",
