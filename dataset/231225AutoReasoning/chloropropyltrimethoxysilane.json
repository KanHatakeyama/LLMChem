        "Reason": "The basic unit for estimation would be silane, SiH4, which has a melting point around -185\u00b0C. Chloropropyl group will raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces (+80). Each methoxy group will also increase the melting point due to similar reasons, but to a lesser extent than chloropropyl group, so approximate value for each methoxy group could be +18. Thus, for three methoxy groups, we have a combined effect of (+18 * 3) = +54. The cumulative effect would be +80 (for the chloropropyl group) and +54 (for three methoxy groups) added to the base silane melting point of -185\u00b0C.",
