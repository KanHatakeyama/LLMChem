        "Reason": "The basic unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The chloro group is an electron-withdrawing group and it increases intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, which typically increases the melting point by about +40\u00b0C when ortho to another substituent due to the increased polarity and potential for strong intermolecular interactions. The cyano group is also an electron-withdrawing group, and it can significantly increase the melting point by about +70\u00b0C because of its strong polar nature and ability to form solid-state interactions. These effects are somewhat cumulative, but because they are situated ortho to each other, there may be steric hindrance that slightly lessens the overall increase. Taking these aspects into account, the overall increase might be slightly less than the sum of the individual effects.",

The chlorine substituent has multiple effects: it is an electron-withdrawing group that can participate in polar interactions and its atomic mass and size also contribute to the van der Waals interactions, which further increases the melting point; a reasonable estimate for chloro addition could be an increase of about +30\u00b0C.

The introduction of electronegative substituents like chlorine (Cl) and the nitrile group (CN) will have differing effects on the melting point. The chlorine atom, being more electronegative, will engage in stronger intermolecular interactions like dipole-dipole attractions, which can significantly increase the melting point, approximately by +60 to +80\u00b0C. The nitrile group not only increases the molecular weight but also contributes to the dipolarity of the molecule, which further increases the melting point. However, the effect of the nitrile group is usually less pronounced than that of halogens on melting points, so it might contribute an additional increase of around +10 to +20\u00b0C.",
