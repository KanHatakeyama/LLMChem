        "Reason": "The compound 1,3-di-p-tolyl-2-thiourea consists of several functional groups that affect its melting point. The analysis of the melting point shift should consider the base structure of benzene, the influence of substituted methyl groups, the thiourea moiety, and biphenyl interaction. First, benzene, as the basic unit, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of methyl groups typically increases the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces, so each p-tolyl group is estimated to bring a +20\u00b0C increment. There are two p-tolyl groups attached to the thiourea. The thiourea group itself is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, substantially raising the melting point. We may estimate this effect to be around +125\u00b0C. Furthermore, the biphenyl interaction (phenyl groups on both ends of thiourea) can lead to additional \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, increasing rigidity and raising the melting point by another +15\u00b0C. Combining these effects, we should predict the melting point as follows: 5.5 (benzene) + 2 * 20 (two p-tolyl groups) + 125 (thiourea moiety) + 15 (biphenyl interaction) = 185.5\u00b0C.",
