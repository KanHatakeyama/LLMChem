        "Reason": "The basic unit for 1-Allylthiourea is thiourea, which has a melting point of 182 degrees Celsius. The allyl group, which is a substituent, generally decreases the melting point due to its ability to interfere with the packing of molecules, which is important for a solid's stability. The estimated effect of the allyl group could be around -50 degrees Celsius. The amine group typically raises the melting point due to potential hydrogen bonding. However, since thiourea already has amine groups which contribute to its high melting point, the effect of an additional amine on the melting point in this case would be minimal, approximately +5 degrees Celsius. Overall, the bulky allyl group has a larger impact by disrupting the crystal lattice more than the additional amine group can stabilize it with hydrogen bonding.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for 1-Allylthiourea is thiourea, which has a melting point of 182 degrees Celsius. The allyl group is a substituent that generally decreases the melting point because it disrupts the molecular packing in the solid state, leading to a reduction of the intermolecular forces that contribute to a higher melting point. Assuming a similar influence as an alkyl group, the effect of the allyl group should be substantial. For alkyl groups, such a substituent could typically lower the melting point by approximately -110 degrees Celsius due to the introduction of steric hindrance and a reduction in symmetry. The amine group usually raises the melting point due to potential for hydrogen bonding. Given that thiourea already contains NH groups that participate in extensive hydrogen bonding and given the subtle difference an additional amine could make in an already hydrogen-bond-rich environment, the impact of the amine group would be a minor increase in the melting point, estimated at about +10 degrees Celsius. The large negative effect of the allyl group will dominate over the slight positive effect of the amine group.",

The amine groups in thiourea engage in strong hydrogen bonding, which is partly retained in 1-allylthiourea but slightly weakened due to the alkyl chain, so we might reduce the melting point by an additional -10\u00b0C for each amine affected.

In this case, the alkyl group's influence in reducing melting point can be approximated at around -30\u00b0C. The amine groups in thiourea engage in strong hydrogen bonding. In 1-allylthiourea, the hydrogen bonding capacity is diminished due to the introduction of the allyl group; this might lower the melting point by roughly -10\u00b0C. Since there are two amino groups and only one is affected by the allylic substitution, the reduction should be applied once.

        "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit, we look at thiourea which has a melting point around 182 degrees Celsius. The large disparity between thiourea and 1-Allylthiourea's melting point can be attributed to several structural modifications. First, the allyl group (C3H5) introduces unsaturation and reduces intermolecular forces due to less effective packing compared to the more symmetrical thiourea, likely lowering the melting point by around -50 degrees. Secondly, replacing a hydrogen with the allyl group also increases the molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point. However, the influence of the increased weight is substantially outweighed by the steric and electronic effects that disrupt crystal packing, so we estimate this to counteract the unsaturation effect by about +10 degrees. Overall, we predict a significant decrease in the melting point due to the introduction of the allyl group.",

The introduction of the allyl group (C3H5) to form 1-Allylthiourea introduces unsaturation with a double bond and a longer alkyl chain, which would typically reduce the ability of the molecules to pack tightly together in the solid state, likely lowering the melting point. The effect of the allyl group can be estimated to decrease the melting point by around -80 degrees due to steric hindrance and less effective molecular packing. On the other hand, the allyl group does increase the molecular weight which could contribute to a higher melting point, but this effect is minor compared to the impact of the unsaturation and steric effects of the allyl group. Considering these opposing factors, we attribute a net change of about -70 degrees Celsius to the introduction of the allyl group to thiourea.",
