        "Reason": "The target compound, 3,4-Dichlorophenol, is structurally composed of a benzene ring with two chlorine substituents and one hydroxyl group. The basic unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Chlorine substituents are deactivating, electron-withdrawing groups that form stronger intermolecular interactions due to their increased polarity; each may raise the melting point. Each chlorine might contribute approximately +40\u00b0C due to the increased intermolecular forces from the polar C-Cl bonds. The hydroxyl group is a strongly polar functional group that can form hydrogen bonds, significantly increasing intermolecular interactions. It can contribute +70\u00b0C to the melting point. Collectively, these modifications would be additive. However, there may be a smaller contribution from each substituent due to steric hindrance and the fact that they may not purely have additive effects.",

        "Reason": "The target compound, 3,4-Dichlorophenol, incorporates a phenol (hydroxyl-benzene) unit with additional chlorine substituents. Phenol itself has a melting point of approximately 41\u00b0C, much higher than benzene due to the strong hydrogen-bonding capability of the hydroxyl group. Each chlorine substituent, being an electron-withdrawing group, adds to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and the polarity of the molecule. Chlorine's contribution is somewhat less than that of a hydroxyl group due to its lesser impact on intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Considering an approximate increase of +11\u00b0C for each chlorine atom and taking into account that the hydroxyl group's effect is already counted in phenol's base melting point, the predicted melting point would be increased by the effects of the two chlorines.",
