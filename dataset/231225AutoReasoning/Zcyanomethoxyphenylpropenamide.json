        "Reason": "The target compound, (2Z)-2-cyano-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)prop-2-enamide, can be analyzed by looking at the individual functional groups and their effect on the melting point:\n- Basic unit, benzene, has a reference melting point of approximately 5.5\u00b0C.\n- Phenyl group: a large, planar, and rigid structure that tends to stack well in the solid state, leading to generally higher melting points. Estimated effect: +100\u00b0C.\n- Nitrile (cyano) group: a polar functional group that can enable strong dipole-dipole interactions and possibly hydrogen-bonding with nearby molecules, leading to an increase in melting point. Estimated effect: +85\u00b0C.\n- Amide group: a highly polar functionality capable of strong hydrogen bonding, which usually gives a substantial increase in melting point. Estimated effect: +120\u00b0C.\n- Methoxy group: an alkoxy substituent like methoxy typically raises the melting point slightly due to its polarity, but less so than nitro, cyano, or amide groups. Estimated effect: +20\u00b0C.\n- Alkene group: has minimal direct effects on melting points, as it neither significantly increases nor decreases polarity or the ability of molecules to pack. Estimated effect: 0\u00b0C.\nConsidering the cumulative effects of these functional groups, the overall increase in melting point relative to benzene can be predicted.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (benzene) + 100 (phenyl) + 85 (nitrile) + 120 (amide) + 20 (methoxy) = 330.5\u00b0C",
