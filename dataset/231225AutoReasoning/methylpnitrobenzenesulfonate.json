        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The electronegative nitro group (-NO2) is a strong withdrawing group through both inductive and mesomeric effects, significantly adding to the intermolecular forces and increases the rigidity and stability of the compound, leading to a substantial increase in the melting point (+80). The methanesulfonyloxy (-CH3SO2O) substituent with its strong electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group and additional oxygen atoms also adds to the overall polarity and the ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds, leading to another substantial increase (+40). The combined effects of the substituted groups result in a much higher melting point for methyl p-nitrobenzenesulfonate compared to benzene.",

The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) attached to the benzene ring significantly increases the melting point; the nitro group is a strong withdrawing group and stabilizes the compound through its resonance and inductive effects (+60). The methanesulfonyloxy (-CH3SO2O) group is electron-withdrawing due to the sulfonyl moiety and introduces additional polarity and the ability to form strong intermolecular interactions, including potential hydrogen bonds, which can further raise the melting point (+28.5). Hence, the combined effect of both functional groups leads to a predicted increase in the melting point.",
