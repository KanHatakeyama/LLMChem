        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 1-nitronaphthalene, we need to consider the effects of the naphthalene basic unit and the nitro functional group. The naphthalene unit, similar to benzene but with an additional fused ring, provides a large pi-electron system, which increases molecular stability and hence increases the melting point compared to benzene. We can consider the base melting point of naphthalene as roughly 80\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and pi-electron interactions. The nitro group is an electron-withdrawing group that forms strong internal dipoles due to its resonance structures, which can lead to an increase in both melting and boiling points due to increased intermolecular forces. For a single nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, an increase of approximately -20\u00b0C from the base naphthalene can be estimated as it introduces rigidity and intermolecular attractions due to its dipoles. However, considering the actual value is lower than base naphthalene, the overall molecular symmetry and packing may be disrupted by the nitro group, resulting in a decrease in melting point.",
