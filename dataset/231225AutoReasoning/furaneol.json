        "Reason": "The compound furaneol consists of a furan ring, which is the basic unit and is derived from furan with a melting point of -85.6. The functional groups present in furaneol are: a methyl group, a secondary alcohol group, and an aldehyde group. Each of these groups affects the melting point differently: \n- Methyl group: This generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and surface area. Increment can be estimated to be around +10 to +20 for each methyl group. However, since there is a net +2 interaction from two methyl groups, we can estimate +20 in total. \n- Secondary alcohol group: Hydroxyl groups can participate in hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. The increment could be estimated to be around +50 for the OH group attached to a secondary carbon. \n- Aldehyde group: Like hydroxyl groups, the aldehyde can engage in hydrogen bonding. The aldehyde group likely contributes similarly to the alcohol but may slightly hinder the packing efficiency due to its steric nature compared to a simple hydroxyl. Therefore, we can add +40 for the aldehyde group. Combining these effects, the net increase is expected to be around +110 when compared to furan. Thus, we predict the melting point of furaneol to be -85.6 (furan) + 110 = 24.4\u00b0C, which clearly is an incorrect prediction compared to the actual value.",
