        "Reason": "The compound 3,3,3-trifluoro-N-(4-methylphenyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide has several functionalities that affect its melting point. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the amide group generally increases the melting point due to its ability to engage in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, typically adding +80\u00b0C. Each trifluoromethyl group is both electron-withdrawing and highly polar, which should lead to a considerable elevation in melting point. For each trifluoromethyl group, let\u2019s conservatively estimate an increase of +30\u00b0C due to enhanced polarity and van der Waals interactions. The methyl group attached to the phenyl ring adds both bulk and weakens polarity slightly, which might raise the melting point slightly, estimating +5\u00b0C.",
