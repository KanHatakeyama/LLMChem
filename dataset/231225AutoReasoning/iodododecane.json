        "Reason": "Beginning with the base structure of dodecane, which is a straight-chain alkane with 12 carbon atoms, we can predict the melting point by considering its functional groups. Dodecane has a melting point of -9.6 degrees Celsius.\n\nAdding an iodine atom to form 1-iodododecane significantly increases the molecular weight and introduces stronger intermolecular forces (van der Waals interactions) due to the larger electron cloud associated with iodine. Iodine also slightly increases the polarity of the molecule. These factors typically raise the melting point. \n\nHowever, 1-iodododecane remains a relatively non-polar molecule overall, as alkanes generally have low melting points owing to weak van der Waals forces. The addition of an iodine atom can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 20 degrees Celsius, based on comparisons with similar compounds.\n",
