        "Reason": "The compound (1S,4S)-2-boc-2,5-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has several functional groups, such as the tertiary butyl group (t-Bu), the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group, and the diazabicycloalkane structure. The basic bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has a strained ring system, which tends to increase the melting point relative to a similar acyclic compound due to the ring strain and symmetry. However, nitrogen atoms incorporated in the rings generally reduce the melting point compared to carbocycles because of the lower intermolecular forces relative to carbon-only rings. The Boc group, being bulky, increases sterical hindrance and slightly lowers the melting point due to the less efficient packing. Nonetheless, the t-Bu group, a large non-polar group, contributes to an increase in the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions compared to smaller alkyl groups. Considering these factors, the prediction is made as follows: Basic bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure: +30 (higher than acyclic due to strain), incorporation of N atoms: -10 (lower than carbocycles), Boc group: -5 (steric hindrance), t-Bu group: +10 (larger alkyl group).",
        "Prediction": "Base bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure: 30, incorporation of N atoms: -10, Boc group: -5, t-Bu group: +10; Total effect: 30 - 10 - 5 + 10 = 25; Basic bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane estimated melting point: 50 (estimated), Adjusted for functional groups: 50 + 25 = 75",
