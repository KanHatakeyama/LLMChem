        "Reason": "The basic unit for allylamine is ammonia (NH3), which has a melting point of -77.73\u00b0C. The alkene group generally raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for van der Waals interactions. For each carbon added in an alkane, the melting point increases by about 20 to 30\u00b0C, but alkenes have lower effects due to less effective van der Waals interactions than alkanes. Here, however, because of conjugation, we expect a diminished increase. Based on this, we can estimate the vinyl group (C=C) may increase the melting point by around +10\u00b0C. The additional methyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) contributes with a smaller increase, let's say around +2\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, ammonia (NH3), has a melting point of -77.73\u00b0C. The alkene group, called a vinyl group when attached to another functional group, tends to have less impact on the melting point than alkanes. We expect this effect to be weakened due to the presence of the double bond's pi electrons which may reduce the van der Waals interactions compared to saturated carbons. However, the molecule also contains an allyl moiety, which introduces molecular rigidity and could potentially raise the melting point slightly. Additionally, the added molecular weight from the two carbon atoms in the allyl group could increase the melting point by about 2-3\u00b0C for each carbon due to van der Waals interactions. The amino group in its primary state does not significantly affect the melting point relative to the base molecule of ammonia. Let's consider a modest increase of approximately +5\u00b0C for the entire allyl group's effect.",

Each of the following functional group modifications will alter this base melting point. - Alkenyl group (propenyl in this case): -10 degrees Celsius because it provides molecular rigidity but also slightly increases the molecular size, which may reduce the melting point somewhat. - Amine group: the amine is already counted in the base unit (ammonia). No additional modifications needed for the amine group in this case.",
