        "Reason": "To understand the predicted melting point of 4-methoxybenzonitrile, we will start with the base molecule benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of functional groups to this base structure can lead to increases or decreases in the melting point depending on the nature of the interactions these groups introduce. A methoxy group (-OCH3) is generally expected to raise the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding via the oxygen atom; however, its electron-donating nature and the steric hindrance it introduces can counter the effect of potential hydrogen bonding, particularly when attached to a large aromatic system. Therefore, we will estimate the effect of the methoxy group as +5\u00b0C. The nitrile group (-C#N) is highly electronegative and introduces a dipole moment, which can lead to stronger intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole attractions, raising the melting point. We will estimate the effect of the nitrile group as +15\u00b0C due to these stronger interactions. The overall predicted melting point is the sum of the effects of the individual functional groups added to the base value of benzene.",
