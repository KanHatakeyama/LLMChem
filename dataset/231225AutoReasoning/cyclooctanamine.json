        "Reason": "Starting from cyclooctane as a base structure with an estimated melting point somewhat below room temperature. Introducing an amine group to form cyclooctanamine increases the melting point due to potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. For amines, we might estimate an increase of around 40-50 degrees Celsius, but since the base structure is a flexible ring that does not pack efficiently in the solid state, the increase might not be as high. We will estimate a moderate increase of 30 degrees for the amine group. If we assumed cyclooctane had a melting point around -20 degrees Celsius, the overall prediction would thus be about 10 degrees Celsius for cyclooctanamine.",

        "Reason": "Starting from cyclooctane, which has a melting point of -57\u00b0C, the addition of an amine group can significantly alter the melting point due to the introduction of hydrogen bonding capabilities. Amines typically can increase the melting point by creating intermolecular hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules; however, the size of the cyclooctane ring and its flexibility may lead to less efficient packing, somewhat mitigating the increase in melting point due to hydrogen bonding. A reasonable estimate for the effect of an amine group on the melting point could be an increase of around 10\u00b0C, considering the balance between increased hydrogen bonding and the less efficient packing of the larger, flexible ring. Therefore, adding this to the cyclooctane base gives us a prediction.",
