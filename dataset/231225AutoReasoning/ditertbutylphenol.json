        "Reason": "The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of approximately 41\u00b0C. tert-Butyl groups are bulky and tend to increase the melting point of a compound by hindering close packing of molecules in the solid state; however, they also create steric hindrance around the phenol hydroxyl group which disrupts hydrogen bonding. Each tert-butyl group may increase the melting point by around +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and bulk, but the steric hindrance could offset this effect. With two tert-butyl groups, the collective influence might be an increase of about +10\u00b0C. However, considering the disruptions to close packing and hydrogen bonding, an overall decrease in melting point is expected compared to phenol.",
