        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of p-formylacetanilide, we analyze the contributions of its functional groups and structure to its melting point, relative to the base compound acetanilide. Acetanilide has a known melting point of approximately 114 \u00b0C. The p-formyl group (\u2013CHO) is expected to increase the melting point due to enhanced polar interactions and the potential for hydrogen bonding with the nitrogen of the amide group. We can estimate this increase to be around 20-30 \u00b0C. Moreover, the presence of the amide group itself (\u2013CONH\u2013) contributes to both polarity and hydrogen bonding, which are already accounted for in the base acetanilide. There are no additional alkyl chains or other groups that significantly decrease the melting point. Considering these effects, an estimated increase of about 20-30 \u00b0C from the formyl group seems reasonable.",

The formyl group at the para position to the amide contributes to increased hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which typically increases melting point significantly. Furthermore, the fact that this formyl group is at the para position allows for more symmetrical packing in the solid state, potentially stabilizing the crystal lattice and further increasing melting point. It is expected that this group adds around 40-50 \u00b0C due to these effects. No other functional groups that would lower the melting point relative to acetanilide are present.",
