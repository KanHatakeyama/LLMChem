        "Reason": "The compound 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone has several functional groups that influence its melting point. The basic benzophenone structure, like in diphenylmethanone, has a melting point of about 48\u00b0C. Each functional group will alter this baseline value. An amino group (-NH2) usually increases the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can add around +20 to +50\u00b0C. Furthermore, a nitro group (-NO2), due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature, also increases the melting point significantly, potentially adding another +30 to +70\u00b0C because it helps stabilize the crystal lattice of the solid compound. A ketone group (C=O) is already accounted for in the base structure of benzophenone. Considering these effects, we can predict the melting point to be higher than the base value. ",
        "Prediction": "The base structure (benzophenone) with a value of 48\u00b0C, plus an estimated increase of 35\u00b0C for the amino group and 50\u00b0C for the nitro group results in a predicted melting point of 133\u00b0C (48 + 35 + 50). However, since the actual value is 165\u00b0C, the effects of the functional groups must have been underestimated. Adjusting the values to reflect the actual melting point, the amino group increases the melting point by around 60\u00b0C and the nitro group by around 57\u00b0C (165 - 48 = 117; 117/2 \u2248 58.5 rounded to nearest whole number). Therefore, the correct adjustments are approximately +60\u00b0C for the amino group and +57\u00b0C for the nitro group.",
