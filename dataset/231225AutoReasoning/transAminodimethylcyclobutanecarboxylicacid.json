        "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit cyclobutane, which has a melting point around -90\u00b0C. The introduction of functional groups will modify this value significantly. Each methyl group is expected to increase the melting point due to an increase in Van der Waals forces; let's estimate it at +50\u00b0C for both. The amino group (-NH2) will contribute to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which substantially increases melting point; we will estimate this effect at +110\u00b0C. Finally, the carboxyl group (-COOH) also establishes strong hydrogen bonding, further increasing the melting point; let's estimate this effect at +85\u00b0C. Summing these contributions gives us an estimated overall increase in melting point.",

Each methyl group is expected to raise the melting point, partially due to an increase in van der Waals interactions; let's estimate this effect at +70\u00b0C for both methyl groups together. The amino group (-NH2) contributes to intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which usually results in a significant melting point increase; we will estimate this effect at +100\u00b0C.
