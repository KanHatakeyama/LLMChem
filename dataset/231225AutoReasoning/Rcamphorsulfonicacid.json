        "Reason": "The basic unit for the camphor structure is a bicyclic ketone with a relatively high melting point due to its rigid structure. Estimating the melting point of camphor itself can serve as a starting point, which is around 179\u00b0C. The addition of the sulfonic acid group generally increases the melting point due to the possibility of forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increased polarity. The steric hindrance in the camphor structure is significant, which may inhibit crystal packing to some extent, thereby not maximizing the potential melting point increase as it might in a less hindered structure. We might estimate a positive shift of around 20-30\u00b0C for the introduction of the sulfonic acid group.",
