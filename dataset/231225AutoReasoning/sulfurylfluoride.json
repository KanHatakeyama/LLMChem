        "Reason": "The basic unit for sulfuryl fluoride could be considered as sulfur dioxide, which has a melting point of -72\u00b0C. The presence of two fluorine atoms substituting hydrogen atoms increases molecular weight and electronegativity, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces and a decrease in the melting point. Each fluorine substitution on sulfur dioxide is likely responsible for a decrease in melting point due to increased polarity and molecular volume. Based on similar compounds, an approximate decrease of 32\u00b0C per fluorine atom can be considered.",
