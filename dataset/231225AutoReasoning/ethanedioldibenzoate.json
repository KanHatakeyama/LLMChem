        "Reason": "The compound 1,2-ethanediol, dibenzoate contains several functional groups that influence its melting point. The base structure of the 1,2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol) has a melting point of -13\u00b0C. The introduction of benzoyl groups increases the rigidity of the molecule and significantly raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and possibly some pi-stacking interactions. Each benzene ring contributes positively to the melting point. Esters generally have moderate influence on melting points due to their polarity. Considering these effects, the benzoyl groups could add approximately +30 to +40\u00b0C each to the melting point, and the ethylene glycol part provides a low starting point. Adding the influence of the two benzoyl groups results in a substantial increase in melting point of the compound.",
