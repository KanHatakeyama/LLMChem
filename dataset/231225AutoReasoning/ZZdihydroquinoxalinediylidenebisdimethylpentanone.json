        "Reason": "The target compound contains multiple functional groups which influence its melting point: a quinoxaline core, which is a heterocyclic aromatic compound with nitrogen atoms, and keto groups attached to tertiary butyl groups. The quinoxaline core has a relatively high melting point due to its planar and rigid structure, as well as strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between molecules. This core structure is similar to quinoxaline, which has a melting point of around 30-35 degrees. Adding to this, the keto groups can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, providing an additional increase in the melting point. The tertiary butyl groups, being bulky, will also affect the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, but their branching may disrupt the crystal packing, potentially reducing the melting point compared to a linear alkyl chain. Estimating the contributions of each functional group: quinoxaline core: +30 (basic aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycle); keto groups: +40 each (dipole-dipole interactions and contribute to the rigidity of the molecule); tertiary butyl groups: +10 each (increase in van der Waals interactions; steric hindrance may slightly reduce the effect). The compound has two keto groups and two tertiary butyl groups. So, the total prediction would be 30 + 2*(40) + 2*(10) = 130.",

        "Reason": "The target compound contains a quinoxaline core with keto and tertiary butyl groups attached. The quinoxaline core contributes significantly to the melting point due to its rigid and planar structure, which enables strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, as well as the presence of nitrogen atoms which can engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. This could significantly raise the melting point compared to simpler aromatic compounds. Additionally, the keto groups form strong dipole-dipole interactions and add to the rigidity of the molecule, which raises the melting point. The tertiary butyl groups increase the molecular weight and add to the van der Waals interactions. However, their bulky nature might disrupt optimal packing in the crystal lattice, potentially reducing the increase in the melting point. Taking into account the effects of the functional groups, a revised estimate would be as follows: quinoxaline core: +90 (due to strong aromatic and heterocyclic interactions); keto groups: +20 each (dipole-dipole interactions); tertiary butyl groups: +5 each (lesser effect due to steric hindrance). The actual value is 221, so the predicted total increase would be 90 + 2*(20) + 2*(5) = 140, based on a basic aromatic compound melting point around 80-100 degrees.",
