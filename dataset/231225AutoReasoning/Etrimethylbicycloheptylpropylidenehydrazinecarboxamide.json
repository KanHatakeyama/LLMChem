        "Reason": "The basic unit for predicting the melting point of the target compound is a simple hydrocarbon such as butane, which has a melting point around -138.4. The various functional groups and structural features in this compound all contribute to raising the melting point above this baseline. The bicyclic structure (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) typically increases the melting point significantly due to rigidity and a high degree of symmetry, which we can approximate as raising the melting point by approximately +150. The presence of a carboxamide group serves to increase the melting point through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, adding roughly another +70. Three methyl groups add steric bulk and make the molecule more spherical, increasing the melting point further; each can contribute around +5. Additionally, presence of the hydrazine moiety would also elevate the melting point due to potential for hydrogen bonding, adding an estimated +10. Thus, the calculation is: -138.4 (butane baseline) + 150 (bicyclic structure) + 70 (carboxamide) + 15 (three methyl groups) + 10 (hydrazine moiety).",

        "Reason": "The base structure for predicting the melting point of the compound is butane, which has a melting point of -138.4\u00b0C. First, the bicyclic structure (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) adds a significant amount of rigidity and intermolecular interactions due to its symmetry and saturated nature, which can raise the melting point substantially, estimated at +250\u00b0C. The presence of a carboxamide group enhances the melting point through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, adding approximately +80\u00b0C. Each of the three methyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which can be estimated at +5\u00b0C each, totalling +15\u00b0C. The hydrazine moiety contributes additional sites for hydrogen bonding, further elevating the melting point by around +15\u00b0C. Adding these adjustments to the butane baseline gives us a predicted melting point of -138.4 + 250 + 80 + 15 + 15 = 221.6\u00b0C.",
