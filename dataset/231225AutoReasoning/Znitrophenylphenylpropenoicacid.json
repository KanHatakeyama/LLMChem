        "Reason": "The base unit for comparison will be benzoic acid, with a melting point of 122.4 degrees Celsius. The presence of a phenyl group increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the possibility of \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, which might contribute an estimated +30 degrees. The presence of the nitro group on the other phenyl ring provides strong inductive electron withdrawal, increasing intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding (if available) and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +40 degrees. The presence of the double bond in the aliphatic chain (prop-2-enoic acid) does not significantly affect the melting point, as it neither increases hydrogen bonding nor presents significant steric hindrance in solid-state packing.",
