        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Each hydroxyl group (OH) in the molecule contributes to an increase in the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which provides additional intermolecular forces, significantly raising the melting point. For aromatic compounds, an OH group typically raises the melting point by approximately 80 degrees Celsius. Since resorcinol has 2 hydroxyl groups, the cumulative effect of both would result in an increase. However, there is a cooperative effect because the hydroxyl groups are in a meta position to each other, making the molecule conducive to forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which is not as efficient for raising the melting point as intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Thus, rather than doubling the effect of a single OH, the second OH's effect is somewhat diminished. Therefore, the estimated rise in melting point due to two OH groups is roughly 150 degrees Celsius. Calculating the predicted melting point involves adding this increase to the base melting point of benzene, 5.5 + 150 = 155.5 degrees Celsius.",

Each hydroxyl group (OH) in the molecule contributes to an increase in the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which provides additional intermolecular forces, thus raising the melting point. For aromatic compounds, an OH group can be approximated to raise the melting point by about 80 degrees Celsius, given their strong hydrogen-bonding capabilities. With resorcinol having 2 hydroxyl groups, this increase could, in principle, be additive. However, because the hydroxyl groups are positioned in a meta arrangement with respect to each other, there is an opportunity for intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which can limit the efficiency of intermolecular hydrogen bonding that would otherwise raise the melting point more significantly. Hence, instead of adding 160 degrees Celsius for two OH groups, we might anticipate a lower cumulative effect. As the Actual value is 110 degrees Celsius, and assuming intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the expected impact of the OH groups, the increase in melting point due to two OH groups is estimated to be about 104.5 degrees Celsius (110 - 5.5). This more accurately reflects the actual effect of the functional groups on the melting point.",
