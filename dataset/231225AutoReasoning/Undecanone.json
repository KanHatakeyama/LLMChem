        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is decane, which has a melting point of -30 degrees Celsius. The presence of a ketone (C=O) group in undecan-2-one generally increases the melting point due to the polar nature of the carbonyl group and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions. A ketone group in a molecule similar to undecan-2-one might typically add approximately +40 degrees Celsius to the melting point because of these interactions. Therefore, the overall predicted increase for undecan-2-one is due to an additional methylene group (+5 due to increased molecular weight and chain length) and the polar ketone functionality (+40).",
