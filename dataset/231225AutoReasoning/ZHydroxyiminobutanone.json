The modifications from acetone are: 1) an additional methyl group, which generally increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, let's estimate this as +10; 2) introduction of a (Z)-hydroxyimino group replacing a hydrogen, which significantly increases the melting point due to potential for hydrogen bonding and the rigid structure provided by the double bond, estimated increase is +160. These effects are additive, leading to an overall estimated increase.",

The changes leading to the target compound include: 1) an additional methyl group, which generally increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, and for this case, we estimate this as a +10 increase. 2) The introduction of a (Z)-hydroxyimino group in place of a hydrogen, which increases the melting point significantly due to the capacity for hydrogen bonding and the structural rigidity conferred by the double bond. This group can contribute a substantial increase; for the purpose of this prediction, we estimate it to be a +160 increase. These two effects are additive, leading to the combined estimated increase.",
