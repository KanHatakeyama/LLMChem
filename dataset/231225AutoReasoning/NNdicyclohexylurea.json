        "Reason": "The target compound, N,N'-dicyclohexylurea, consists of several functional groups whose contributions to the melting point can be considered. First, the basic unit urea has a melting point of 133\u00b0C. The addition of two cyclohexyl groups increases molecular weight and van der Waals forces. For each cyclohexyl, we can estimate a contribution of +45 to the melting point due to the increase in surface area and molecular interactions. The amide linkage to each cyclohexyl group adds rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which might contribute an additional +5. Therefore, we have 133 (urea base) + 2*(45 for each cyclohexyl) + 2*(5 for each amide linkage) in our prediction.",
        "Prediction": "133 (for urea) + 90 (for two cyclohexyl groups) + 10 (for two amide linkages) = 233\u00b0C",
