        "Reason": "The parent compound, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid functional group (COOH) introduced into benzene to form benzoic acid increases the melting point significantly due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and the increase in molecular weight. The hydrogen bonding potential of the carboxylic acid group is due to its ability to both donate and accept hydrogen bonds, leading to dimerization in the solid state that requires more energy to break apart. Additionally, the increased polarity from the carboxyl group also enhances intermolecular forces. It's reasonable to add approximately 116.5 to the basic unit because of the presence of the carboxyl group and considering its strong effect on the melting point.",
