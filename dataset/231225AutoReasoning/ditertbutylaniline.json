        "Reason": "The basic unit, aniline, has a boiling point of approximately 184\u00b0C. Each tert-butyl group attached to the benzene ring adds steric hindrance and bulkiness, which tends to increase the melting point, however, the large amount of branching in tert-butyl groups may provide significant steric hindrance that can interfere with the crystal lattice packing, thereby reducing the melting point. Aniline also has hydrogen bonding from the amine group, which contributes to a higher melting point, but the introduction of bulky tert-butyl groups can inhibit effective intermolecular hydrogen bonding due to steric hindrance, thus lowering the melting point. As there are two tert-butyl groups and their effect of steric hindrance is stronger than the simple addition of alkyl groups, their net effect would be significant but not simply additive. An estimate of the change due to each tert-butyl group might be around -15\u00b0C for the melting point, based on the disruption they cause to crystal packing. The overall prediction needs to balance the increased melting point due to the molecular weight and bulkiness of tert-butyl groups with the decreased melting point due to the disrupted packing and weakened hydrogen bonding.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, aniline, has a melting point of approximately \u22126\u00b0C. Each tert-butyl group typically contributes to an increase in the melting point owing to the increase in van der Waals forces due to the larger molecular size. However, steric hindrance can disrupt the orderliness in a crystal lattice, potentially reducing the melting point. The tert-butyl groups, being highly branched, may disrupt the efficient packing of molecules in the solid phase. Considering the compound has two tert-butyl groups, and each may decrease the melting point, it's reasonable to estimate a decrease of about 20\u00b0C for each tert-butyl group due to steric hindrance. Aniline's amino group would normally increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, but the bulky tert-butyl groups could shield this interaction, reducing the melting point influence from hydrogen bonding. Since aniline has a melting point of \u22126\u00b0C, the addition of two tert-butyl groups would likely decrease the melting point further.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit we consider here is aniline, which has a melting point of around -6\u00b0C. The addition of tert-butyl groups to the benzene ring increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the steric hindrance which lessens molecular packing efficiency. The electron-donating effect of the tert-butyl groups also makes the ring slightly more electron-rich, but this electronic effect is less significant for melting points compared to boiling points. tert-Butyl groups are known to increase melting points significantly, often by 20-30\u00b0 per group due to steric effects. As there are two tert-butyl groups in the target compound, we can estimate the increase.",
