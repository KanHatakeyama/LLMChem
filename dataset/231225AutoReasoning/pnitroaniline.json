        "Reason": "The basic unit here is aniline which has a melting point of approximately 6 degrees Celsius. The p-nitro group is an electron-withdrawing group through resonance and induction, which would increase intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions because it pulls the electron density away from the aniline's amino group, thus making the molecule more polar. This increased polarity should raise the melting point. The contribution of the p-nitro group might be estimated at around +100 to +150 degrees Celsius due to its strong electron-withdrawing effect and the resultant increase in intermolecular forces.",
        "Prediction": "The basic unit, aniline has a melting point of 6 degrees Celsius. Adding the effect of the p-nitro group: +100 to +150 = 106 to 156 degrees Celsius.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, aniline, has a melting point of approximately 6 degrees Celsius. The presence of a p-nitro group significantly enhances the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing character, which increases the molecule's polarity. This polarity strengthens intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. I estimate that the p-nitro group's contribution to the melting point is around +144 degrees Celsius, considering the known substantial effect electron-withdrawing groups have on melting points.",
