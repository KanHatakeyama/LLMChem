        "Reason": "The target compound is 1,2,3-tribromobutane. The basic unit butane has a melting point of -138.4 degrees Celsius. Each bromo group increases the melting point, primarily due to a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, as well as potential for dipole-dipole interactions between molecules. Since the molecule contains three bromine atoms, each contributing to the increase in melting point, we will estimate the contribution of each bromo group. Estimating a +40 degree Celsius increase per bromo group gives a total increase of +120 degrees Celsius.",
