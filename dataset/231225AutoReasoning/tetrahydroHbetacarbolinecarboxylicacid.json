        "Reason": "Starting with indole, which has a melting point around 52\u00b0C, we add the effects of other structural features. The carboxylic acid group typically raises the melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds; this can contribute around +150\u00b0C to the melting point. The cyclic structure in the tetrohydro moiety with the nitrogen introduces ring strain and rigidness, which can contribute around +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the presence of the nitrogen in the ring structure can allow for hydrogen bonding, potentially adding +20\u00b0C. Finally, the saturation of the carboline part adds to a more rigid and less entropic structure, contributing to an increase of around +30\u00b0C.",
