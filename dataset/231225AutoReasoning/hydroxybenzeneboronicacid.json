        "Reason": "The basic unit for 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The influence of the functional groups involved in 3-hydroxybenzeneboronic acid will shift the melting point relative to this base value. Firstly, the hydroxyl group (-OH) significantly increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities; this effect can be approximated to a +100\u00b0C increase. Next, the boronic acid group (B(OH)2) further increases the melting point for similar reasons \u2013 hydrogen bonding and increased molecular complexity; the boronic acid group can be associated with an increase of about +70\u00b0C. Finally, there's a slight increase because of the additional phenolic OH, which we can estimate at +30\u00b0C. Combining these effects, we can predict a substantial net increase from the base value of benzene. It should be noted that these values are approximations and the actual shifts can vary based on molecular context.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (benzene) + 100 (phenolic OH) + 70 (boronic acid group) + 30 (additional phenolic OH) = 205.5\u00b0C",
