        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine has a melting point of -42 degrees Celsius. Bromine is a large, heavy atom which when substituted onto pyridine, significantly increases both the molecular weight and the melting point. Each bromine is expected to raise the melting point substantially due to added intermolecular London dispersion forces. For similar bromine-substituted aromatics, a single bromine can raise the melting point by approximately 70-80 degrees Celsius. With two bromine atoms, the combined effect will be less than double that of a single bromine due to steric hindrance and electronic effects that can limit further molecular packing efficiency.",
