        "Reason": "The basic unit indole has a melting point of around 52\u00b0C. Adding a methyl group generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and size, which can be approximated at +15\u00b0C. The presence of an aldehyde group can influence the melting point by its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. An aldehyde group typically has a raising effect on the melting point, potentially by +30\u00b0C. Considering indole as the base unit with adjustments for the additional functional groups, the individual contributions are added to the base melting point of indole.",

        "Reason": "The base compound indole has a melting point of around 52\u00b0C. The addition of a methyl group to the molecule usually increases the melting point due to the increase in van der Waals interactions from the slightly larger molecular size and surface area, which can contribute approximately +15\u00b0C. However, the introduction of the aldehyde group can have a more substantial effect on the melting point. Aldehyde groups can form hydrogen bonds and engage in stronger dipole-dipole interactions due to their carbonyl functional group. This can significantly increase the melting point, which might be estimated as a +100-120\u00b0C contribution. The predicted melting point should reflect the cumulative effects of both the methyl and aldehyde functional groups added to the base structure of indole.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit to consider here is indole, which has a melting point around 52 \u00b0C. Adding a methyl group typically raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals forces, this might increase the value by about 20 \u00b0C. An aldehyde group tends to increase the melting point because it can form hydrogen bonds and has a polar character, potentially adding up to 40 \u00b0C. Overall, the combination of these functional groups and the rigid structure of the aromatic rings in the indole core will result in significant intermolecular interactions, thus raising the melting point considerably.",

The addition of an aldehyde group can substantially raise the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and its polar nature, potentially raising the melting point by about 120 \u00b0C.
