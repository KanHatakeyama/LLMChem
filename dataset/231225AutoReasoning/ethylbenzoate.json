        "Reason": "The compound ethyl benzoate consists of an ester functional group and a phenyl ring. The ester group tends to decrease the melting point when compared to the benzene because of the polarity and the possibility of forming a more disordered solid structure. Benzene has a melting point of 5.5. An ethyl group does not significantly increase the melting point much due to its linear structure and hydrophobic nature, thus its effect could be estimated at +1. The ester functional group, however, causes a significant drop in the melting point by around -40 compared to benzene, due to its contribution to a less orderly solid and offering less opportunity for intermolecular hydrogen bonding.",
