        "Reason": "The base compound, naphthalene, has a melting point of 80.5\u00b0C. The presence of a hydroxyl (OH) group generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen-bonding, which could add roughly +40 to the value. However, the addition of a methyl group tends to decrease the melting point slightly due to the increase in molecular volume and reduction in symmetry, which can disrupt the crystal lattice, having possibly a -5 effect. The combined effects of hydroxyl and methyl groups on naphthalene should result in a moderate increase in the melting point.",

The addition of a hydroxyl (OH) group generally increases the melting point because of hydrogen bonding capabilities, which could add approximately +20. However, the addition of a methyl group tends to decrease the melting point due to an increase in molecular volume and a reduction in symmetry, which can disrupt the crystal lattice; this could have an effect around -5.
