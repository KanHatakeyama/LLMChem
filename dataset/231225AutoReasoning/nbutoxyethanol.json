        "Reason": "The compound 2-n-butoxyethanol is comprised of an ethylene glycol unit and a butyl ether unit. The ethylene glycol unit has a melting point around -13\u00b0C. The added butyl group introduces van der Waals forces and makes the compound larger, which would typically make the melting point higher. However, the ether linkage decreases the possible hydrogen-bonding interactions compared to a straight-chain alcohol with a molecular weight similar to that of 2-n-butoxyethanol. We'll assign a +4\u00b0C increase for the butyl group's van der Waals interactions, and a -70\u00b0C decrease due to the weakened hydrogen-bonding capacity and increased conformational flexibility from the ether linkage.",
