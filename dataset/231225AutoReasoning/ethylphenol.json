        "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by several factors including molecular weight, symmetry, and types of intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and London dispersion forces. Starting with phenol, which has a melting point of 41 degrees Celsius, we consider the effects of substituents. An ethyl group generally increases the molecular weight and provides more surface area for London dispersion forces, which could increase the melting point. However, the ethyl group may also disrupt the symmetry of the molecule to a minor extent and reduce the melting point. Considering these competing effects, an ethyl group can be estimated to raise the melting point by 5 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the net change due to the ethyl group is an increase.",
