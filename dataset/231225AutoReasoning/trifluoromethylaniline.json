        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group is an electron-withdrawing group due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine atoms and slightly lowers the melting point because it weakens the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between benzene rings, causing less effective packing (-5). The amino group is a mild electron-donating group and tends to form hydrogen bonds, which increases the melting point (+10). The effects of the two functional groups partially counteract each other.",
