        "Reason": "The molecule diethyl formamidomalonate contains several functional groups that influence its melting point. The ester groups (\u2013COOC2H5) generally increase melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions relative to alkanes, but the presence of ethyl groups (\u2013C2H5) which are alkyl chains tends to lower the melting point by providing flexibility and lowering symmetrical packing potential. The amide group (\u2013CONH\u2013) significantly raises the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance stability of the amide bond. Additionally, the presence of two more carbonyl groups (C=O), one part of the amide and another part of the malonate, will contribute to a higher melting point due to their polar nature and the possibility for additional intermolecular hydrogen bonding. However, these effects are somewhat negated by the overall large size and flexibility of the molecule, which tends to lower melting point. The combination of these opposing influences results in a moderate melting point.",
