        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of the carboxylic acid group significantly increases the melting point due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds; this effect typically adds about 100-120 degrees Celsius. Each fluorine substituent is expected to contribute approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the electronegativity of fluorine drawing electron density away from the benzene ring, thus strengthening intermolecular attractions. The hydroxy group also increases the melting point through hydrogen bonding, usually adding around +40-50 degrees Celsius. However, since hydroxy and carboxylic acid groups are both capable of hydrogen bonding, their effects can't be simply combined; the overall contribution must be less than the sum of individual effects. Therefore, a conservative estimate would be an additional +30 degrees for the combined effect of these polar, hydrogen-bond-capable groups.",
