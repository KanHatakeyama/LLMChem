        "Reason": "For 2-cyanophenol, we must consider the effects of both the hydroxyl (-OH) group and the nitrile (\u2013C\u2261N) group on the base structure of benzene. The benzene ring has a basic melting point reference, which we will take as around 5.5 \u00b0C for the sake of comparison. The hydroxyl group is known to increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds; this could be estimated as an increase of approximately +70 \u00b0C. On the other hand, the nitrile group, being polar and having a cyano group attached directly to the ring, tends to increase the rigidity of the molecule and might contribute an additional +20 \u00b0C due to dipole-dipole interactions and potential for cyano group stacking. The sum of contributions from each functional group and the base benzene structure will give us the predicted melting point.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (base benzene) + 70 (hydroxyl group) + 20 (nitrile group) = 95.5",
