        "Reason": "The compound 3-carboxybenzaldehyde is based on a benzene ring, which provides a basic unit for the melting point. Benzene itself has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two polar functional groups, namely the carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the aldehyde (-CHO), both contribute to an increase in the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonding significantly increases the intermolecular forces, thus raising the melting point. A carboxylic acid group typically raises the melting point by approximately 40-50\u00b0C due to its dimerization capability and strong hydrogen bonding. An aldehyde group, while less capable of hydrogen bonding than a carboxylic acid, can still raise the melting point by about 20-30\u00b0C because it can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor. Additionally, the para position of the substituents may provide a more symmetrical structure, also favoring a higher melting point.",

        "Reason": "The compound 3-carboxybenzaldehyde has a basic benzene ring, which serves as the starting point for estimating the melting point. Benzene by itself has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aldehyde group (-CHO), both of which are capable of hydrogen bonding. The carboxylic acid group can form strong intermolecular dimer connections and increase the melting point by approximately 50\u00b0C. The aldehyde group is also able to participate in hydrogen bonding, though to a lesser extent, and can increase the melting point by around 30\u00b0C. These additive effects result from the increased intermolecular forces due to hydrogen bonding. The presence of these polar groups also makes the molecule more rigid, which can contribute to a higher melting point. Additionally, the geometric arrangement of the substituents in the para position could lead to a more symmetrical and tightly packable structure, promoting crystal lattice stability. All these factors combined account for the increased melting point compared to benzene.",

        "Reason": "The base molecule for this compound can be considered to be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The added functional groups - an aldehyde (\u2013CHO) and a carboxylic acid (\u2013COOH) will influence this. Typically, aldehyde groups can increase the melting point slightly because they can participate in dipole-dipole interactions but do not provide as strong of an effect as more polar or hydrogen-bonding capable groups. For a rough estimate, let's say it contributes +10 degrees Celsius. Carboxylic acid groups, however, have a significant impact on the melting point due to their ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This effect can be substantial, so we can estimate a much larger increase, such as +160 degrees Celsius. Combining these effects and considering the incremental increase due to added molecular weight and van der Waals forces, we get an estimated melting point increase.",
