        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of p-nitrophenyl acetate, we consider the effects of the different functional groups compared to a reference compound, benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The acetyl group (COCH3) typically raises the melting point due to the increasing molecular weight and the ability to form dipoles, approximated as +20. The nitro group is an electron-withdrawing group and can increase intermolecular attractions due to its potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules, adding approximately +50. However, being para-substituted and considering steric hindrance, the increase might be slightly less, so we adjust this to +45. The presence of the ester linkage (\u2013OCO\u2013) can increase the polarity of the molecule and its potential for dipole-dipole interactions, adding about +7. Combining these adjustments, we sum the effects: benzene's melting point (5.5) + acetyl effect (+20) + nitro effect (+45) + ester linkage effect (+7).",
