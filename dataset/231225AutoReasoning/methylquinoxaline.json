        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is quinoxaline which has a reported melting point of 27-28\u00b0C. The addition of a methyl group to the quinnoxaline (at position 5) causes a small change to the melting point. This can have either a slight stabilizing effect due to an increase in van der Waals forces, or a destabilizing effect due to steric hindrance. However, considering the location of the methyl group at the periphery of the molecule, the change in melting point should not be drastic. The methyl group is relatively small and unlikely to cause significant destabilization, so a decrease in melting point is expected, but it will be modest. We can predict the effect to be in the range of -6 to -8\u00b0C.",
