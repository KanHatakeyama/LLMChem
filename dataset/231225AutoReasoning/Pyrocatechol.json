The presence of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the benzene ring, as in pyrocatechol, significantly affects the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding. Each hydroxyl group raises the melting point approximately by 50 degrees Celsius. Hence, the combined hydroxyl group contribution is around 100 degrees Celsius.",

The presence of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the benzene ring, as in pyrocatechol, significantly affects the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding. However, a 50 degrees Celsius increase for each hydroxyl group seems excessive. Typically, a hydroxyl group can be expected to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, but the effect should be evaluated more conservatively. A range of 20-30 degrees Celsius increase per hydroxyl group is more reasonable. Thus, the combined contribution of two hydroxyl groups would be approximately 40-60 degrees Celsius.",
