        "Reason": "The basic unit of benzene has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Benzopinacol possesses four phenyl groups, which would significantly increase its molecular weight and intermolecular van der Waals forces, hence raising its melting point. Each phenyl group could contribute around +35 \u00b0C based on the increase seen in similar bulky compounds (basic estimation since the exact contribution can vary depending on the molecule's overall structure). Additionally, the two tertiary alcohol groups would further increase the melting point due to the ability for hydrogen bonding, which usually adds significant melting point increases; we can estimate each tertiary alcohol group to contribute about +20 \u00b0C.",
