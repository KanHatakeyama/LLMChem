        "Reason": "The structure of 4-cyanobenzaldehyde can be broken down into a benzene ring as the base unit, an aldehyde functional group (-CHO), and a cyano group (-C#N). Each of these functional groups impacts the melting point of the compound. The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a polar aldehyde group is likely to increase intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding with solvent molecules, which would increase the melting point significantly, estimated as +30\u00b0C. The cyano group is strongly polar and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions as well, and is also expected to raise the melting point; this effect is estimated as +25\u00b0C. Furthermore, both substituents on the benzene ring create a more rigid structure, which tends to increase the melting point. However, the steric hindrance is not significant enough to reduce the melting point appreciably due to less effective packing.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point of 4-cyanobenzaldehyde with the additive effects of its functional groups is 5.5 (benzene) + 30 (aldehyde group) + 25 (cyano group) = 60.5\u00b0C",

        "Reason": "The structure of 4-cyanobenzaldehyde includes a benzene ring as a base unit, an aldehyde functional group (-CHO), and a cyano group (-C#N). The basic melting point for benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. The aldehyde group, being polar, can form dipole-dipole interactions and potentially engage in hydrogen bonding, contributing significantly to the increase in melting point. This increase can be estimated at +70\u00b0C. The cyano group is highly polar and can also form strong dipole-dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. The impact of the cyano group can be estimated at +25\u00b0C. Thus, considering the rigid structure that both groups confer to the molecule, which generally elevates the melting point, as well as the strong polar nature of the functional groups which enhance intermolecular interactions, both modifications from the benzene ring are expected to increase the melting point considerably.",
        "Prediction": "Adding the effects of each functional group to the base unit, the predicted melting point is 5.5 (benzene) + 70 (aldehyde group) + 25 (cyano group) = 100.5\u00b0C",
