        "Reason": "The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of approximately 41\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) is an electron-withdrawing group, which enhances the intermolecular forces due to increased dipole moment. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is expected to increase the melting point by about 10\u00b0C. However, the ortho-positioning of the -CF3 group relative to the hydroxyl may cause some steric hindrance, which could reduce the overall increase. Assuming the steric hindrance has a minor influence, the -CF3 group's large inductive effect would be a stronger factor. Consider the increased molecular weight and electronegativity of the fluorine atoms as part of the trifluoromethyl group, which contributes to strong intermolecular forces that elevate the melting point.",
