        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of nitro groups to the benzene ring generally increases the melting point due to the electron-withdrawing nature of these groups, which increases intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding. Each nitro group could add approximately +40 degrees Celsius. However, since the two nitro groups are in the meta position relative to each other, there may be a slight decrease in the cumulative effect compared to if they were ortho or para to each other, due to less effective overlap of the electron-withdrawing effects. Therefore, we might estimate the increase to be slightly less, say +35 degrees per nitro group.",

The addition of nitro groups to the benzene ring increases the melting point because of the electron-withdrawing nature of these groups, which strengthens intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Each nitro group is expected to add approximately +40 degrees Celsius. However, the meta positioning of the nitro groups could make the increase slightly lower due to reduced symmetry and possible steric hindrance, which might slightly disrupt effective intermolecular interactions. To account for this, we can adjust the addition to be around +38 degrees per nitro group.",
