        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-amino-2-methylpropane can be considered as ethane, which has a melting point of -183\u00b0C. Each methyl group adds steric hindrance and slightly increases the melting point due to the added bulk, which can be estimated as +15\u00b0C per additional methyl group on the carbon skeleton. There are two additional methyl groups compared to ethane. The amino group (NH2) can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which usually raises the melting point significantly. However, due to its position and the hindrance from the bulky t-butyl group, its effect is limited in this case, so we predict an increase of around +30\u00b0C for the presence of the amino group.",

Each methyl group adds steric hindrance and slightly increases the melting point. However, since the molecule is t-butyl (tert-butyl) in structure, there are actually two additional carbon atoms when compared to ethane, with one methyl group making it isopropane and another to make it 2-methylpropane. The effect of each methyl group can be conservatively estimated as +15\u00b0C per additional carbon. There are three carbons added (two from the t-butyl and one from the amino substitution), hence the total increase is approximately +45\u00b0C. The amino group contributes to the melting point by facilitating hydrogen bonding. The increase from the amino group can be estimated as +30\u00b0C, taking into account that its effect might be somewhat diminished by the bulky t-butyl group near it. The combined adjustment from both the methyl groups (+45\u00b0C) and the amino group (+30\u00b0C) suggests an increase from the base ethane melting point.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-amino-2-methylpropane can be considered as propane which has a melting point around -188 degrees Celsius. The addition of an amino (NH2) group generally increases the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding, which introduces intermolecular forces that are stronger than the van der Waals forces in alkanes. A methyl group typically raises the melting point slightly due to an increase in molecular weight and surface area, leading to stronger van der Waals forces. However, since there is already significant branching in this compound (two methyl groups present in the molecule), the effect of another methyl may not significantly raise the melting point further, as branching tends to lower the melting point by reducing the efficiency of molecular packing. The balance of these effects must be taken into account.",
