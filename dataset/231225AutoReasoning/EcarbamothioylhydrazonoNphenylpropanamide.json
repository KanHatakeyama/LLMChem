        "Reason": "The compound (2E)-2-(carbamothioylhydrazono)-N-phenylpropanamide contains several functional groups that influence its melting point: a thiourea moiety (S=C(N)NN=), an amide group (C(=O)N), and a phenyl ring (c1ccccc1). The base molecule we can compare to is an amide, which typically has a melting point around 120 degrees Celsius due to strong hydrogen bonding. The thiourea group is similar to an amide, but with sulfur, which has larger atomic size and can form stronger intermolecular forces, thus increasing the melting point by approximately 20-30 degrees. The presence of the phenyl ring contributes to the melting point increase due to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and increased molecular rigidity; let's estimate this effect as a +20 increment. The extra alkene (C=C) linkage does not have as strong of a contribution to melting point as the other groups and might slightly raise the melting point due to increased rigidity; we'll estimate this at +5.",
        "Prediction": "The estimated melting point increase due to the functional groups would then be 120 (amide base) + 25 (thiourea effect) + 20 (phenyl ring) + 5 (alkene linkage) = 170 degrees Celsius.",

        "Reason": "The molecule (2E)-2-(carbamothioylhydrazono)-N-phenylpropanamide consists of an amide link (C(=O)N), a phenyl group (c1ccccc1), a thiourea moiety (S=C(N)NN=), and a hydrazone component (NN=C) attached to an alkene (C=C). Starting with a simple amide which has a general melting point of 120 degrees Celsius due to hydrogen bonding, we introduce the following increments for each functional group: the thiourea moieties are known to have strong intermolecular forces due to the presence of sulfur, similarly to amides they participate in hydrogen bonding but the presence of sulfur typically raises the melting point and we can add approximately +40 to the base value for this moiety. The phenyl group is known to provide rigidity and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions that can increase the melting point; this can be estimated as a +30 increment. The hydrazone formation can additionally increase the melting point due to its ability to form conjugated systems that enhance molecular rigidity, adding another +10. The alkene (-C=C-) group contributes less significantly to the melting point but can also add to the rigidity of the molecule, let's add +2 for the alkene influence. Summing these up, we predict a melting point of 120 (base amide) + 40 (thiourea) + 30 (phenyl) + 10 (hydrazone) + 2 (alkene) = 202 degrees Celsius.",
