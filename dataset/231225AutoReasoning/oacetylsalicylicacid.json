        "Reason": "The target compound, o-acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), is based on a benzene ring. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The o-acetylsalicylic acid molecule has several functional groups contributing to the melting point. The acetyl group (COCH3) introduces rigidity and a possibility for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point by approximately +50 degrees due to the addition of a polar carbonyl group and hydrogen bond acceptor. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can greatly elevate the melting point; this is estimated to contribute an additional +80 degrees. The presence of an ester linkage (OCO) may also contribute to intermolecular interactions, but its effect is smaller than that of the carboxylic acid, adding roughly +10 degrees. Considering that these groups on the ortho position enhance the intermolecular interactions due to spatial proximity, the additive effects lead to the prediction of the melting point.",
