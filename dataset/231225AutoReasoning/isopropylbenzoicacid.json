        "Reason": "The parent structure, benzoic acid, has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius. The addition of the isopropyl group to the aromatic ring generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for van der Waals interactions, however, it also introduces steric hindrance which disrupts the planarity and packing efficiency of the molecules in the solid state. This can slightly lower the melting point compared to unsubstituted benzoic acid. Considering these effects, the isopropyl group's influence will be approximated as a net decrease of about 3 degrees Celsius.",
