The following functional groups affect the melting point:\n- Biphenyl linkage (rigid structure and larger molecular weight): +100\u00b0C\n- Hydroxyl group (-OH): +40\u00b0C. Hydrogen bonding significantly increases melting point.\n- Amino group (-NH2): +30\u00b0C. Hydrogen bonding and increased polarity contribute to a higher melting point.\n- The combined effect of functional groups, their interactions, and the molecular structure must be summarized to make a prediction.",

        "Reason": "The target compound (1,1'-biphenyl)-4-ol, 3-amino- has a biphenyl core, which is essentially two benzene rings linked together. This structure is considerably more rigid and possesses greater molecular weight compared to a single benzene ring, leading to a significantly higher melting point. The basic benzene melting point is 5.5\u00b0C, which needs to be adjusted for the additional functional groups. The aromatic biphenyl linkage increases melting point through enhanced \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and increased molecular weight: +100\u00b0C is a reasonable estimate for this factor. The hydroxyl group contributes to an increased melting point via strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding: +40\u00b0C for this effect considers both the increased polarity and the potential for extensive hydrogen bonding networks. The amino group introduces another site for hydrogen bonding and increases the polarity of the molecule: +30\u00b0C accounts for these effects. Adding these adjustments to the base melting point of benzene gives a predicted value.",
