        "Reason": "The basic unit, cyclobutane has a melting point of -90.9 degrees Celsius. An amine functional group generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding. A primary amine has two hydrogens that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which we can estimate to contribute an increase of approximately +45 degrees Celsius each. However, as a primary aliphatic amine attached to a small ring, the effect might be slightly less significant due to steric hindrance somewhat limiting hydrogen bonding efficiency, so we'll estimate an increase of +40 degrees Celsius for each hydrogen.",
        "Prediction": "-90.9 (cyclobutane) + 40 (1st hydrogen bond possibility) + 40 (2nd hydrogen bond possibility) = -10.9 degrees Celsius",
        "Prediction(integer)": -10.0
