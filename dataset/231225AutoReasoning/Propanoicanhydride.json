        "Reason": "The basic units to consider for propanoic anhydride would be two propanoic acid molecules, which would come together to form the anhydride. The melting point of propanoic acid is -20.8 \u00b0C. We need to consider the impact of removing two hydroxyl (OH) groups and forming an anhydride linkage. Removal of each hydroxyl group would likely decrease the melting point because hydrogen bonding is reduced (-10 \u00b0C for each OH group). The anhydride linkage itself might slightly elevate the melting point due to increased rigidity of the molecule (+5 \u00b0C). So the overall effect would be the sum of decrease due to OH removal and a slight increase due to anhydride linkage formation.",
