        "Reason": "The basic unit, methane, has a melting point of -182.5 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene (CH2) group in a chain typically raises the melting point by about 20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in van der Waals forces as the molecular weight and surface area increase. However, the presence of an amino (NH2) group tends to lower the melting point since it introduces polarity and hydrogen bonding to the molecule, which can cause a compound to be liquid at a lower temperature, and we'll estimate this effect at about -50 degrees Celsius. 1-Hexylamine has a hexyl chain (5 additional CH2 groups from the base methane) and an amino group. Therefore, the increase in melting point due to the CH2 groups is 5(CH2) * 20 = +100 degrees Celsius, and the lowering due to the amino group is -50 degrees Celsius. The sum of these modifications equals +50 degrees Celsius when applied to methane's melting point.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, methane, has a melting point of -182.5 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene (CH2) group in a chain typically raises the melting point by about 5 degrees Celsius due to the increase in van der Waals forces as the molecular weight and surface area increase. However, the presence of an amino (NH2) group introduces polarity and hydrogen bonding, which usually increases the melting point, contrary to the suggestion that it would lower it. For primary amines, this enhancement is due to stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds. We will estimate this elevation to be approximately +5 degrees Celsius for the amino group in this particular case. 1-Hexylamine has a hexyl chain (5 additional CH2 groups from the base methane) and an amino group. Therefore, the increase in melting point due to the CH2 groups is 5(CH2) * 5 = +25 degrees Celsius, and the elevation due to the amino group is +5 degrees Celsius.

        "Reason": "The basic unit for 1-hexylamine is methane, which has a melting point of -182.5 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene (CH2) group in a linear alkane increases the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. For a linear alkane, the incremental increase is approximately +2 degrees Celsius per CH2 group. Therefore, adding five methylene groups to methane would result in an increase of +10 degrees Celsius. The amino (NH2) group is polar and can engage in hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point. The presence of an NH2 group can increase the melting point by an estimated +20 degrees Celsius compared to the equivalent alkane. Hence, adding these effects together, we get an adjustment of +30 degrees Celsius over the melting point of methane.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is methane, which has a melting point of -182\u00b0C. For each additional -CH2- group in an alkane chain, the melting point generally increases due to the increased van der Waals interactions. For a hexyl group, there are five additional -CH2- units, which could each add approximately 20\u00b0C. However, the presence of an amine (NH2) group at the end of the chain adds polarity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point substantially more than a non-polar carbon chain would. Estimating the effect of an NH2 group on the melting point is more challenging, but it might add around 100\u00b0C to the melting point, considering a similar analog, ethylamine, with a melting point of -81\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than ethane with a melting point of -183\u00b0C.",

Nonetheless, as 1-hexylamine is actually a primary amine with a longer alkyl chain which also decreases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and surface area, the predicted value is adjusted slightly down from this estimate. Therefore, a re-estimation would be -182 + (5 * 20) + 75 for the NH2 = -182 + 100 + 75 = -7\u00b0C.",
