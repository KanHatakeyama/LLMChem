        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be chosen as cyclohexane, which has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. However, the molecular structure of camphanic acid includes several modifications that would significantly increase its melting point: (1) The introduction of a carboxylic acid group can raise the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and an increase in polarity. We can estimate this effect to be around +150 degrees because carboxylic acids typically have a much higher melting point than hydrocarbons. (2) Further, the compound contains a rigid bicyclic structure, which can further increase the melting point due to the lack of rotational freedom and the increased stability of the crystal lattice. This effect might add another +30 degrees. (3) There is also an additional ester group in the structure, which can increase the melting point due to polarity but not as much as the carboxylic acid. This might add approximately +10 degrees. (4) Lastly, the presence of stereocenters indicates the molecule is chiral, and while chirality itself doesn't have a simple direct correlation with melting point, the specific three-dimensional arrangement can lead to more orderly packing in the solid phase for certain isomers, potentially raising the melting point by a few degrees, estimated at around +5 degrees. Combining all these factors, we can arrive at a predicted melting point.",
        "Prediction": "200.5 degrees Celsius (cyclohexane base + 150 carboxylic acid + 30 bicyclic structure + 10 ester + 5 chirality = 201.5 degrees Celsius, adjusted to 200.5 for rounding and experimental imprecision)",
