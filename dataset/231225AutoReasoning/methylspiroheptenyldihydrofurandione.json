        "Reason": "Starting with the dihydrofuran-2,5-dione moiety, this structure is similar to maleic anhydride with an estimated melting point range around 52-54\u00b0C. The addition of a cyclopentene ring (as part of the spiro compound) can increase rigidity and introduce steric hindrance, which generally raises melting points; this effect could add approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group attached to the spiroheptene ring further increases the molecular weight and provides additional steric hindrance, potentially contributing another +5\u00b0C. Considering all these functional group effects cumulatively, there should be an increase of about +25\u00b0C from the base structure of dihydrofuran-2,5-dione.",

The addition of a spiro-attached cyclopentene ring introduces significant structural rigidity and steric crowding, which are known to elevate melting points due to the restricted molecular rotation and enhanced intermolecular interactions; this effect can be estimated to add approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of the methyl group on the spiroheptene ring likely contributes to an increase in molecular weight and steric hindrance, leading to an elevation of the melting point by around +10\u00b0C. Adding these values gives a cumulative adjustment of +40\u00b0C relative to the base structure of the dihydrofuran-2,5-dione.",
