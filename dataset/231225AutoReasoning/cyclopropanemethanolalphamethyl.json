        "Reason": "The molecule cyclopropanemethanol, .alpha.-methyl-, contains several structural features affecting its melting point. Firstly, the basic cyclopropane ring structure has strain energy due to its angular tension, which often leads to lower melting points as the molecules do not pack efficiently. However, adding a hydroxyl (OH) group usually raises the melting point substantially due to hydrogen bonding, potentially by +100 degrees or more. A methyl group (CH3) is relatively small and may increase the melting point slightly by +5 to 10 degrees due to increased van der Waals interactions. Lastly, an additional alpha-methyl group may further contribute a minor increase since it can induce steric hindrance and disrupt the crystal lattice, adding another +5 degrees.",
