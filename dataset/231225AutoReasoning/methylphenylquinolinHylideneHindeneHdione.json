        "Reason": "The core structure to consider is quinoline, which has a melting point of around 76\u00b0C. The 2,1,3-indenedione group, with its conjugated ketones, will likely increase the melting point due to added rigidity and planarity which enhances \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions (+40). The 4-methylphenyl group is similar to a toluene moiety attached to the ring, which would normally increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions (+20). The overall molecular complexity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding can further increase the melting point significantly (+106).",
