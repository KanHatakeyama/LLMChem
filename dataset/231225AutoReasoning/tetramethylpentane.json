        "Reason": "The target compound is 2,2,3,4-tetramethylpentane, which is derived from pentane. The base molecule, pentane, has a melting point of around -130 degrees Celsius. Adding methyl groups generally increases the melting point, but due to the branching and the additional steric hindrance that these groups create, they will, in this case, have a lesser effect or potentially even lower the melting point due to decreased ability of the molecules to pack efficiently. Let's assign an average increase of about +2 degrees Celsius per methyl group due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but then also consider the effect of branching, which tends to decrease the melting point. Given that there is significant branching (four methyl groups), let's approximate a decrease of -3 degrees Celsius for the packing inefficiency.",
