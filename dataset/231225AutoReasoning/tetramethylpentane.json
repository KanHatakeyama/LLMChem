        "Reason": "The base structure is pentane, which has a melting point of around -130\u00b0C. Each methyl group added to a molecule generally increases the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces as there are more atoms to interact with each other, although branching can lower the melting point because it leads to a structure that packs less efficiently in the solid phase. For 2,3,3,4-tetramethylpentane, there are four methyl groups introduced but the compound is highly branched. We can roughly estimate the addition of each methyl group to increase the melting point by about +5 to +10\u00b0C from the base structure. However, the extensive branching will offset this increase significantly, leading to a smaller shift in melting point. Without exact incremental values for the effects of branching, it is difficult to predict accurately. We must approximate the effects based on typical alkane and branched alkane behaviour.",
