        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of hexamethylene diisocyanate, we analyze the effects of its functional groups and molecular structure. The basic unit we can compare it to is hexane, which has a melting point of around -95\u00b0C. However, the introduction of the isocyanate groups (\u2013N=C=O) generally increases the melting point due to the presence of polar groups that lead to stronger intermolecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions. The presence of two isocyanate groups also introduces the potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules, although they cannot form internal hydrogen bonds due to the positioning on the ends of a linear chain. Each isocyanate group could be approximated to increase the melting point by about 15\u00b0C. Consequently, we would expect an overall increase in the melting point relative to hexane.",
