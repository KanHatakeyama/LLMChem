        "Reason": "The base structure here is cyclopentane, which has a melting point of -94 degrees Celsius. The presence of three methyl groups, one in trans- (opposite side) and two in cis- (same side) configuration, will affect the melting point. Each methyl group generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, since they cause steric strain, especially the cis-configured methyl groups, which are closer and interact more strenuously, the overall effect might be a reduced melting point due to destabilization of the crystal structure. One could estimate roughly +5 degrees for the trans-configured methyl group and -10 degrees for each of the cis-configured methyl groups due to steric strain.",
