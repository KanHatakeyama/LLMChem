        "Reason": "The base compound benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of two isocyanato groups (N=C=O) to the benzene ring significantly increases the melting point due to the introduction of polar functionality and the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, as well as dipole-dipole interactions. Each isocyanato group can be estimated to raise the melting point substantially. The exact amount of increase per functional group is not given, but considering both the nature of the functional groups and their positioning on the benzene ring, it is reasonable to assume each contributes significantly to the elevation of the melting point.",
        "Prediction": "Based on the effects of the isocyanato groups, we can predict an increase of (let's say) 46\u00b0C per isocyanato group attached to the benzene. Adding this increment twice for the two isocyanato groups would result in an increase of 92\u00b0C. Starting from the base value of benzene at 5.5\u00b0C, this results in a predicted melting point for the compound of 97.5\u00b0C.",
