        "Reason": "The compound deflazacort is a complex corticosteroid with several functional groups that contribute to its melting point. To predict the melting point, we shall start with the basic unit we will compare to: hydrocortisone, which has a melting point of about 220\u00b0C. Both steroids have a similar corticosteroid base structure, but we will consider the effect of additional functional groups present in deflazacort. Hydrocortisone doesn't have the 21-acetate group present in deflazacort. The ester group generally increases melting point due to the added dipole and potential for additional hydrogen bonding. The presence of the ester could contribute approximately +20\u00b0C. Another group to consider is the acetonide on the 16,17 position, which adds rigidity to the molecule, probably contributing another +10\u00b0C. Deflazacort also possesses a modified oxazoline ring at the 21 position, which further increases molecular rigidity and intermolecular interactions, potentially adding around +5\u00b0C. However, the presence of a methyl group at the 21 position, which might reduce the melting point compared to the similar hydrocortisone unit by -2\u00b0C due to the increased branch that may hinder close-packing of the molecules. The sum of these modifications leads to the predicted melting point.",
        "Prediction": "220 + 20 (21-acetate group) + 10 (acetonide) + 5 (oxazoline ring) - 2 (21 methyl group) = 253\u00b0C",
        "Prediction(integer)": 253.0
