        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The amino group (-NH2) typically raises the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding capabilities, with an assumed increase of +80\u00b0C. Each bromine is a large halogen substituent which generally increases the melting point through added molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, let's estimate +30\u00b0C per bromine atom. The hydroxyl (-OH) group also increases the melting point significantly due to hydrogen bonding, and we can estimate an additional +70\u00b0C for that functional group.",

The amino group (-NH2) typically raises the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding capabilities; this can be estimated at +80\u00b0C. Each bromine atom, being a large substituent, also increases the melting point; given the effects of halogens on molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, let's estimate this at about +20\u00b0C per bromine atom (instead of +30\u00b0C), taking into account the cumulative effect might not scale linearly. The hydroxyl (-OH) group significantly increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, as well, and we can estimate this at +50\u00b0C for that functional group (instead of +70\u00b0C), considering the interaction may not be just additive but also influenced by the overall molecular structure.",
