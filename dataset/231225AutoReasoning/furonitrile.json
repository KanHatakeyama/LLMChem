        "Reason": "The basic unit, furan, has a melting point of -85.6\u00b0C. The presence of a nitrile (cyano) group generally increases the melting point due to the strong dipole-dipole interaction. However, the extent of the change is influenced by how much the nitrile group distorts the planar structure and electron delocalization of the furan ring. Based on typical values, the addition of a nitrile could add approximately +100\u00b0C to the melting point of the basic unit. Considering the ring strain and smaller size of furan compared to benzene, the nitrile group might have a less pronounced effect than it would on benzene derivatives. Therefore, considering these factors, an estimated +115\u00b0C adjustment for the nitrile group might be applied to the base value of furan.",
