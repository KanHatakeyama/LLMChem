        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound can be considered as the simplest thioether, dimethyl sulfide, with a boiling point of -98\u00b0C. The addition of a phosphate group (OP(C)(F)=O) introduces strong polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, significantly increasing the melting point, let's estimate this as +80\u00b0C. The presence of fluorine can also significantly increase the melting point due to its high electronegativity and strong dipole-dipole interactions, we estimate this as +10\u00b0C. The two methyl groups attached to the phosphorus likely don't significantly alter the melting point due to their small size and the already bulky and rigid structure given by the central phosphorus, so we'll add only +5\u00b0C for both. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C) adds steric bulk, which can disrupt crystal lattice packing and therefore slightly decrease the melting point, estimated as -5\u00b0C.",
