        "Reason": "The basic structure for comparison is benzene, with a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Terphenyl is composed of three linked benzene rings, which significantly increases the melting point due to the larger pi system and greater molecular rigidity: +120\u00b0C. The boronic acid group increases the melting point due to its ability to engage in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding: +65\u00b0C. Additionally, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the boron atom can engage in further hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point by another +45\u00b0C. The ortho and para substituents slightly hinder crystal packing, which would generally lower the melting point, but this affect is subsidiary compared to the strong effects of increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding: -5\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basic structure for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The terphenyl backbone, consisting of three linked benzene rings, introduces greater molecular rigidity and a larger, delocalized \u03c0-electron system, which significantly increases the melting point due to enhanced pi-stacking and van der Waals forces: +150\u00b0C. The boronic acid group contributes to an increased melting point through its capacity for strong dative bonding with the hydroxyl groups, as well as potential hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which is expected to raise the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the ortho and para positions of the substituents on the rings may allow for more efficient packing, despite the potential steric hindrance, contributing a smaller but positive increment: +10\u00b0C. The overall effect is a substantial increase in melting point due to added rigidity, intermolecular forces, and potential hydrogen bonding.",

        "Reason": "Terphenyl is a system of three benzene rings connected by single carbon-carbon bonds. The basic benzene unit has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Connecting benzene rings typically increases the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity of the molecule. An increase of about 100 degrees Celsius can be estimated per additional ring. The boronic acid group introduces polar bonding and potential for hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point further. Each hydroxyl group associated with boron could potentially add about 40-50 degrees Celsius due to hydrogen bonding capability and polarity. Thus, the expected shifts are: \n- For three phenyl groups: +200 (since we're adding two additional phenyl groups to the benzene base)\n- For the boronic acid group with two OH groups: +80 to +100 (due to the introduction of hydrogen bonding and increased polarity)\nTotal expected increase: 200 + 80 to 100",
