        "Reason": "The base structure for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of three chlorine atoms substantially increases the melting point because they are heavy atoms and introduce strong dipole moments, increasing intermolecular forces. Each chlorine may roughly contribute +50 \u00b0C to the melting point. An ester group typically raises melting points due to its polar nature and the ability to form additional dipole-dipole interactions, contributing approximately +20 \u00b0C. The methoxy group attached to the aromatic ring can raise the melting point due to its electron-donating properties and the fact that it introduces another polar functional group; we estimate it to contribute around +15 \u00b0C. The isopropyl group, which is nonpolar and branched, tends to lower melting points due to steric hindrance and reduces the overall symmetry of the molecule; its effect might be around -10 \u00b0C. When these adjustments are combined, we obtain a predicted melting point for silvex.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (base benzene) + 3(50) (chlorine atoms) + 20 (ester group) + 15 (methoxy group) - 10 (isopropyl group) = 180.5 \u00b0C",
        "Prediction(integer)": 180.0
