        "Reason": "Basic unit naphthalene has a melting point of 80.4\u00b0C. A methyl substituent generally lowers the melting point because of its electron-donating properties, which can disrupt the pi-stacking interactions present in polycyclic aromatic systems and also create a molecular asymmetry, which reduces the melting point. In the case of 2-methylnaphthalene, adding a methyl group to naphthalene would reduce the melting point by approximately 46.7\u00b0C (80.4\u00b0C - 33.7\u00b0C).",
