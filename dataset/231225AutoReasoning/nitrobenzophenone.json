        "Reason": "The target compound 4-nitrobenzophenone is a derivative of benzophenone with the addition of a nitro group. We can analyze the influence on the melting point by considering each functional group compared to benzene as the basic unit. For the analysis, we will start with benzene as the base compound and then consider the effects of the ketone group, the additional phenyl ring, and finally, the nitro group. \n\nStarting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C: \n- Ketone group: +40\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C (the contribution of a carbonyl group usually increases intermolecular forces significantly, thereby raising the melting point). \n- Additional phenyl ring, as in benzophenone, would add around +30\u00b0C, due to increased molecular weight and the planar structure which allows better packing in the solid form. \n- Nitro group: +60\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C (nitro groups tend to significantly increase melting points due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature, which enhances intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding if H-bonding groups are present or dipole-dipole interactions). \n\nOverall, the presence of the polar nitro group has a substantial effect on the melting point, likely contributing the most to the increase compared to the effect of the carbonyl and the additional aromatic ring.",
