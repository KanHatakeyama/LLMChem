        "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit, benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we look at the effects of adding a bromine and iodine substituents on the para position. Bromine has a significant inductive effect and a sizeable contribution due to its atomic mass; it could add approximately +50 to the melting point because halogens generally increase the melting point of aromatic compounds due to their weight and van der Waals interactions. Iodine, being larger than bromine, will further increase the melting point, perhaps adding another +35 to the melting point for similar reasons, but somewhat less than bromine due its lesser electronegativity. The overall prediction needs to take into account the potential steric hindrance and polarizability of the heavy halogen atoms, which would increase intermolecular interactions leading to higher melting point.",
