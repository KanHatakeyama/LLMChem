        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) substantially increases the melting point due to the ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds; this can increase the melting point by approximately +200\u00b0C. The chloro substituent (Cl) is electron-withdrawing and also participates in intermolecular interactions, potentially increasing the melting point by around +5\u00b0C. The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group and tends to increase the melting point significantly due to increased polarity and the potential for intermolecular interactions, contributing potentially another +20 to +30\u00b0C. Combining these effects, we can predict an increase in the melting point due to the combined electron-withdrawing effects and the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (benzene) + 200 (carboxylic acid) + 5 (chloro group) + 25 (nitro group) = 235.5\u00b0C",
