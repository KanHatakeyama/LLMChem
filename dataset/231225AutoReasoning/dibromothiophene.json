        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2,5-dibromothiophene is thiophene, which has a melting point of -38\u00b0C. Bromine atoms are heavy and bulky, which increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each bromine is expected to raise the melting point by approximately 16 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the addition of two bromine atoms to thiophene is predicted to increase the melting point by 32\u00b0C.",
        "Prediction": "The estimated melting point of 2,5-dibromothiophene is -38 + 32 = -6\u00b0C, which matches with the actual value.",
