        "Reason": "The basic unit for alkanes is methane, which has a melting point of -182. Actual value is increased due to the longer carbon chain which increases the surface area and London dispersion forces. Each additional methylene (CH2) group in a linear alkane typically raises the melting point by approximately 20 degrees. Undecane has ten more methylene groups than methane.",
