        "Reason": "The melting point of a related simple compound, aniline, is about 184 degrees Celsius. Considering each functional group on 4-methoxy-2-nitroaniline: the methoxy group (-OCH3) usually donates electron density through resonance and slightly increases melting point compared to hydrogen due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, so let's say +5 degrees. The nitro group (-NO2), being an electron-withdrawing group often disrupts the resonance stabilization in the aromatic ring, and could potentially decrease the melting point as less stable crystal lattices are formed due to the more rigid structure and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding is not possible, estimate -30 degrees. Amine substituents can form intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point, so let's add +10 degrees for that effect. Therefore, the adjustments collectively result in a decrease of 15 degrees from the aniline base.",

This might reduce the melting point significantly as it could impede effective packing, estimate -60 degrees. - The amino group (-NH2) can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, leading to a higher melting point. However, the presence of the nitro group may reduce this effect due to steric hindrance and internal competition for hydrogen bonding, so the net increase might be less, estimate +10 degrees.

The melting point of aniline is approximately 6\u00b0C. The methoxy group (-OCH3) is a generally electron-donating group, which can marginally increases the melting point due to enhanced molecular packing, so let's assign a +15\u00b0C for this substituent. The nitro group (-NO2) is a strongly electron-withdrawing group and significantly affects intermolecular forces by contributing to the overall polarity of the molecule; it generally raises the melting point substantially due to stronger intermolecular interactions, so we will assign a +90\u00b0C for this group. Additionally, these two substituents are in the para position to each other, potentially allowing for more symmetrical molecular packing, which could further contribute to an elevated melting point. However, without specific data for the para substitution effect, we will not assign an additional numerical value for it.",

        "Reason": "The compound 4-methoxy-2-nitroaniline consists of a benzene ring as its basic unit, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C for benzene itself. Each substituent on the ring will affect this value differently. The methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) is an electron-donating group and tends to have a stabilizing resonance effect with the ring, which might slightly increase the melting point; let's estimate this as +10\u00b0C. The nitro group (\u2013NO2) is strongly electron-withdrawing and has a significant resonance effect as well, making the structure more rigid and substantially increasing the melting point. For the nitro group's influence, we could estimate an increase of +80\u00b0C. Aniline (C6H5NH2) as a base structure has a much higher melting point of around 184\u00b0C because of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is likely reduced here due to the presence of the other substituents, so we will not simply add this value. Instead, taking the aniline base as a starting point and considering that the methoxy group may have a weaker influence on melting point than the nitro group, we can estimate a slight decrease from the aniline base due to the methoxy group. Accounting for the resonance and intermolecular forces, we will decrease the aniline base melting point by an estimated -40\u00b0C when incorporating the cumulative effects of both substituents on the aniline base.",

        "Reason": "The compound 4-methoxy-2-nitroaniline consists of a benzene ring, and the basic melting point of benzene is very low (5.5\u00b0C). However, because the structure is significantly different with the presence of other functional groups, the melting point of benzene itself is not a useful starting point. The primary functional group here is the aniline (phenylamine) part which has a melting point significantly higher than benzene due to hydrogen bonding interactions between molecules. Taking aniline as a reference, which has a melting point around 184\u00b0C, we evaluate the effect of 4-methoxy and 2-nitro groups. The methoxy group, being electron-donating, generally increases the melting point by improving the electron density on the ring and consequently the intermolecular interactions; estimating this effect to be around +20\u00b0C. The nitro group, being a strong electron-withdrawing group, will significantly increase the structure's rigidity and the melting point by approximately +90\u00b0C due to its tendency to form a more stabilized and less flexible ring system. The presence of these groups concurrently modifies the hydrogen-bonding networks typical of aniline and could disrupt the crystal lattice, possibly decreasing the melting point. Considering the disrupting effect on hydrogen bonding, an estimated decrease of -40\u00b0C from the addition of these groups to aniline can be factored in. Thus, considering the contribution of the functional groups to aniline's melting point, we postulate an adjusted melting point that will be a net increase over the base value of aniline.",
