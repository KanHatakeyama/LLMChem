        "Reason": "The compound in question is Methyl 3,6-bis-O-(2,2-dimethylpropanoyl)-alpha-D-mannopyranoside, a molecule with multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. The base structure is an alpha-D-mannopyranoside, a six-membered sugar ring, which typically has a melting point range of approximately 160-180\u00b0C. Each functional group will alter this base value: \n- Methyl ester groups, which tend to lower melting points compared to the corresponding acids due to their lower capability for intermolecular hydrogen bonding: -5\u00b0C for each, totaling -10\u00b0C.\n- Two 2,2-dimethylpropanoyl groups are bulky esters that will cause steric hindrance and reduce crystalline packing efficiency, likely lowering the melting point further. The effect of each bulky ester is estimated to be -30\u00b0C, totaling -60\u00b0C.\n- There is an additional methoxy group (OC) that could slightly lower the melting point due to its small size and electron-donating nature, estimated at -5\u00b0C.\nCombining these effects results in a predicted melting point decrease of -75\u00b0C from the base structure.",
