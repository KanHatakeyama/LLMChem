        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-furoic acid can be considered furan, which has a melting point of -85.6 \u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group typically substantially raises the melting point due to its ability to form strong hydrogen bonds, and we can roughly estimate this increase to be around +200 \u00b0C. An additional factor is the aromatic system which already contributes to the stabilization and raises the melting point compared to non-aromatic systems. However, given that furan is the core structure, we will consider its aromatic character already accounted for in the basic estimate of furan's melting point. So the primary consideration is the introduction of the carboxylic acid group.",

The introduction of a carboxylic acid group (COOH) to the furan significantly increases the melting point, due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +215.6 \u00b0C. No additional functional groups are present that significantly shift the melting point further.",
