        "Reason": "The target compound, androstane, can be dissected into its basic structural components for melting point analysis. While we do not have a direct basic unit for comparison in this case, we can reference similar steroid skeletons such as cholestane, which has a melting point close to 80 degrees Celsius. Androstane lacks any polar functional groups that would significantly modify the melting point through effects like hydrogen bonding. However, it possesses a high degree of symmetry and van der Waals interactions due to its four fused rings, which would increase the melting point. Even though androstane does have alkyl side chains, these increase molecular weight and surface area for van der Waals interactions, which typically increases melting point, but in the case of androstane, the effect on melting point is not as pronounced as it might be on boiling point. Since androstane lacks additional functional groups beyond the hydrocarbon framework, we would estimate the influence of its structure alone to moderately decrease the melting point from the reference steroid structure, like cholestane, by about -30 degrees Celsius due to its less bulky size and slightly lower molecular symmetry.",
