        "Reason": "The structure of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane consists of a propane backbone with two methyl groups and a chlorine atom attached to the central carbon. Base molecular structure (propane) has a melting point of -188\u00b0C. Each methyl group being bulky in nature will increase the melting point due to the increment in molecular weight and slightly increased van der Waals forces, let's estimate this effect to be around +15\u00b0C for each methyl group. The chlorine atom being electronegative not only adds to the molecular weight but also introduces dipole-dipole interactions, which increase the melting point. This effect of the chlorine can be estimated to be about +25\u00b0C. However, the presence of both bulky methyl groups and chlorine on the same carbon can create steric hindrance, which might slightly reduce the melting point. We will estimate this reduction to be around -5\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for this structure could be considered as propane, which has a melting point of -187.7\u00b0C. Each methyl group has a +3\u00b0C contribution to the melting point due to increased molecular size and Van der Waals forces. Since 2-methylpropane (isobutane) has a melting point of -159.6\u00b0C, this indicates that each added methyl group to propane raises the melting point by approximately 14 degrees. However, for the third methyl group, due to steric hindrance and maximized Van der Waals interactions, we will consider a reduced incremental contribution of 7\u00b0C. The chlorine substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, which could potentially lower the melting point due to a slight decrease in polarizability; we can estimate this effect to be around -5\u00b0C.",

Each methyl group in isobutane raises the melting point by approximately 14\u00b0C to a value of -159.6\u00b0C for 2-methylpropane. Assuming a further increase from an additional methyl group, but with diminished effect due to steric hindrance, we propose an incremental raise of about 5\u00b0C instead of 14\u00b0C. The chlorine atom is larger and more electronegative than hydrogen, and thus increases intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. This effect generally raises the melting point; we can estimate this effect to be around +8\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The target compound is 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, which is a derivative of propane. Propane itself, as an alkane, has a low melting point due to weak van der Waals forces. The addition of chlorine introduces both polarizability and dipole-dipole interactions, which typically increase the melting point. However, the tert-butyl group is a bulky group that causes steric hindrance, disrupting the crystal lattice and reducing intermolecular interactions. While chlorine would normally increase the melting point by +20 to +40 due to its electronegativity and size, the tert-butyl groups, each contributing to steric hindrance, would each decrease the melting point by about -10. Thus, if propane has a baseline melting point of around -188, the increase due to chlorine would be countered by the decrease due to the bulky tert-butyl groups.",
