        "Reason": "The base molecule ethane has a melting point of -182.8 degrees Celsius. Each fluorine substituent on ethane increases the melting point due to the electronegativity of fluorine, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Additionally, the introduction of fluorine atoms also increases the molecular symmetry which tends to increase the melting point. For this compound, five fluorine atoms are added to ethane. If we consider each fluorine to increase the melting point by approximately 16 degrees Celsius (a rough estimation for haloalkanes), then the total increase would be roughly 5 x 16 = 80 degrees Celsius.",
