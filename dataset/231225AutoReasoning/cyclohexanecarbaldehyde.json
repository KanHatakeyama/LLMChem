        "Reason": "The basic unit, cyclohexane has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. The additional aldehyde group typically has a polar effect, which can raise the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole interactions. However, aldehydes can also form hydrogen bonds with themselves, which can lead to a more complex prediction. For aliphatic aldehydes, we might estimate an increase due to the presence of carbonyl group which may be approximately +30 degrees Celsius, considering both the polarity and the ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules.",
