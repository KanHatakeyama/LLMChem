        "Reason": "The basic unit to consider is butyric acid which has a melting point of -5.1 degrees Celsius. The methyl ester (methylbutyrate) is expected to have a lower melting point due to the following reasons: esterification typically lowers the melting point as it reduces the potential for hydrogen bonding compared to the acid; the ester functional group is less polar than the carboxylic acid group and often results in lower melting points. Esters generally have lower melting points compared to their corresponding carboxylic acids by about 70-90 degrees Celsius. The exact shift can vary based on the alkyl group size and structure.",
        "Prediction": "-80 to -95.1 (taking -5.1 as a base for butyric acid and subtracting 70 to 90 to account for the esterification effect)",
        "Prediction(integer)": -85.0
