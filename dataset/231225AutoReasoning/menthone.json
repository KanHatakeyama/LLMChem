        "Reason": "The base compound for comparison is cyclohexanone, which has a melting point of about 47\u00b0C. The presence of substituents will affect the symmetry and the ability of the molecule to pack in a solid state, thus changing its melting point. In (-)-menthone, the functional groups and their effects are as follows: \n - Methyl groups: There are two methyl groups (-CH3) attached to a cyclohexanone backbone. Each methyl group would likely decrease the melting point due to increased steric hindrance, less symmetry, and less efficient molecular packing. Each methyl group might decrease the melting point by approximately 15\u00b0C. \n - Isopropyl group (C(CH3)2): An isopropyl group introduces more steric hindrance and bulkiness compared to a methyl group. Given its larger size, the effect on lowering the melting point could be slightly greater than that of a methyl group. It might decrease melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C. \nCombining these effects gives a total estimated decrease in melting point of 50\u00b0C (15+15+20) from the base structure melting point of cyclohexanone.",
