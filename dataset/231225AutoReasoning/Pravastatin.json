        "Reason": "Pravastatin has a complex structure which can be broken down to various functional groups and stereochemistry that affect its melting point. Here are some considerations: - Basic hydrocarbon chain: Provides a basic melting point threshold. - Hydroxyl groups (~ -30 each): Hydrogen bonding with water or other hydroxyl groups will lower the melting point, pravastatin has 4 of these. - Carboxylic acid group (+50): Strong hydrogen bonding potential would increase the melting point significantly. - Lactone ring (another +20): Cyclic esters tend to raise the melting point because of the rigid ring structure increasing the stability of the molecule. - Stereochemistry (unknown, but potentially +10 to +20): The presence of chirality and specific three-dimensional arrangement might alter the crystal packing and intermolecular interactions, potentially increasing the melting point. Assuming a very basic molecule starts around 100 degrees. Adding up the effects mentioned: Basic molecule: +100 4 Hydroxyl groups: -120 (4*-30) Carboxylic acid: +50 Lactone ring: +20 Stereochemistry: +15 The prediction would be 100 - 120 + 50 + 20 + 15 = 65. Since the actual melting point of pravastatin is notably higher, it's clear that the contribution from carboxylic acid and lactone groups to the melting point is more significant, and perhaps the penalty from hydroxyl groups is less severe due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or crystal packing efficiencies.",
