The addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups is expected to significantly increase the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Each hydroxyl group could increase the melting point approximately by +70 to +80\u00b0C. The two phenyl groups will add to the molecular weight and rigidity of the compound, which commonly results in a further increase in melting point; however, this increase is often less pronounced than the effect of hydrogen bonding. Moreover, sterically, the two phenyl groups flank the hydroxyl-bearing carbon, which could cause some steric hindrance and may slightly reduce the efficacy of hydrogen bonding between molecules but not enough to overcome the significant increase due to the hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the effect of the phenyl groups might be estimated at about +5 to +10\u00b0C.",

The addition of a hydroxyl group to benzene generally increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds; each hydroxyl group can be estimated to contribute an increase of about 100\u00b0C. The two additional phenyl groups will not significantly raise the melting point since its contributions are relatively small due to dispersion forces and potential ring interactions; let's approximate the increase due to each phenyl group to be about 5\u00b0C. Therefore, the combined effect of the functional groups can be estimated as +210\u00b0C (100\u00b0C per hydroxyl group and 5\u00b0C per phenyl group).",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for hydrobenzoin is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two hydroxyl groups in hydrobenzoin allows for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, substantially raising the melting point; each hydroxyl group may contribute an estimated increase of approximately 100\u00b0C due to this strong interaction. Additionally, two phenyl groups are part of the molecule, each of which can marginally increase the melting point due to enhanced van der Waals interactions attributed to the larger molecular surface; we can estimate a 5\u00b0C increase per additional phenyl group. Summing the contributions from the hydroxyl and the phenyl groups gives a predicted increase of 210\u00b0C from the base value of benzene (2 * 100\u00b0C for hydroxyl groups + 2 * 5\u00b0C for phenyl groups).",

        "Reason": "Hydrobenzoin contains two phenyl rings and two hydroxyl (-OH) groups. Starting with benzene, which has a relatively low melting point due to its symmetry and size, the effect of the different functional groups needs to be considered. Each phenyl ring contributes to increasing the melting point due to increased pi-stacking interactions and van der Waals forces, potentially adding about +30\u00b0C per ring. The -OH groups are capable of hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point; each hydroxyl group may contribute approximately +100\u00b0C due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Overall, the addition of both bulky and hydrogen bonding groups to benzene creates a compound with a notably higher melting point.",
