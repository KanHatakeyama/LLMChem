        "Reason": "The starting point for predicting the melting point of ethyl furoate (furoic acid, ethyl ester) should be the melting point of furoic acid itself since the key structural features affecting the melting point are present in both. Furoic acid has a melting point of about 132\u00b0C. The functional groups present in ethyl furoate that will affect the melting point relative to furoic acid are the ethoxy group (\u2014OC2H5) replacing the acidic hydrogen, and the furan ring. The presence of an ester should lower the melting point because it removes intermolecular hydrogen bonding that would be present in the free acid, causing a significant decrease in melting point. Let\u2019s estimate this to be about -100\u00b0C. The furan ring has a mild electron-donating effect, which could provide some additional stability, but since it\u2019s already accounted for in the furoic acid melting point, it will not play a major role. Therefore, the primary consideration is the replacement of the acidic hydrogen with the ethyl ester. We would consider smaller effects, like the potential increase due to the ethoxy group adding molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but these are minor compared to the loss of hydrogen bonding, and we might estimate this to be a +2\u00b0C adjustment.",
