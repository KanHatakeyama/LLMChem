        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Chloro groups tend to increase melting point due to their electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular forces. Each chloro group on a benzene ring is expected to add approximately +20\u00b0C due to these stronger van der Waals forces. However, the 1,2-disubstitution pattern causes steric strain and a small ring distortion which might reduce the melting point slightly compared to symmetrical patterns like 1,4-disubstitution, but this effect is minimal in the case of chloro substituents. Hence the net effect is the addition of two chloro groups.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. When we add chloro groups, they typically increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and the increased intermolecular dipole-dipole interaction. Each chloro group would normally add approximately +20\u00b0C to the benzene ring. However, with 1,2-substitution, there could be some steric hindrance that affects the crystalline packing, and thus slightly reduces the typical increase in melting point provided by chloro groups. After considering these factors, we can correct our estimate to reflect a smaller increase per chloro group in this particular substitution pattern. A more accurate estimate might be +16\u00b0C per chloro group instead of +20\u00b0C.",
