        "Reason": "The target compound (1,4-diphenyl)-1,3-butadiene consists of a 1,3-butadiene unit with additional benzene rings attached at each end. The base structure, 1,3-butadiene, has a melting point of approximately -108.9 degrees Celsius. Each phenyl group is a large planar substituent which increases the melting point by providing more surface area for van der Waals interactions and enhancing the symmetry and possibility for \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions: Phenyl group: roughly +130 degrees Celsius for each, due to increased molecular weight, stronger van der Waals interactions, and symmetry which facilitates packing. Thus, the overall effect is cumulative for both phenyl groups.",
