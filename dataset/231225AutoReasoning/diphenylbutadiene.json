        "Reason": "The base unit to consider is butadiene, which has a melting point around -4.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of phenyl groups typically raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and greater molecular rigidity. Two phenyl groups are expected to significantly increase the melting point relative to butadiene. Each phenyl group may add around +80-100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to the aforementioned interactions and rigidity. The conjugation across the 1,3-butadiene and the two phenyl rings could further slightly raise the melting point by stabilizing the molecule's structure.",

        "Reason": "The fundamental compound to consider is 1,3-butadiene, with a melting point around -4.5 degrees Celsius. Phenyl groups when added to a molecule, tend to increase the melting point because of enhanced pi-pi stacking interactions, increased van der Waals forces, and larger molecular size. However, the phenyl groups in 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene also contribute to the rigidity of the molecule due to their planar shape and ability to engage in conjugation with the butadiene portion, yielding a more pronounced rise in the melting point. We estimate each phenyl group to contribute approximately +78 to +80 degrees Celsius to the melting point, based on known data of similar compounds.",
