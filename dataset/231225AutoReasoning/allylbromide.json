        "Reason": "The base structure is ethylene (C=C), which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. Adding a bromine atom increases the molecular weight and the polarizability, leading to stronger London dispersion forces. This effect typically increases the melting point. However, a bromine atom also significantly increases the size of the molecule, which can decrease the melting point due to steric hindrance and less efficient packing. Combining these effects, we can estimate that the addition of the bromine atom increases the melting point by about +40 to +50 degrees Celsius.",
