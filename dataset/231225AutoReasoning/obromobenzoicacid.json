        "Reason": "Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C as a reference, we consider the effects of the substituents: a carboxylic acid group and a bromine atom. The carboxylic acid group forms strong hydrogen bonds and contributes significantly to the melting point. It is a rigid planar group which aligns well in the crystal lattice, typically increasing the melting point by about 110\u00b0C (comparison with benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122\u00b0C). The bromine atom is a large, electron-rich substituent which interferes with tight crystal packing due to its size and contributes much less to the melting point elevation than the carboxylic acid group; however, it does engage in some polar interactions. The addition of a Br atom to benzene typically increases the melting point by around 30\u00b0C (comparison with bromobenzene, which has a melting point of -31.1\u00b0C, versus benzene). The positioning of the Br atom ortho to the carboxylic acid may affect the crystalline structure, but for a rough prediction, these effects may be considered additive. Therefore, we predict the melting point by summing these contributions to the base value of benzene.",
