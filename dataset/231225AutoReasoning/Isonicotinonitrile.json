        "Reason": "The molecule Isonicotinonitrile consists of a benzene ring with a nitrile (C\u2261N) and a pyridine (nitrogen in the ring) substituent. Benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The pyridine nitrogen in the ring changes the electron distribution and slightly increases the polarity but does not significantly increase the melting point since it substitutes a carbon in the ring without adding much mass or bulk, so we can estimate a minor increase (+5). The nitrile group is a strong electron-withdrawing group due to the triple bond and electronegative nitrogen, which increases intermolecular forces due to dipole-dipole interactions and slightly raises the melting point, although less effectively compared to other polar substituents like -OH or -COOH, we could estimate this to be around +20. Therefore, summing these changes provides an estimated melting point for Isonicotinonitrile.",

        "Reason": "The molecule Isonicotinonitrile consists of a pyridine ring, which is a benzene ring with one nitrogen atom replacing one CH group. The basic melanization for benzene is 5.5 degrees Celsius. Introducing a nitrogen atom in the ring to form pyridine increases the polarity and offers some capacity for hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point, though the impact is relatively moderate due to the fact that it replaces a carbon atom without increasing molecular mass significantly. This can be estimated as a +13 increase. The nitrile group is an electron-withdrawing group that enhances intermolecular forces by increasing the molecular polarity through the cyano group's dipole. Nitrile groups typically raise the melting point by +25 compared to benzene. Combining these effects yields a cumulative estimate.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison here is pyridine, which has a melting point of around -42\u00b0C. The nitrile group generally increases the melting point due to its strong dipole and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions. Furthermore, nitrile groups can engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which generally raises the melting point significantly. A nitrile substituent on the pyridine ring (as in isonicotinonitrile) can be expected to raise the melting point by approximately 118\u00b0C (considering such effects in similar structures).",
