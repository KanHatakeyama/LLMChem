        "Reason": "The compound 3-nitrophenyl isocyanate comprises a phenyl ring, a nitro group, and an isocyanate group. Starting with benzene which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, the phenyl ring provides a base structure. The nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, generally increases melting point due to the induction of polarity and possible intermolecular hydrogen bonding, this could add roughly 45 degrees Celsius to the melting point. The isocyanate group may form hydrogen bonds but also has a linear structure which could pack efficiently, potentially adding an estimated 20 degrees Celsius to the melting point. The melting point should be adjusted by the cumulative effect of these functional groups.",

        "Reason": "The compound 3-nitrophenyl isocyanate consists of a phenyl ring base, a nitro group, and an isocyanate group. The phenyl ring provides a melting point base already associated with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and typically raises the melting point by introducing polarity and enhancing hydrogen bonding, which could add approximately 45 degrees Celsius. The isocyanate group contributes to hydrogen bonding due to the electronegative oxygen atom, and its linear structure may allow for efficient packing, leading to an elevation in the melting point, potentially by an estimated 20 degrees Celsius. However, considering the actual melting point of 52.0 degrees Celsius, the estimation should be adjusted to closer align with this value.",
