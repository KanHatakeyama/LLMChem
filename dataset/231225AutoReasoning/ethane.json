        "Reason": "The base unit for ethane is methane, which has a melting point of -182.5 degrees Celsius. Adding an additional methyl group to form ethane typically increases the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces between molecules, resulting from the larger size and surface area of the molecule. However, this increase is minimal as the shape of the ethane molecule allows for relatively efficient packing. The expected increase would be approximately +0.35 degrees Celsius.",
        "Prediction": "-182.5 (for methane) + 0.35 (additional methyl group) = -182.15",
