        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. A boronic acid group typically increases the melting point due to the capability of forming boroxine rings and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which could add approximately +140\u00b0C. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group that can participate in intermolecular attractions such as dipole-dipole interactions, potentially adding around +30\u00b0C. Moreover, the ortho-position of the substituents could contribute to additional hindrance that slightly elevates the melting point, adding about +5\u00b0C. Summing these adjustments provides an estimated melting point for 2-chlorobenzeneboronic acid.",
