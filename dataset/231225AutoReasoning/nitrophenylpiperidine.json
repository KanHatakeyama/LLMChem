        "Reason": "The compound in question can be broken down into the following functional groups and structural features that affect its melting point: a benzene ring, a nitro group, and a piperidine (six-membered saturated ring containing nitrogen). The benzene ring provides a basic value for aromatic compounds. Each nitro group generally increases the melting point due to its electronegative character providing strong intermolecular dipole-dipole forces and possible hydrogen bonding sites (+80\u00b0C). The piperidine ring will both increase the melting point due to the increase in the molecular weight and symmetry (+20\u00b0C) and decrease it due to it reducing the planarity and thus the stacking ability and crystal packing efficiency of the molecule (-10\u00b0C). Combining these effects with a base value of benzene's melting point, which is around 5.5\u00b0C, we get the following estimate.",
