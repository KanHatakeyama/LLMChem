        "Reason": "The basic unit for consideration should be ethene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. Adding a halogen (in this case, iodine) to a hydrocarbon generally raises its melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the increased strength of intermolecular forces, specifically van der Waals forces. Each iodine could contribute significantly to this increase. For a halogen like iodine, large in size and with a high molecular weight, we can estimate an increase of approximately +70 to +80 degrees Celsius per iodine atom. The cis configuration leads to a more polar molecule compared to the trans configuration which could increase intermolecular attraction and thus could make the melting point slightly higher, but this effect is generally less pronounced than the simple addition of heavy atoms. Assuming some cancellation of dipole in the cis configuration and internal strain, the increase might be at the lower end of the estimate per iodine. Considering two iodine atoms, we can estimate the increase to be around +140 to +160 degrees Celsius in total.",
