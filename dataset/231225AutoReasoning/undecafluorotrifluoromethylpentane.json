        "Reason": "The basic unit here is pentane, which has a melting point of around -130\u00b0C. The introduction of fluorine atoms generally increases the melting point due to the higher electronegativity and stronger intermolecular forces (particularly Van der Waals forces) it induces. Each CF group could increase the melting point by about 5\u00b0C. However, since we have a perfluorinated compound, the cumulative effect could be lessened owing to the already saturated influence of fluorine. The trifluoromethyl group is bulky and could decrease the packing efficiency, which may slightly lower the melting point. We might estimate this effect to be a reduction of about 2\u00b0C for this group. We have a total of 14 CF groups (counting within the trifluoromethyl group too) in undecafluoro-3-trifluoromethyl-pentane. The estimated overall effect of fluorination would be 14 CF groups * 5\u00b0C/CF group = 70\u00b0C increase from the non-fluorinated pentane baseline. Subtracting the trifluoromethyl group influence: 70\u00b0C - 2\u00b0C = 68\u00b0C. Therefore, the expected melting point would be -130\u00b0C + 68\u00b0C = -62\u00b0C.",

The introduction of fluorine atoms generally increases the melting point due to the higher electronegativity and stronger intermolecular forces it introduces, especially Van der Waals forces. Each CF group could increase the melting point by about 10\u00b0C. Given that this is a perfluorinated compound, each CF2 group has a net effect after considering the loss of CH2. The loss of a CH2 decreases the melting point by approximately 5\u00b0C, while the addition of a CF2 increases it by 15\u00b0C, resulting in a net effect of +10\u00b0C per CF2 group. The trifluoromethyl group is bulky and could decrease the packing efficiency, leading to a reduced melting point, approximately -5\u00b0C for this group. We have 4 CF3 groups and 7 CF2 groups. The estimated overall effect would be 4 CF3 groups * (-5\u00b0C/CF3 group) + 7 CF2 groups * 10\u00b0C/CF2 group = -20\u00b0C + 70\u00b0C = 50\u00b0C increase from the non-fluorinated pentane baseline.

        "Reason": "The base unit for this compound is pentane, which has a melting point of around -130. Fluorine atoms, due to their electronegativity, tend to raise the melting point relative to hydrocarbons. In undecafluoro-3-trifluoromethyl-pentane, there are a total of 11 fluorine atoms replacing hydrogen atoms and one CF3 group: Each fluorine could be estimated to raise the melting point by roughly +1. The CF3 group is larger and more polar than a single fluorine, so let's estimate it adds about +5 more than a single fluorine would. Hence, the 11 fluorine atoms together raise the melting point by about 11*1 = +11, and the CF3 group adds +5 for a total of +11 + (5-1, replacing one F in the count for CF3) = +15 shifting from the base pentane value.",
