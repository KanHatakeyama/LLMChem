        "Reason": "The basic unit we will consider here is ribose, which has an estimated melting point of about 85-90\u00b0C due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups that allow for extensive hydrogen bonding. The addition of the nitrogenous base (in this case, guanine) adds a significant amount of molecular complexity and possible hydrogen bonding, thus raising the melting point considerably. The guanine base is estimated to increase the melting point by around 120\u00b0C due to its aromatic structure and potential for additional hydrogen bonds. Nucleosides tend to have higher melting points than simple sugars due to these additional interactions. The N-glycosidic bond, which connects the sugar and base, would not substantially change the melting point. Therefore, considering the contribution of ribose and guanine, the predicted melting point should be the sum of ribose plus the guanine contribution. However, the large molecule might be less ordered crystal lattice due to the conformational flexibility of the sugar and glycosidic bond, which could lower the melting point slightly but this effect is likely minor compared to the strong hydrogen bonding interactions.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, ribose, has a melting point around 85-90\u00b0C. Guanine, the additional nitrogenous base, has a planar aromatic structure with potential for significant hydrogen bonding, which often raises the melting point of compounds it is part of. This contribution can be estimated to be around +150\u00b0C due to increased molecular rigidity and potential for extra hydrogen bonds. However, the presence of the glycosidic bond and additional hydroxyl groups in guanosine introduce further possibilities for hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point even more. Hence, the total increase due to the guanine base and additional hydrogen bonds could be reasoned to be slightly higher than the base estimate. Considering these factors, a predicted melting point increase for guanine and extra hydrogen bonding might be in the range of +155\u00b0C over the base value of ribose.",
