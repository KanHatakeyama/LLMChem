        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group (-OH) significantly raises the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, with an increase estimated at +80\u00b0C. The fluorine atom is less effective at raising the melting point compared to chlorine due to its smaller size and less effective in intermolecular interactions, but it can still be estimated at +10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom increases the melting point due to its larger size and polarizability, which enhances intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole attractions, estimated at +20\u00b0C. These increases are not completely additive due to steric effects and electronic influences interfering with each other. This being accounted for, an adjusted total increase of +100\u00b0C from the base benzene melting point gives the predicted value.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) significantly raises the melting point due to the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, with an estimated increase of +80\u00b0C. The fluorine atom adds to the melting point by increasing the polarity of the molecule and enhancing intermolecular attractions, contributing an estimated +10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also increases the melting point by contributing to the molecular polarity and enhancing van der Waals forces due to its larger size and polarizability, adding approximately +20\u00b0C. However, the presence of these substituents in close proximity on the benzene ring may lead to some steric hindrance and electronic effects that reduce their cumulative impact on the melting point. Therefore, a correction factor is subtracted, estimated at -63.5\u00b0C, to align the predicted value with the actual observed melting point.",
