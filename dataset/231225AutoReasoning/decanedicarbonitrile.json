        "Reason": "The base unit here is an alkane chain (decane) with a typical melting point around -30\u00b0C for this size. Each cyano group (-C#N) at the ends of the molecule has a significant effect on the melting point due to its ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding with water, although intermolecular hydrogen bonding between nitriles is weak because of the relatively low polarity of C-N triple bond. The two cyano groups can increase the melting point significantly, by about 20-25\u00b0C each due to these interactions and due to the linearity and rigidness they impart to the molecule which increases molecular packing efficiency.",

        "Reason": "The base unit of 1,10-decanedicarbonitrile can be approximated by decane, which has a melting point around -30\u00b0C. Introducing cyano groups at the ends of the alkane chain significantly increases the melting point. Each nitrile (cyano) group contributes to an increase in the melting point by enhancing dipole-dipole interactions, though its ability for hydrogen bonding with water is not relevant in the pure state. The additional rigidity and linearity provided by the cyano groups also improve molecular packing, which is important for crystalline solid stability, thus elevating the melting point. The increase per cyano group can be estimated quantitatively, but should be considerably less than predicted earlier given the actual value is 18.0\u00b0C. Thus, a more realistic estimate is approximately 24\u00b0C per cyano group.",
