        "Reason": "The molecular structure of 2-methyl-4-nitrobutane can be broken down into its functional groups and its base structure, butane, for which the melting point is around -138.3 degrees Celsius. The methyl group (+CH3) generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, albeit slightly, which could be estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group (\u2014NO2) is highly electronegative and introduces significant dipole-dipole interactions, considerably raising the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius due to the strong intermolecular forces it induces. Combining these adjustments, the predicted melting point becomes higher than that of butane.",

        "Reason": "The base structure for 2-methyl-4-nitrobutane is butane, with an estimated melting point of -138.3 degrees Celsius. The addition of a methyl group typically increases the melting point because of greater molecular weight and van der Waals forces; this usually results in a modest increase, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group, by contrast, has a much more substantial effect due to its greatly electronegative nature and its capacity for strong dipole-dipole interactions. The nitro group can be expected to raise the melting point significantly, estimated at +230 degrees Celsius, reflecting the strong intermolecular forces. Sorting these effects into an aggregated melting point prediction provides a value that should closely align with the actual melting point of the compound.",
