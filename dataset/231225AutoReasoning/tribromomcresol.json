        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is phenol, which has a melting point of around 41\u00b0C. The substitution of hydrogens in phenol with bromine atoms generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular van der Waals forces. Each bromine substituent can be considered to add roughly +15\u00b0C to the melting point. The methyl group in m-cresol has a slight tendency to increase the melting point compared with phenol, let's estimate this increase as about +5\u00b0C. Since there are three bromines and one methyl group, the additive effect would be 3*(+15) from the bromines and +5 from the methyl group.",
