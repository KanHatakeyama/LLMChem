        "Reason": "The basic unit to consider here is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The effects of the substituents on benzene can be considered as follows: - The aldehyde (-CHO) group tends to decrease the melting point due to its dipolar nature and the fact it does not favor crystal packing, so we can estimate a -20-degree shift. - Ether groups (+OC2H5) typically increase the melting point because they introduce more mass and some polarity. Each ether functional group can be estimated to add +15 degrees to the melting point. - There are two ether groups in the molecule, so the combined effect is an increase of 30 degrees. Combining these influences: 5.5 (benzene's melting point) - 20 (aldehyde's influence) + 30 (two ether groups) = 15.5 degrees Celsius",
