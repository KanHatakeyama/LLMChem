        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5 degrees Celsius (42 Fahrenheit). Each bromine atom contributes to an increase in melting point due to its large atomic size and significant contribution to intermolecular forces such as London dispersion forces; this could be estimated as +20 for each bromine. The two methyl groups would also increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but the effect is less significant than that of bromine; this could be estimated as +5 for each methyl group. Summing these effects: Basic benzene at 5.5 + Bromines (2*20) + Methyls (2*5), we get an estimated increase.",
