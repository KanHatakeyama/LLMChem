        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be taken as phosphoramidic dichloride with a melting point around 0 \u00b0C. The various functional groups attached to this basic unit would influence the melting point of cyclophosphamide. The presence of two -NCCCl groups would significantly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and formation of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds these groups can partake in. The -O-P(O)(NH) moiety where the oxygen is bonded to phosphorus could also engage in hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point. Predictively, each -NCCCl may increase the melting point by around 20-25 degrees due to their mass and hydrogen bonding potential, while the -O-P(O)(NH) moiety may add another 5-10 degrees due to possible hydrogen bonding.",
