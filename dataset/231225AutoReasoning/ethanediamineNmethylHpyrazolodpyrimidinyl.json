        "Reason": "The compound in question is a derivative of the heterocyclic aromatic compound with multiple functional groups that can affect its melting point. The basic unit we can consider here as a reference is pyrazole, which has a melting point of about 70\u00b0C. The substituents on the pyrazole ring are expected to influence the melting point as follows:\n- Pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine structure: this bicyclic structure adds rigidity to the molecule, increasing the melting point significantly. Estimating an increase of +130\u00b0C due to enhanced pi stacking and hydrogen bonding within the bicyclic system.\n- Methyl group: generally, adding a small alkyl group like a methyl can slightly raise the melting point due to a minor increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Estimate an increase of +5\u00b0C.\n- Ethane-1,2-diamine chain: the introduction of an amine group usually increases the melting point due to the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. With two amines, this effect is amplified. Estimate an increase of about +90\u00b0C for both amines.\nThe predicted melting point will be the sum of the reference pyrazole melting point and the estimated increases due to the functional groups.",
        "Prediction": "70 (pyrazole base) + 130 (pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidinyl increase) + 5 (methyl group) + 90 (ethane-1,2-diamine chain) = 295\u00b0C",
