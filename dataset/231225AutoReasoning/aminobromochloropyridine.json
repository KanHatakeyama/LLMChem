        "Reason": "The basic unit pyridine has a melting point of 17. The amino group (\u2013NH2) is a polar substituent that can engage in hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point significantly, thus we can approximate this to raise the melting point by +90. Bromo (\u2013Br) and chloro (\u2013Cl) substituents are heavy halogens that can add to the van der Waals forces in the molecule; bromine is larger and can have a larger effect, so the estimated increase can be +20 for bromine and +15 for chlorine. The combined effects of the substituents will be additive. The electronegativity difference between N, Br, and Cl in close proximity can lead to stronger intermolecular interactions, but this effect is already encapsulated in the halogen and amino group contributions.",
        "Prediction": "17 (for pyridine) + 90 (for \u2013NH2) + 20 (for \u2013Br) + 15 (for \u2013Cl) = 142",

        "Reason": "The basic unit pyridine has a melting point of 17\u00b0C. The presence of an amino group (\u2013NH2) contributes to an increase in melting point through the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can raise the melting point substantially. Given that amino groups can have a strong effect due to hydrogen bonding, an estimated increase of about +60\u00b0C is reasonable. The bromo (\u2013Br) and chloro (\u2013Cl) substituents are bulky halogens that will increase the molecular weight and enhance the van der Waals forces. Bromine, being larger than chlorine, would have a somewhat stronger effect. An estimated increase can be +10\u00b0C for bromine and +5\u00b0C for chlorine. The prediction involves the additive effects of these substituents on the base melting point of pyridine.",
        "Prediction": "17 (for pyridine) + 60 (for \u2013NH2) + 10 (for \u2013Br) + 5 (for \u2013Cl) = 92\u00b0C",
