        "Reason": "The compound 4-fluoro-3-nitroaniline contains several functional groups that influence its melting point: \n- The basic unit, aniline, has a melting point of approximately -6 degrees Celsius. \n- The fluoro substituent is an electron-withdrawing group and typically raises the melting point of aromatic compounds due to increased molecular stability via its inductive effect; for fluorine on an aromatic ring, estimate an increase of around +20 degrees Celsius. \n- The nitro group is also strongly electron-withdrawing and has a similar inductive effect as the fluoro group, but it is also a large bulky group which significantly raises the melting point due to steric hindrance and intermolecular attraction; for a nitro group on an aromatic ring, estimate an increase of around +80 degrees Celsius. \n- The additional electron-withdrawing effects and hydrogen bonding capabilities due to the amino (NH2) group in ortho or para positions to the nitro group would typically increase the melting point as well. However, we may account for a smaller increase since it is already factored in the base aniline structure; estimate an increase of around +5 degrees Celsius.",
        "Prediction": "Expected melting point change for 4-fluoro-3-nitroaniline: \n- Aniline base unit: -6 \n- Fluoro group effect: +20 \n- Nitro group effect: +80 \n- Amino group effect (considering it as already in aniline): +5 \n- Predicted melting point: (-6) + 20 + 80 + 5 = 99 degrees Celsius",
