        "Reason": "Starting with benzoic acid which has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius, the introduction of each functional group will affect this value. Each nitro group will increase the melting point significantly due to the strong intermolecular interactions it introduces, including dipoles and possible hydrogen bonding with the carboxylic group. Estimating an increase of about 30 degrees Celsius per nitro group gives us an increase of 60 degrees. The methyl group will increase the molecular weight and thus increase van der Waals forces lightly, which is estimated to increase the melting point by about 5 degrees Celsius. The combined effects lead to an estimated increase of 65 degrees Celsius from the benzoic acid starting point.",

        "Reason": "Starting with the base structure of benzoic acid with a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius, the addition of substituent groups will alter this value. Each nitro group is likely to significantly increase the melting point due to the introduction of strong dipolar interactions and the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions with the carboxylic acid group. An increase of roughly 40 degrees Celsius for each nitro group is estimated, yielding an additional 80 degrees. The introduction of a methyl group should slightly increase the melting point due to the additional van der Waals interactions brought on by the increase in molecular weight, estimated at about a 5 degree Celsius increase. Summing these alterations provides a total estimated increase of 85 degrees Celsius.",
