        "Reason": "The basic unit for methyl salicylate is benzene which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The following functional group adjustments are applied: Hydroxy group: -40\u00b0C (hydrogen bonding and increased polarity generally lower the melting point), Ester group (combination of acyl and alkoxy): +25\u00b0C (esterification generally increases melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions), 1,3-disubstitution pattern on benzene: -3\u00b0C (provides slight steric hindrance which can disrupt the crystal lattice, thus slightly lowering the melting point).",
