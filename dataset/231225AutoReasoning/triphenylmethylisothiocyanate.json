        "Reason": "The compound triphenylmethyl isothiocyanate consists of three phenyl groups attached to a central carbon which is also connected to an isothiocyanate group (-N=C=S). The basic unit is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of phenyl groups will increase the molecular weight and surface area, thus increasing the van der Waals forces, which usually results in a higher melting point. Each phenyl group can be approximated to increase the melting point by about 20-30\u00b0C due to these influences. The isothiocyanate group has polar character and participates in dipole-dipole interactions, which would increase the melting point further, approximately by 30-40\u00b0C due to its strong electronegative difference between nitrogen and sulfur. The cumulative effect of three phenyl and one isothiocyanate group is therefore substantial.",
        "Prediction": "5.5 (benzene) + 3*(20 to 30) (phenyl groups) + (30 to 40) (isothiocyanate group) = 125.5 to 145.5\u00b0C",
