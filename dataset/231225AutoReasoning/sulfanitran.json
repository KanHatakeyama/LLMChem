        "Reason": "Sulfanitran consists of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) attached to an aromatic ring, nitro groups (-NO2), and an amide group (-CONH-). The sulfonamide and amide groups are polar and can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which substantially increases the melting point. The nitro groups also contribute to the polarity and resonance stability of the molecule, potentially increasing the melting point. Aromatic rings provide a degree of rigidity and planarity to the molecule, also contributing to higher melting points through effective stacking and van der Waals interactions. For prediction purposes, we can consider similar aromatic amines with sulfonamide groups to have a high baseline melting point, and then add the effects of the additional functional groups. A rough estimate per type of functional group based on known compounds is as follows: Aromatic amine with sulfonamide group: +160\u00b0C, nitro group: +30\u00b0C for each (two groups: +60\u00b0C), amide group: +20\u00b0C.",
