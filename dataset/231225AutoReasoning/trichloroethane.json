Each chlorine atom in a molecule generally increases the molecular weight and the polarizability, which results in a rise in the melting point due to stronger London dispersion forces and possible dipole-dipole interactions. However, the introduction of chlorine also increases the molecular asymmetry, which can lower the melting point due to less efficient packing in the solid state. For 1,1,2-trichloroethane: - First chlorine substitution: +60\u00b0C (assuming a large increase due to substantial molecular weight gain and polarity introduced) - Second chlorine substitution on the same carbon: +20\u00b0C (diminished effect due to sterics and less symmetry) - Third chlorine on an adjacent carbon: +32\u00b0C (similar to the first in terms of electronic effects, but slightly lesser due to increased asymmetry and possible steric hindrance) We also need to adjust our prediction taking into account that the overall structure is still quite compact, and thus substantial deviations in packing efficiency might be muted.",

The asymmetry caused by the uneven distribution of chlorine atoms discourages efficient packing, likely moderating the melting point rises.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for 1,1,2-trichloroethane can be considered as ethane, which has a melting point of -183.3 degrees Celsius. Each chloro functional group will raise the melting point relative to ethane due to increased molecular weight and enhanced van der Waals forces. However, the overall shape of the molecule remains fairly symmetrical, not drastically affecting the melting point. Given that each chloro group is similar, we can estimate an incremental increase per chloro group. If we estimate an increment of +49 degrees Celsius per chloro group, for three chloro groups, the total increase would be +147 degrees Celsius.",
