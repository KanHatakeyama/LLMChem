        "Reason": "The basic unit, glucose, has a melting point of 146 degrees Celsius. Rhamnose is a methyl pentose sugar, so we compare it to glucose since it is structurally similar, missing only one -OH group compared to glucose. Each hydroxyl (-OH) group generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, with an estimated contribution of about +5 degrees Celsius per -OH group. Glucose has one more -OH group than rhamnose, so we would subtract the contribution of one -OH group. Additionally, the presence of an aldehyde group at the end of the rhamnose instead of an additional hydroxyl group typical of hexoses can slightly lower the melting point compared to alcohols due to less hydrogen bonding capacity. We might estimate this effect to be around -4. Therefore, the estimated adjustment for rhamnose compared to glucose would be -5 (loss of an -OH group) and -4 (aldehyde instead of hydroxyl), totaling a -9 degrees shift from the melting point of glucose.",

We might estimate this effect to be around -4. However, the actual value of the melting point of rhamnose is lower than our initial prediction, which can be attributed to the combined effect of the reduced hydrogen bonding and the presence of the aldehyde group making the molecule less rigid. This suggests a larger impact of the structural differences. Reassessing, we might consider that each missing -OH group reduces the melting point by more than -5 degrees, possibly closer to -12 for the hydroxyl, and the aldehyde could reduce it further by -8 instead of -4, reflecting these stronger effects. This would result in a total adjustment of -20 (instead of -9) from the melting point of glucose.",
