        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is phthalic anhydride, which has a melting point of 131\u00b0C. The methyl group, which usually lowers the melting point due to the reduction of symmetry and potential disruption of the crystal lattice, is expected to lower the melting point by approximately -15\u00b0C. Additionally, the anhydride functional group, which tends to have high melting points due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and rigid structure, is already accounted for in the basic unit.",
