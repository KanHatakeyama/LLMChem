        "Reason": "Basic unit, 1,3,5-triazine has a melting point of 81\u00b0C. Each trifluoromethyl (CF3) group contributes a decrease in melting point due to the introduction of highly electronegative fluorine atoms which weaken the crystal lattice by disrupting \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions typically present in aromatic systems. This is counterintuitive as fluorine\u2019s strong inductive effect often increases melting point in other types of compounds. For 1,3,5-triazine, the effect of each trifluoromethyl group is around -35\u00b0C. Thus, for three CF3 groups, the total decrease is approximately -105\u00b0C.",
