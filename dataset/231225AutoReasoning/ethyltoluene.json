        "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, the addition of the methyl group in toluene lowers the melting point to -95 degrees Celsius due to increased methyl rotation which destabilizes the crystal structure. An ethyl group, which is present in 3-ethyltoluene, has a slightly larger impact on melting point than a methyl group because its larger size and greater rotational freedom can disrupt the crystalline structure even more. Therefore, the introduction of an ethyl group to toluene is expected to further decrease the melting point. The specific impact of an ethyl group over a methyl group on the melting point can be estimated at about -5 degrees Celsius because of these factors.",
