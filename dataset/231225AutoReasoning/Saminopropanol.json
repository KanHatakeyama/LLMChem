        "Reason": "The compound (2S)-1-amino-2-propanol (SMILES: C[C@@H](CN)O) has several functional groups that will affect its melting point. Starting with propane as the base hydrocarbon structure with a typical melting point around -187.7 degrees Celsius. The addition of a hydroxyl (-OH) group generally increases the melting point due to the capability of forming hydrogen bonds, which could be estimated as a +200 increase. The amino group (-NH2) also forms hydrogen bonds and could contribute a similar amount of increase in melting point, estimated around +200. However, these effects are mitigated by the fact that intramolecular hydrogen bonding can occur between the -OH and -NH2 groups, which might restrict their ability to engage in extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Thus, the melting point rise due to hydrogen bonding may not be as steep as in compounds where such intramolecular bonds are not possible. Given the steric hindrance and the potential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the combined effects of the -OH and -NH2 might not add up linearly. Therefore, a more conservative combined increase might be on the order of +210 degrees Celsius.",
