        "Reason": "The target compound 5-methylnicotinic acid is structurally similar to nicotinic acid whose melting point is around 234-237 degrees Celsius. The additional methyl group normally raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and a slight increase in van der Waals forces. However, the methyl group also adds steric hindrance, which can interfere with the packing of the molecules, possibly lowering the melting point. In this case, due to the position of the methyl group, it has a smaller effect on the molecular packing than if it were in a position to interfere more directly with the hydrogen bonding of the carboxylic acid. Therefore the influence on the melting point might be less. Hence, the presence of the methyl group might slightly depress the melting point from that of nicotinic acid. In estimating the effect, the methyl group might depress the melting point by about -20 to -25 degrees Celsius.",
