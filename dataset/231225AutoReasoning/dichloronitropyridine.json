        "Reason": "For 2,6-dichloro-3-nitropyridine the melting point prediction is based on the following assessments: - Basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of -42\u00b0C. - Chloro groups: Each chloro group adds to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and dipole-induced dipole interactions. Each chlorine is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 90\u00b0C based on similar aromatic chlorinated compounds. - Nitro group: The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group which increases intermolecular forces due to dipoles, adding to the melting point. The addition of the nitro group can be expected to increase the melting point by about 40\u00b0C, based on similar compound data. - In total, the two chloro groups would add 180\u00b0C and the nitro group would add 40\u00b0C to the base melting point of pyridine. Therefore, the expected melting point shift would be 220\u00b0C.",
