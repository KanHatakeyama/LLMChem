        "Reason": "The target compound 4-vinylcyclohexene has two functional groups to consider: the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group. The base structure, cyclohexane, has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a double bond in the cyclohexene decreases the melting point due to less effective van der Waals forces compared to alkanes, as pi bonds are less 'stackable' than sigma bonds, offering a rough estimate of -20 degrees Celsius. The vinyl group, being an alkene, also reduces the melting point as it provides planar geometry and reduced symmetry compared to saturated groups, but it does have some hyperconjugation that may offer slight stabilization adding -5 degrees Celsius. The combined effects of the unsaturated groups result in an overall decrease in the melting point.",
