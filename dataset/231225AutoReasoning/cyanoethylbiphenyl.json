        "Reason": "The compound 4-cyano-4'-ethylbiphenyl is based on biphenyl, which has a melting point of 70 \u00b0C. The cyano group (-C#N) is an electron-withdrawing group that increases intermolecular forces through dipole-dipole interaction, raising the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C. The ethyl group (CH2CH3) is a electron-donating and hydrophobic alkyl chain which typically decreases the melting point due to less effective intermolecular interactions compared to aromatic moieties; this could lower the melting point by around -15 \u00b0C. Combining these effects gives a predicted melting point that is close to the actual value.",
