        "Reason": "The target compound isononene has a carbon chain length of 9 with one C=C double bond. Starting with the basic unit, ethane (C2H6), which has a melting point around -183\u00b0C, each additional -CH2- group usually increases the melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C as the Vander Waals forces increase due to larger surface area. However, the presence of a double bond usually reduces the melting point due to less-efficient packing compared to saturated hydrocarbons. For a non-branched alkene this reduction can be estimated around -30\u00b0C as compared to its saturated counterpart. Thus, starting from ethane and adding seven more -CH2- groups (7 groups * 20\u00b0C/group = 140\u00b0C increment) and then considering the double bond, we reach our final prediction.",
