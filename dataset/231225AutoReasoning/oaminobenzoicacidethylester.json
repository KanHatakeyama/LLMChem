        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of o-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, we need to consider the effects of the different functional groups present in the molecule compared to a reference compound, which in this case can be benzene with a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Benzene's ring provides base stability, but each additional functional group affects the melting point in various ways. The amino group (NH2) typically increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities, whereas an ester group generally has a lower impact on the melting point than a carboxylic acid. The substitution pattern on the benzene ring also plays a role; ortho substitution can lead to stronger intermolecular forces (in the case of polar groups like NH2), raising the melting point. However, steric hinderance could also lead to a decrease in the potential for effective hydrogen bonding. The presence of the ester in place of the more hydrogen-bonding capable carboxylic acid decreases the possible intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, leading to a lower melting point than if the acid were present. Therefore, the amino group could contribute an increase of about +80 degrees Celsius due to enhanced hydrogen bonding potential, but the formation of an ester from the acid might reduce this by about -72 degrees Celsius due to a decrease in hydrogen bonding ability.",
