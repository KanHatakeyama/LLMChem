        "Reason": "The basic unit methane has a melting point of -182.5\u00b0C. The fluorination of the hydrogens results in a higher melting point due to the polarity and the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond compared to the carbon-hydrogen bond. Each fluorine is estimated to add around +20\u00b0C due to these effects. However, since there is one hydrogen left in the structure, we don't have complete fluorination which would maximize the melting point. Therefore, the increment is slightly lower than the theoretical maximum per fluorine atom. The addition of four fluorine atoms would thus contribute approximately +80\u00b0C in total.",
