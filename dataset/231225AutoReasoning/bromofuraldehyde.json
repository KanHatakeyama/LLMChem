        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is furan with a melting point of -85.6 \u00b0C. The addition of an aldehyde group increases polarity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, typically raising the melting point significantly, let's estimate this effect to be +100. The presence of a bromine atom increases the molecular weight and size, providing additional van der Waals interactions, which we can estimate as adding another +40 to the melting point. The combined effect of these groups is expected to raise the melting point from furan's base of -85.6 \u00b0C.",
