        "Reason": "The target compound 2,5-difluorobenzonitrile consists of a benzene ring as the basic unit, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Adding a nitrile (cyano) group generally increases the melting point by approximately 20.5 degrees Celsius due to the increase in polarity and potential for intermolecular dipole interactions. Each fluorine substituent on the benzene ring is also likely to increase the melting point due to the high electronegativity of fluorine, which increases intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. The influence of a single fluorine atom can be approximated as an increase of 3.5 degrees Celsius. With two fluorine atoms, the combined effect would be an increase of 7.0 degrees Celsius. Thus, the combined predicted increase from the functional groups is 20.5 (for the cyano group) + 7.0 (for two fluorine atoms) = 27.5 degrees Celsius.",
