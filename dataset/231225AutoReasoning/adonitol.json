        "Reason": "Adonitol is a sugar alcohol derived from ribose, containing five hydroxyl (OH) groups. Considering the effects of various functional groups on the melting point: Basic unit, methane which is the lowest hydrocarbon has a melting point of -182. Alcohols have notably higher melting points due to the ability of the hydroxyl (-OH) groups to form hydrogen bonds. Each -OH group would greatly increase the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Starting with methane as a simple hydrocarbon (-182), adding the effect of each -OH group (+56 per -OH group due to hydrogen bonding, taking into account diminishing returns as the molecule gets larger), we have a total of five -OH groups to consider. The aliphatic carbon chain also contributes to an increase in the melting point, as it adds to the molecule's van der Waals forces. However, due to the high impact of hydrogen bonding from the hydroxyl groups, this contribution might be relatively minor (+5 for the carbon chain).",
