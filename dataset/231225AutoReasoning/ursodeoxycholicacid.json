        "Reason": "Ursodeoxycholic acid is a complex molecule with several functional groups that affect its melting point. The starting point is cholic acid, which has a melting point of about 200-201\u00b0C. Ursodeoxycholic acid has a similar structure with minor differences that affect its melting point: \n- Hydroxy groups (-OH): Each hydroxy group generally increases melting point due to hydrogen bonding, but the presence of several hydroxy groups in ursodeoxycholic acid (4 in total) have already been accounted for in the base structure of cholic acid. \n- Carboxylic acid group (\u2013COOH): As part of the acid function in the steroid, this group is capable of strong hydrogen bonding, which would generally increase melting point. However, this is also a feature shared with cholic acid and therefore does not provide a differential effect. \nStereochemistry: The specific 3D arrangement and chiral centers present in ursodexycholic acid may slightly influence the melting point as compared to cholic acid by affecting the packing of the molecules in the solid state. However, as these are also present in cholic acid, the effect would be minimal and is included in the starting point of cholic acid's melting point. \nConsidering these factors, the prediction would be that ursodeoxycholic acid has a melting point very close to that of cholic acid, with slight variations possibly due to minor structural differences and impurities in the sample. Since cholic acid has a melting point around 200-201\u00b0C and these effects are minimal, the predicted melting point for ursodeoxycholic acid should be very close to this range.",
