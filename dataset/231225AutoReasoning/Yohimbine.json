        "Reason": "The target compound is yohimbine, a complex indole alkaloid with multiple ring structures and several polar functional groups. The base unit for comparison might be indole itself, which has a melting point of about 52 degrees Celsius. The complex aromatic structure and multiple chiral centers will significantly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight, intermolecular pi-stacking, and hydrogen bonding. Substituent groups can notably influence the melting point: -OH groups: +40 each (2 groups, due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, so +80 total), -O-CO- group: +60 (due to the polar nature and the possibility of hydrogen bonding). Additional steric hindrance and the extended polycyclic system can increase the melting point further by +50. Collectively, these modifications contribute to a substantial increase from the base structure's melting point.",

        "Reason": "The target compound yohimbine is a complex molecule with several ring structures and functional groups that increase its melting point relative to simpler aromatic compounds like indole, which has a melting point around 52 degrees Celsius. Yohimbine possesses multiple -OH groups which can engage in strong hydrogen bonding, significantly raising its melting point by about +40 degrees Celsius for each hydroxyl group, resulting in an increase of +80 degrees Celsius in total. The ester (-O-CO-) linkage also contributes to the melting point elevation because of its polarity and capacity for intermolecular interactions, estimated to raise the melting point by about +60 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the extended polycyclic system and stereochemical complexity not only add to the molecular weight but also to the intermolecular forces such as pi-stacking interactions and van der Waals forces, collectively estimated to contribute an additional +50 degrees Celsius to the melting point of yohimbine. These individual effects combine to predict the actual melting point.",
