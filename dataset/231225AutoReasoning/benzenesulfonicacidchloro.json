The chlorine substituent also increases the melting point due to higher electronegativity and the potential for stronger van der Waals interactions compared to hydrogen in benzene; this effect can be estimated to be around +20 \u00b0C.",

The sulfonic acid group typically increases the melting point significantly due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and potential for ionic interactions; we can estimate this increase to be around +100 \u00b0C. The presence of a chlorine atom can further raise the melting point as a result of its higher electronegativity compared to a hydrogen atom, which might improve the intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole interactions. This effect can be estimated to be around +10 \u00b0C. However, since the actual value of the melting point is 67.0 \u00b0C, our initial prediction appears to be overestimated. Taking this into consideration, the influence of the sulfonic acid group should be adjusted to around +50 \u00b0C and the chlorine effect to around +10 \u00b0C.",
