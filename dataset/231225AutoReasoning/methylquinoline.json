Adding a methyl group to position 4 generally increases the melting point due to a small increase in molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals forces. However, the additional steric hindrance does not significantly alter the planarity nor the overall polarity of the molecule, making the increase in melting point relatively minor.

The increase is relatively minor as the steric hindrance introduced by a methyl group in position 4 of the aromatic quinoline system does not significantly affect the planarity or the overall polarity of the molecule.
