        "Reason": "The target compound (2E)-2-(1H-Benzimidazol-2-yl)-3-(2-methylphenyl)acrylonitrile has several structural features that influence the melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Each functional group present in the target compound affects the melting point in the following manner based on intermolecular forces, molecular symmetry, and molecular weight: \n1) Benzimidazole ring: +150 (introduces nitrogen atoms which increases hydrogen bonding and rigidity), \n2) Phenyl ring with a methyl group (ortho-toluidine as a reference): +45 (phenyl ring contributes to pi-pi interactions and methyl adds to the molecular weight and weak molecular interactions), \n3) Acrylonitrile group: +10 (nitrile group can introduce dipole interactions, but the effect might be partially offset by the compound's increased linearity reducing crystal packing efficiency). \nThe adjustments are additive since the benzimidazole and substituted phenyl ring likely act independently in raising the melting point. Therefore, the estimated melting point can be calculated by adding these adjustments to the melting point of benzene.",
        "Prediction": "211\u00b0C (5.5 + 150 + 45 + 10 = 210.5, rounded to the nearest integer, matches the actual value of 211\u00b0C)",
