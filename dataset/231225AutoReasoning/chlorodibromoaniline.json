        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-chloro-4,6-dibromoaniline is aniline, which has a melting point of approximately 6 degrees Celsius. Adding halogens such as bromine and chlorine to the aromatic ring typically increases the melting point due to the following: 1. Increased molecular weight due to the addition of bromine (+40 for each Br, given that bromine is significantly larger and heavier than hydrogen) and chlorine atoms (+10 for Cl, given that chlorine is smaller than bromine but still adds to the molecular weight). 2. Increased intermolecular forces due to polarizability of the halogens, leading to stronger London dispersion forces. 3. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of halogens, especially on ortho and para positions to the amino group, creates stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds (due to more acidic NH which can form stronger hydrogen bonds). However, steric hindrance from the substituents in ortho positions might slightly lower the melting point because it can disrupt crystal packing. We estimate this effect to be relatively small compared to the overall increase from electron-withdrawing and increased molecular weight (+5 to account for slight disruption in packing). The additive bromine contribution is actually offset by the chlorine atom substitution. Thus, overall we predict an increase from the basic aniline unit: Aniline melting point (6) + 2Br (+80) + Cl (+10) + NH hydrogen bonding and polarizability increase (+4) - steric hindrance (-5) = 95 degrees Celsius.",
