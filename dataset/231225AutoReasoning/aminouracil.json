        "Reason": "The target compound, 6-aminouracil, consists of a uracil base which is a planar, aromatic molecule, similar to the structure of pyrimidine. Pyrimidine has a melting point around 20\u201322\u00b0C. The functional groups on 6-aminouracil would significantly change this value. Each amine group (NH2) in aromatic amines typically raises the melting point by approximately 80-100\u00b0C due to increased hydrogen bonding capability. The molecule has one amine group, which we consider to provide a +90\u00b0C effect. The carbonyl groups (C=O) in amides or similar environments can also increase melting points by around 70-90\u00b0C due to strong dipole interactions and the possibility of hydrogen bonding. Since we have two such groups in 6-aminouracil, the combined effect is considered double that of one, thus approximately +170\u00b0C to the baseline pyrimidine melting point. Therefore, we would expect the functional groups in 6-aminouracil to add approximately 260\u00b0C to the baseline melting point of pyrimidine.",

        "Reason": "The melting point of a compound depends on several factors, including molecular weight, molecular structure, intermolecular forces, and the presence of functional groups. To predict the melting point of 6-aminouracil, we need to look at its structural components and compare them with known substances. The base structure here is uracil, which has a melting point of around 335\u00b0C. Adding an amino group to uracil is likely to increase the melting point due to the possibility of forming stronger hydrogen bonds, which increases the thermal stability of a compound. Each amino group typically increases the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding by approximately 20-25\u00b0C. Thus, comparing to uracil, 6-aminouracil should have a slightly higher melting point due to this additional amino group.",
