        "Reason": "For predicting the melting point of nitrocyclohexane, we need to consider the effects of both the cyclohexane ring and the nitro group. Cyclohexane, as a simple saturated hydrocarbon, has a relatively low melting point because it is not very polar and has a fairly symmetrical shape which packs well in the solid state. The melting point of pure cyclohexane is 6.5\u00b0C. The nitro group, however, is highly electronegative and introduces some polarity to the molecule. This can increase the melting point, as molecules with polar functional groups generally have higher melting points due to stronger intermolecular forces (like dipole-dipole interactions). On the other hand, the nitro group also introduces steric hindrance and disrupts the symmetry of the molecule, which can decrease the melting point by preventing efficient packing in the solid state. In this case, it appears the polarity effect is not enough to raise the melting point above room temperature and the negative inductive effects along with steric hindrance lowers the melting point significantly. A rough estimate for the change due to the nitro group based on similar compounds would be approximately -40\u00b0C, combining this with the base melting point of cyclohexane allows us to make an educated guess.",
