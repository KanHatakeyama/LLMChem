        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The following functional group contributions can be considered: the bromine substituent increases the melting point due to its significant mass and polarizability, estimated at about +80\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group, being highly electronegative and introducing strong dipole-dipole interactions, also raises the melting point, estimated at +50\u00b0C. Finally, the benzenesulfonamide moiety is a large polar group capable of strong intermolecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding, which would significantly raise the melting point, estimated at +100\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Introducing a bromine atom to the benzene ring adds significant mass and enhances the polarizability of the molecule, which is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group is highly electronegative and can introduce strong dipole-dipole interactions, which would be estimated to contribute an additional +20\u00b0C to the melting point. The benzenesulfonamide group is a large, polar functional group capable of engaging in intermolecular hydrogen bonding and can be expected to provide a substantial increase in the melting point, estimated at around +50\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. A bromine atom, being a large, electron-withdrawing group, typically raises the melting point significantly due to increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular interactions (+60 \u00b0C). The trifluoromethyl group is highly electronegative and also increases the melting point due to the polar nature of the C\u2013F bonds and the additional fluoro substituents' influence on the solid-state lattice (+40 \u00b0C). Lastly, the sulfonamide group adds substantial polar character and ability to form hydrogen bonds, leading to a strong increase in the melting point (+80 \u00b0C). The combined effect of these groups on benzene is expected to give a substantial cumulative increase in the melting point.",
