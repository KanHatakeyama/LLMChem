        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 2-bromo-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzenesulfonamide, we need to consider the influence of its functional groups based on the base structure of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of a sulfonamide group (SO2NH2) will significantly increase the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the possibility of dimerization, adding about +140\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl (CF3) group increases the melting point due to the strong electronegative fluorine atoms introducing dipole-dipole interactions and increasing the molecular rigidity, adding approximately +20\u00b0C. The bromine atom increases the molecular weight and the polarizability, further raising the melting point by around +7\u00b0C. Combining these adjustments should yield the predicted melting point of the compound.",
