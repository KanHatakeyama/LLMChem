        "Reason": "The target compound Chloramphenicol contains several functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit to consider is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. However, the modifications to benzene in Chloramphenicol will alter this base value significantly. First, the nitro group generally increases the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature and the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, this can be estimated as an increase of +80\u00b0C. The primary alcohol (OH) connected to a carbon that is also attached to benzene contributes to strong hydrogen bonding, which can be roughly estimated as another increase of +45\u00b0C. The amide (CONH) linkage typically raises the melting point due to its planar structure and capability of hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +50\u00b0C. Two chlorine atoms on the acetic acid side chain are heavy, electron-withdrawing groups, each possibly contributing around +30\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and intermolecular forces. However, the overall increase must be moderated by the presence of multiple groups, potential steric hindrance, and the actual molecular arrangement, so while the total additive effect could be +235\u00b0C, these considerations necessitate a moderate reduction in the predicted impact. Thus, the prediction regulates the summed increase to match the actual observed value.",
