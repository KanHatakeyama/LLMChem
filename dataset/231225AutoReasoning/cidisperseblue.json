The various substituents on the benzene rings in c.i. disperse blue 3 will affect this melting point.

Each amide can increase the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding and rigid structure (+40\u00b0C each). The ether linkage has a slight increase effect due to the larger atomic size compared to a hydrogen atom (+5\u00b0C). The tertiary amine is not likely to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, but it does increase the molecular weight and steric bulk, which can slightly increase the melting point (+10\u00b0C). The additional fused aromatic rings provide further rigidity and increase the surface area for van der Waals interactions, hence we might estimate an increase of (+30\u00b0C for fused rings).

The various functional groups on the benzene rings in c.i. disperse blue 3 will affect this melting point. The molecule has several functional groups: two amide groups, an ether linkage, aromatic rings, and a tertiary amine. Each amide can substantially increase the melting point due to the possibility of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the rigidity they add to the structure (+80\u00b0C each). The ether linkage slightly increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and size, but its effect is relatively modest (+5\u00b0C). The tertiary amine is less capable of hydrogen bonding than amides due to the absence of the hydrogen, but its presence increases molecular weight and steric hindrance which may slightly increase the melting point (+10\u00b0C). The additional aromaticity due to the fused rings contributes to a significant increase in melting point by enhancing the van der Waals interactions, molecular planarity, and overall rigidity of the molecule (+50\u00b0C for fused rings).
