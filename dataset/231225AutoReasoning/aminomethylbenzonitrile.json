        "Reason": "The compound 2-amino-4-methylbenzonitrile contains three functional groups that can influence its melting point: a benzene ring, an amino group, and a nitrile group, as well as a methyl group. The benzene ring provides the basic unit for the melting point, and each additional functional group will affect this value. The presence of an amino group (-NH2) typically increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which requires more energy to break (+40). A nitrile group (C#N) will also raise the melting point owing to the dipole-dipole interactions and possible linear intermolecular packing (+25). A methyl group (CH3), being an alkyl group, slightly increases the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces, although the effect is not as significant as that of polar functional groups (+5). Combining these effects, we get an overall predicted increase in melting point.",
        "Prediction": "Base benzene value, estimated around 5.5 (since the actual melting point of benzene is 5.5, this serves as a reference point for a mono-substituted benzene derivative) + Amino group: +40 + Nitrile group: +25 + Methyl group: +5 = 5.5 + 40 + 25 + 5 = 75.5",

        "Reason": "The compound 2-amino-4-methylbenzonitrile contains several functional groups: a benzene ring, an amino group, a nitrile group, and a methyl group. Each of these will influence the melting point differently. The benzene ring provides a starting point for the melting point estimation. The addition of an amino group tends to significantly increase the melting point as it allows for hydrogen bonding, contributing to a stronger intermolecular force (+50). The nitrile group, with its strong dipole and the ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions, further increases the melting point (+35). The methyl group adds some, though lesser, increase due to van der Waals interactions (+5). These increments should be added to the base value of the benzene ring to predict the overall melting point.",
