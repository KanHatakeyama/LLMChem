        "Reason": "The base molecule for phenylhydroxylamine is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The hydroxylamine group (-NHOH) attached to the benzene ring is expected to increase the melting point due to the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which require additional energy to break. The presence of this group could significantly raise the melting point by approximately 80 degrees Celsius.",
