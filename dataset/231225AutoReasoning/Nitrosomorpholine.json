        "Reason": "The basic unit for 4-Nitrosomorpholine could be considered as morpholine, which has a melting point of -5 degrees Celsius as a reference point. Introducing a nitroso group (-N=O) to the 4-position is expected to increase the melting point due to the following reasons: the nitroso group participates in resonance, which stabilizes the compound, but also increases the polarity of the molecule, favoring stronger intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole forces. The nitroso group could roughly be estimated to increase the melting point by about 30-35 degrees Celsius due to these factors. Other parts of the molecule like the ether linkage or the aliphatic ring structure should not significantly affect the melting point as they do not introduce significant polarity or intermolecular forces.",
