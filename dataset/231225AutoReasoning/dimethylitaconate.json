        "Reason": "The structure of dimethyl itaconate includes two ester functional groups (C=OOC), an alkene group (C=C), and a methylene group (CH2) connected to the alkene. To predict the melting point, we will consider the effects of these functional groups relative to a base molecule. The base molecule suited for this analysis would be ethane, which has a melting point of -172\u00b0C. The modifications include: 1) The ester functional groups typically raise the melting point due to polar interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding on the carbonyl oxygens; however, since itaconate is a diester and no hydrogens are available for hydrogen bonding, we will consider only the dipole-dipole interactions and steric hindrance contributed by the ester which may influence the melting point less significantly: +40\u00b0C per ester group. 2) The presence of the alkene group in the compound will decrease the melting point since alkenes reduce symmetry and disrupt the regular packing of molecules in the crystal lattice: -5\u00b0C. 3) The methylene group connected to the alkene will have a minor influence: +1\u00b0C. Adding these changes to the base value of ethane's melting point gives the predicted melting point for dimethyl itaconate.",
