        "Reason": "The base structure of phosphates generally exhibits low melting points due to the flexibility of the hydrocarbon chains. In this bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate molecule, the presence of the phosphate group (P(=O)(O)O) would typically increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. However, the presence of long 2-ethylhexyl (C8H17-) groups, which are large, flexible, and aliphatic, likely disrupts the crystal packing and reduces intermolecular forces, thereby significantly lowering the melting point compared to smaller or more rigid alkyl groups. The 2-ethylhexyl groups can each be assumed to exert a strong negative influence on the melting point: Let's estimate this influence to be approximately -35\u00b0C for each 2-ethylhexyl group. With two such groups attached, the lowering would be roughly -70\u00b0C in total. Without these groups, if we assumed a base melting point similar to triethyl phosphate (which is around 56.5\u00b0C), adding the effects of the 2-ethylhexyl groups would lead to a substantially lowered overall melting point.",
