        "Reason": "The basic unit, ethane, has a melting point of -172. The introduction of four fluorine atoms substantially increases intermolecular forces due to the high electronegativity of fluorine, inducing stronger dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine's introduction is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately 20 degrees due to these interactions. However, the correct prediction should not linearly add these values because the proximity of fluorines on the same carbon could cause slightly lesser increases due to steric hindrance and saturation of the polar effect.",
