        "Reason": "The basic unit we will consider is styrene, which has a melting point of -30.6\u00b0C. This compound has an aldehyde group in place of one of styrene's alkenyl hydrogens. The aldehyde group is polar and introduces some dipole-dipole interactions, but it does not contribute to significant intermolecular hydrogen bonding as no H is attached to the O. Generally, an aldehyde group would increase the boiling point due to polarity but has a less pronounced effect on the melting point compared to boiling point. We can estimate the aldehyde group increases melting point around +5 to +10 degrees. Combining this with the base of styrene, we predict the melting point to be between -25.6 and -20.6\u00b0C.",
