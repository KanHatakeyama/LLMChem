        "Reason": "Base compound, benzene has a melting point of 5.5 Celsius. Each methyl group individually raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces; however, the substituents are in a 1,3,5- pattern, which allows the molecule to maintain a fairly symmetric structure and pack efficiently. The methyl groups will also slightly increase molecular weight and size. Methyl group effect on benzene's melting point is roughly +5 Celsius per group.",
