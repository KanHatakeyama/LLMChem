        "Reason": "Base structure: Androstan has a basic steroid structure which likely has a melting point in the range of 100 to 130 degrees Celsius due to its four fused rings contributing to rigidity and intermolecular interactions. Ethynyl group: +20, as the addition of a triple bond increases rigidity and molecular weight but does not contribute significantly to intermolecular interactions. Hydroxyl group: +20, as it introduces hydrogen bonding capabilities, significantly increasing the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces. Ketone group: +20, as the carbonyl group is polar and will increase the melting point due to additional dipole-dipole interactions. Overall, the combined effects of the functional groups result in an increased melting point compared to the base structure.",

Ethynyl group: +30, as the addition of a triple bond increases rigidity substantially and molecular weight, which contributes to higher melting points. Hydroxyl group: +40, as it introduces significant hydrogen bonding capabilities, greatly increasing the melting point due to much stronger intermolecular forces. Ketone group: +30, as the carbonyl group is polar and will significantly increase the melting point due to additional dipole-dipole interactions and some hydrogen bonding potentials. The combined effects of these functional groups will result in an increased melting point compared to the base structure. Given that the actual value is 238 Celsius, the predicted contributions from the functional groups must be higher than initially estimated to match this value.",
