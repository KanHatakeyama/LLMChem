        "Reason": "The structural components that influence the melting point of Methyl butyrate are as follows: the basic unit (-CH3) has a melting point around -183 degrees Celsius. The butyrate moiety (butyl group attached to a carbonyl and ester oxygen) has functional groups that increase the molecular weight and provides some dipole-dipole interactions, but overall, esters have lower melting points compared to carboxylic acids due to the lack of strong hydrogen bonding. The butyl group typically raises the melting point in comparison to a methyl group due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but when attached to an ester, the influence is moderate. Estimating an increase of around 10 degrees for the butyrate group over the base methyl group due to increased molecular size, and the ester group (which might generally decrease the melting point relative to carboxylic acids by about 50 degrees), the cumulative effect might result in a melting point that is still below 0 degrees Celsius.",
