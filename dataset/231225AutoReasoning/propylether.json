        "Reason": "The target compound propyl ether has a backbone of a six-carbon chain with an ether (-O-) functional group in the center, which is derived from a propane (-CH2CH2CH2-) with an additional oxygen (-O-). The standard reference point for the melting point comparison should be butane, which is the closest simpler alkane with a melting point of \u2212140 \u00b0C. For the ether oxygen, we consider that ethers generally have slightly higher melting points than the comparable alkanes due to the dipole-dipole interactions introduced by the oxygen atom. We estimate an increase of about +5 \u00b0C for the introduction of the oxygen atom in the middle of the chain. Additionally, there is an extension of the carbon chain from four to six carbons. This can slightly increase the melting point due to higher van der Waals forces. Each additional -CH2- group might contribute an estimated +2 \u00b0C to the melting point. Therefore, with two additional -CH2- groups comparing to butane, an additional +4 \u00b0C can be estimated. Thus, the expected change is +5 \u00b0C from the ether oxygen and +4 \u00b0C from the two additional carbons.",
