        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-aminobenzimidazole is benzimidazole, which itself is derived from benzene (whose melting point is 5.5 \u00b0C). Benzimidazole has a higher melting point due to the presence of nitrogen in the heterocyclic ring which allows for hydrogen bonding and increased ring stability, typically adding a substantial increment. Benzimidazole's melting point is 170 \u00b0C. Then we have an amino group attached to the benzimidazole. The amino group (\u2013NH2) will contribute to an increased melting point due to potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The presence of an additional nitrogen atom in the amino group also increases the molecular weight and polarity, and this typically increases the melting point by approximately 40-60 \u00b0C over benzimidazole.",
