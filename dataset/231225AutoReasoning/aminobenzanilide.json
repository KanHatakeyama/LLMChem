        "Reason": "The compound 2-aminobenzanilide comprises two functional groups that would influence its melting point: the amide group (-CONH-) and the amino group (-NH2). Starting with the basic unit of benzene which has a melting point around 5.5 degrees Celsius, the following considerations are made: 1) The amide group is known for strong hydrogen bonding due to the presence of both a carbonyl (C=O) and an N-H bond, which significantly increases the melting point. This effect can be estimated to increase the melting point by about 80 degrees Celsius. 2) The amino group also contributes to hydrogen bonding, although to a lesser extent than the amide. It can raise the melting point by approximately 40 degrees Celsius. 3) Having two aromatic rings increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which also raises the melting point; this effect can be estimated at around 30 degrees Celsius. 4) A second amino group is present but it is part of the amide, so its contribution to the melting point has already been counted once and should not be double-counted.",

        "Reason": "The compound 2-aminobenzanilide is made of several functional groups and structural features, each affecting its melting point. Baseline structure aniline has a melting point of around -6 degrees Celsius. The additional features that will modify this value are as follows: two benzene rings will significantly increase the melting point due to increased pi-pi stacking interactions and molecular rigidity (+150 degrees for both rings). The amide group also increases the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and its planar rigid structure (+50 degrees). Two amino groups also contribute to the increase through intermolecular hydrogen bonding (+20 degrees each). However, the amino groups connected to the benzene ring may slightly decrease their contribution due to reduced hydrogen bonding capacity within a conjugated system. Therefore, each amino group's effect might be a bit lower (-10 degrees in total for both). Amide and amino's contribution to the hydrogen bonding will not be merely additive because of geometric constraints possibly reducing the additional effect of the second amino group (-5 degrees).",

When considering the functional groups present in 2-aminobenzanilide, we have an amide group, two amino groups, and two phenyl rings. The amide group increases the melting point significantly due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and its planar conformation which allows for good packing in the solid state, we can estimate this contribution to be around +70 to +80\u00b0C. Each amino group can form hydrogen bonds as well, albeit less strong than the amide, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C each to the melting point. Additional phenyl rings tend to increase melting points by providing more pi-pi interactions and van der Waals forces, increasing the stability of the crystalline structure; this is estimated to contribute about +15 to +25\u00b0C for each ring beyond the first. Summing up these contributions, the predicted melting point is: 5.5 (basic benzene unit) + 70 (amide group) + 40 (two amino groups) + 50 (extra phenyl ring and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding) = 165.5\u00b0C.",
