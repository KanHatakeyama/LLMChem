        "Reason": "The basic unit for cycloheptene could be considered as cyclohexane, which has a melting point of approximately 6.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of one double bond (as found in cycloheptene) tends to decrease the melting point due to the decrease in the overall symmetry of the molecule which can impede efficient packing in the solid state, decreasing intermolecular interactions. The effect of one double bond can typically reduce the melting point by around 60 degrees Celsius.",
