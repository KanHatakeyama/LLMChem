        "Reason": "Starting with the base molecule ethane, which has a melting point of -182.8 degrees Celsius, we consider the effect of adding two chlorine atoms. Chlorides typically raise the melting point because they are highly electronegative, increasing the polarity of the molecule, leading to stronger dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine substituent on an alkane can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately 74 degrees Celsius (based on chloromethane's rise in melting point from methane).",
