        "Reason": "Starting with the basic unit, benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, we consider the adjustments made by the functional groups present in 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid:\n- Carboxylic acid group: contributes significantly to the increase in melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Typical increase would be approximately +150 degrees Celsius.\n- Two chlorine atoms: each chlorine substituent increases the melting point because of increased molecular weight and size, as well as the polar nature of the C-Cl bond. An expected increase may be around +20 degrees Celsius per chlorine atom.\nCombined, the carboxylic acid and the two chlorines are predicted to raise the melting point substantially from the base value for benzene.",
