        "Reason": "Starting with benzoic acid as a reference, which has a melting point of 122\u00b0C, the chloro substituents and their positions on the benzene ring must be considered. Each chloro group is electron-withdrawing due to its inductive effect and has a deactivating influence on the ring, which would increase the melting point due to enhanced molecular stability and stronger intermolecular interactions, including potential hydrogen bonding. Based on typical chloro substituent effects, each chloro group could be estimated to raise the melting point by roughly 20-25\u00b0C. Since there are two such groups, this would mean an additive effect. Ortho- and para-directing substituents do not influence the melting point to the same extent as meta-directing ones. However, as both chloro groups are in the meta position relative to each other, there should be a cumulative effect due to symmetry and maximized potential for intermolecular interactions.",
