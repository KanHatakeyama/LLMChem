        "Reason": "The base unit for comparison is biphenyl, which has a melting point of around 69\u00b0C. Thianthrene has a biphenyl backbone but with two sulfur atoms inserted into the structure forming a five-membered ring with each of the phenyl groups. The sulfur atoms contribute to an increase in molecular weight and size, and potentially introduce stronger van der Waals forces. Each sulfur-containing five-membered ring could increase the melting point significantly due to the larger atoms and the consequential increase in pi-pi stacking interactions between molecules. Estimating a value of +45\u00b0C for the effect of each of the two sulfur five-membered rings leads to a total predicted increase of +90\u00b0C.",
