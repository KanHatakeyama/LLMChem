        "Reason": "The target compound 5-Fluorouracil is based on the uracil structure, which itself is an unsubstituted pyrimidine. The unsubstituted pyrimidine ring has a melting point around 20-22 degrees Celsius. The effects of the substituents on the melting point are as follows: \n- Fluorine substituent: +100 (high electronegativity, which increases intermolecular forces, and the small size allows for close packing)\n- Hydroxyl groups: 2 x (+20) = +40 (hydrogen bonding increases intermolecular forces)\n- Carbonyl groups: 2 x (+50) = +100 (polarity increases intermolecular forces)\nTo predict the melting point of 5-fluorouracil, we add these contributions to the base value of pyrimidine.\n",
