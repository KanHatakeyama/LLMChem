        "Reason": "The target compound, 4-ethylbenzamide, is based on the benzene ring system. Consider the influence of each functional group on the melting point compared to benzene itself:\n- Benzene core: Benzene's own melting point serves as the base value for modifications. It has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.\n- Ethyl group: The ethyl substituent typically adds some melting point elevation due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. We can estimate this to be +15\u00b0C based on common alkyl effects on melting points.\n- Amide group (C(=O)N): The amide functional group has a significant impact on melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This typically increases the melting point substantially. Given the influence of similar amides, an estimated increase of +140\u00b0C is reasonable.\nTherefore, the combined effect of these groups is expected to raise the melting point significantly compared to benzene.",
