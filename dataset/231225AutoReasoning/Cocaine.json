        "Reason": "The molecule cocaine has several functional groups that influence its melting point. Considering the basic skeleton, the bicyclic structure provides a rigid framework, which would increase the melting point. Let us break down the contributions as follows: \n- N-methyl group: \n This could increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the introduction of a polar group, which could cause stronger intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole forces. We can estimate this to raise the melting point by +5\u00b0C. \n- Two ester groups: \n Ester functional groups generally increase the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding with traces of water. Each ester could be estimated to add another +15\u00b0C. \n- Aromatic ring: \n The presence of a phenyl group contributes to the structure's rigidity and potentially pi-pi interactions, which would further increase the melting point. We can estimate an increase of +10\u00b0C due to this group. \n- The bridged bicyclic structure: \n This characteristic structure of cocaine is likely to considerably raise the melting point due to the rigid, complex molecular arrangement that requires more energy to overcome. An approximate increase of +30\u00b0C might be expected. \nSumming these changes to an assumed base value for a simpler molecule, say benzoic acid which has a melting point of around 122\u00b0C, we would predict the melting point of cocaine to be roughly 122 + 5 (N-methyl) + 2*15 (esters) + 10 (aromatic ring) + 30 (bicyclic structure) = 197\u00b0C.",
