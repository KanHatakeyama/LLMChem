        "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by its molecular structure and the intermolecular forces present. The base unit can be considered as acrylic acid with a melting point of around 13\u00b0C. The addition of an imidazolyl group to the acrylic acid increases the melting point due to several factors: increased molecular weight, potential for hydrogen bonding, and planarity which allows for better stacking. The imidazolyl group, being a heterocycle with nitrogen atoms, can engage in hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking interactions. The effect of adding this group is significant and can raise the melting point substantially. Based on similar structures, the imidazolyl group can be predicted to increase the melting point by about 210 degrees.",
