        "Reason": "The parent compound, decane, has a melting point of approximately -30\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group can increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, methyl groups can also introduce steric hindrance and reduce the symmetry of the molecule, which often results in a lower melting point due to a less orderly packing of the molecules in the solid state. Considering the impact of the methyl group in 3-methyldecane compared to decane, the effect of symmetry reduction and steric hindrance might outweigh the increase due to molecular weight, thus leading to a prediction of a melting point slightly lower than that of decane.",

        "Reason": "The parent compound, decane, has a melting point of approximately -30\u00b0C. A single methyl group typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and slight increases in van der Waals forces, generally in the order of +5\u00b0C. However, the introduction of a methyl group can also lower the melting point when considering the structural effect it has on the molecule. The 3-methyl group in 3-methyldecane disrupts the straight-chain structure of decane, creating a branching point, which reduces molecular symmetry and hinders tight packing in the solid phase. This disruption may have a greater effect on lowering the melting point than the increase in molecular weight. Since the actual value is -76\u00b0C, it suggests that the lowering effect due to branching outweighs the raising effect due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
