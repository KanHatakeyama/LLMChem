        "Reason": "For (1-bromoethyl)benzene, we should consider the effects of both the benzene ring and the bromoethyl substituent on the melting point. The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The addition of an ethyl group tends to slightly decrease the melting point due to increased molecular size, leading to a looser packing in the solid state. This effect might be around -5 \u00b0C. However, the presence of the bromine atom, being a large, heavy atom with significant polarizability, tends to increase intermolecular forces (such as dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals forces), resulting in an increase in the melting point. The bromine effect might be around +40 \u00b0C. Overall, the larger effect is expected to come from the bromine, leading to an increase in the melting point.",

        "Reason": "For (1-bromoethyl)benzene, the molecular structure and functional groups determine the melting point changes. Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, the ethyl group usually lowers the melting point as it increases the molecular size and creates a less compact molecular packing, potentially lowering the melting point by -5 \u00b0C. In contrast, the bromine atom significantly influences the melting point due to its high atomic mass and polarizability, which enhance intermolecular attractions such as London dispersion forces and dipole-dipole interactions. This effect typically raises the melting point. Given the heavy nature of bromine, the increment could be substantial, but since the actual value reflects an overall decrease, the presence of the ethyl group along with the particular molecular geometry and possible crystal packing inefficiencies likely have a stronger effect than initially expected, and thus the decrease due to the ethyl group should be adjusted to better match the observed actual value. This adjustment might result in an additional decrease of around -10 \u00b0C, providing a more significant effect than that of bromine.",

        "Reason": "The compound (1-bromoethyl)benzene can be thought of as benzene with two functional groups attached: an ethyl group and a bromine. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of an ethyl group typically lowers the melting point because it increases the molecular weight and size which tends to disrupt the crystalline lattice, making it easier to melt the compound. The expected change due to ethyl group might be around -5\u00b0C. The presence of a bromine atom significantly influences the melting point due to its large size and high atomic weight, and more importantly, its polarizability, which enhances intermolecular interactions, thus raising the melting point. Bromine could contribute an increase of approximately +10\u00b0C. However, when considering both substituents and their opposing effects on the melting point, the net effect is likely to be a drop, as the alkyl chain's effect on the crystalline structure generally dominates over that of a single halogen atom in alkyl halides.",
