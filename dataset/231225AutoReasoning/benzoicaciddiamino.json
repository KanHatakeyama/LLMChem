        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a typical melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The various substituents will alter this melting point. First, the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) significantly increases the melting point due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and to dimerize, which can be estimated to add around +100\u00b0C. Each amino group (-NH2) can further increase the melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding capabilities, but since they are both on the same benzene ring they might interact with each other, so the incremental increase per amino group may not be as large as when they are isolated. Estimating an addition of around +20\u00b0C per amino group results in a total predicted increase of +40\u00b0C. Therefore, the predicted melting point would be the sum of contributions from the carboxylic acid group and both amino groups.",
