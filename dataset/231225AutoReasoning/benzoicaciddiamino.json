        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the carboxylic acid group significantly increases melting point due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding it can participate in, typically this can add over 100\u00b0C to the melting point. Each amino group can also increase the melting point due to the ability to engage in additional hydrogen bonding. However, the presence of two amino groups on the same benzene ring can result in intramolecular hydrogen bonding which may not increase the melting point as much as intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Estimated additional melting point due to each amino group is about 40-50\u00b0C for intermolecular interactions. Assuming some intramolecular bonding may lessen this effect, the increase might be around 30\u00b0C per amino group, while still considering the enhanced effect of the carboxylic acid group.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the carboxylic acid group significantly increases the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can add more than 100\u00b0C to the melting point. Each amino group is capable of engaging in hydrogen bonding, which typically could raise the melting point by 40-50\u00b0C. However, since there are two amino groups, and they may participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the effect on the melting point might not be as drastic as intermolecular bonding. It's reasonable to estimate an increase of about 30\u00b0C per amino group in this context. Therefore, combining these effects while factoring in the dominant increase from the carboxylic acid group, leads to the following prediction.",

        "Reason": "The base compound benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Adding carboxylic acid functionality typically raises the melting point significantly due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the formation of a dimeric structure, which could contribute an increase of up to 150\u00b0C. Each amino group can also raise the melting point due to extra hydrogen bonding capability; an amino group might contribute an increase of about 50\u00b0C per group. However, the combined ortho- and para-substitution in the benzene ring might mediate the effects somewhat by steric hindrance and electronic effects, possibly reducing the increase brought by each amino group by 10\u00b0C, totaling 40\u00b0C for both amino groups. Together, these functional group effects can be summed to estimate the melting point of the target compound.",
