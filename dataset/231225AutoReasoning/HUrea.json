        "Reason": "The base unit to consider for (~2~H_4_)Urea or deuterated urea is urea itself which has a melting point of 133\u00b0C. Isotopic substitution often leads to a phenomenon known as the 'kinetic isotope effect', which generally results in stronger bonds and slightly higher melting points due to the larger atomic mass of deuterium compared to hydrogen. The deuterium substitution in urea might be expected to raise the melting point by a small factor, let's estimate this as +1\u00b0C per deuteration. Therefore, we might predict an increase of 4\u00b0C for the four deuterium atoms replacing hydrogen atoms.",
