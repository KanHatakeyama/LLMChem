        "Reason": "Thalidomide contains several functional groups that influence its melting point. The base structure of thalidomide is a phthalimide moiety connected to a glutarimide. Phthalimide has a melting point around 238\u00b0C due to its rigid planar structure and capability for hydrogen bonding through the two carbonyl groups. The glutarimide moiety introduces additional ring strain and hydrogen bonding potential through its cyclic amide structure, typically increasing the melting point by about 50\u00b0C. However, thalidomide also has an asymmetric carbon which could slightly lower the melting point due to weaker crystal packing. Estimating a decrease of 10\u00b0C for this factor, the overall prediction would be an increase of 40\u00b0C from the phthalimide baseline.",
