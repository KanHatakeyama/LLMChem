        "Reason": "The compound 2,4-hexadien-1-ol can be analyzed for its melting point by looking at the various functional groups and structural features that characterize it. The base structure is a hexane, which has a melting point of around -95\u00b0C. However, alterations to this structure can shift the melting point, as described below: \n- Conjugated double bonds: Hexadiene has two conjugated double bonds that can increase the rigidity of the molecule due to delocalized pi-electron systems, thus potentially leading to a higher melting point. This influence can be estimated as an increase of +40\u00b0C for the two double bonds. \n- Hydroxyl (OH) group: The hydroxyl group introduces the possibility of hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point due to the stronger intermolecular forces. The OH group can be estimated to raise the melting point by +85\u00b0C. \nTherefore, combining the effects of conjugated double bonds and the OH group to the base melting point of hexane results in the following: -95 (base hexane) + 40 (double bonds) + 85 (OH group).",
