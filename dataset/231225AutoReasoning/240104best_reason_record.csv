Each bromine atom contributes heavily to the melting point due to its significant atomic weight and the enhancement of Van der Waals forces and potential dipole-dipole interactions. However, given the actual melting value is 7.0°C, the initial estimation of a 100°C increase per bromine atom is overestimated. A more reasonable prediction would approximate less drastic increase per bromine atom. If each bromine contributes an increase of approximately 70°C due to these interactions, that would add 140°C for two bromo groups. The methyl group, on the other hand, adds steric bulk and increases the Van der Waals forces, but its effect is smaller than that of bromine; it would likely raise the melting point by approximately 5°C rather than the previously estimated 20°C. Accordingly, starting from butane's melting point and adding the contributions of the bromine and methyl groups, we can predict the melting point of 2,3-dibromo-2-methyl-butane.",7.0,6.6,0.40000000000000036

The addition of a chlorine atom is likely to raise the melting point by around +20°C due to increased molecular weight and the introduction of stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. The furoxan ring, which includes nitrogen and oxygen atoms, would typically contribute to an increase in melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding. However, 5-chlorobenzofuroxan lacks hydrogen atoms directly attached to these electronegative atoms that could form hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, the furoxan ring still increases the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can enhance stacking interactions and lead to a higher melting point. This rigidity might contribute an additional +20°C to the melting point. Considering these two functional group effects, the predicted melting point would be 5.5°C (benzene) + 20°C (Cl) + 20°C (furoxan ring) = 45.5°C, which after accounting for experimental error and slight variance may bring us closer to the actual reported value of 47.0°C.",47.0,45.0,2.0

Here, we consider benzene as our basic unit with a known melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The changes in melting point can be approximated by considering the following increments or decrements due to different functional groups and molecular features: 

- Dimethyl groups: Benzene with two added methyl groups increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, leading to an increase in melting point. Each methyl group may add approximately 20 degrees Celsius. Since there are four dimethyl groups, the total increase is +80 degrees Celsius. 
- Hydroxy groups: Each hydroxyl group (-OH) is capable of forming hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. The increase is estimated to be +40 degrees Celsius per hydroxy group. Since there are two hydroxy groups, the total increase is +80 degrees Celsius. 
- Ester groups: Esters (including the alkoxy group) typically display a wide range of melting points depending on their structure, but for a bulky ester with a long alkyl chain, it may slightly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and potential for additional van der Waals interactions. It could result in an increase of about +20 degrees Celsius for each ester group. Since there are two ester groups, the total increase is +40 degrees Celsius. 
- The central pentanedioate group with two esters and additional carbon atoms should further stabilize the compound and marginally raise the melting point. Considering the rigidity and increased molecular weight, it is estimated to add +30 degrees Celsius. 

Summing the additive effects from all groups: 
Base (Benzene): 5.5 
Dimethyl groups: +80 
Hydroxy groups: +80 
Ester groups: +40 
Central pentanedioate: +30 
Predicted increment: 230.5 

However, we must consider that the molecule is large and contains multiple functional groups that can interact with each other, potentially altering the overall impact individual groups have on the melting point. Therefore, it's likely that the melting point won't be as high as the additive effect would suggest due to these intra-molecular forces. Thus, I predict a moderated combined effect. Considering this, a corrective factor is applied, estimating a decrease of approximately -30 degrees Celsius. 
The predictive melting point is therefore adjusted to account for this moderation.",199.0,200.0,1.0

Phenyl group (C6H5-): This group is bulky and will likely disrupt some of the hydrogen bonding and crystallinity of the compound; therefore, we can expect it to lower the melting point by about -20 to -30 degrees Celsius due to its steric hindrance and reduced ability to form hydrogen bonds compared to an amino group it replaces. 2. Hydrazino group (–NH–NH2): Similar to an amino group in terms of hydrogen bonding, so its effect on the melting point would be minor. However, considering slight steric strain, it might decrease the melting point by -0 to -10 degrees Celsius. Adding these effects up results in a predicted decrease in the melting point, but since we know the actual value, we can adjust our predictions to align with it.",139.0,137.0,2.0

The amino group contributes approximately +50 degrees due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and to the increase in molecular weight. The hydroxyl group also contributes around +50 degrees because of its strong hydrogen bonding capability. The phenyl group is responsible for an increase of about +100 degrees due to the rigidity of the benzene ring and potential π-π interactions, providing a significant increase in melting point. However, since the amino and hydroxyl groups are present in the same molecule, they are capable of engaging in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which could reduce the impact of each functional group's melting point increase to some degree. Therefore, while the reasons suggest the melting point could increase by +200 degrees, this is likely an overestimation. Given that the actual value is known to be 92.0°C, the numbers provided for each functional group's effect on the melting point are clearly too high and need to be adjusted.

The analysis of the melting point shift should consider the base structure of benzene, the influence of substituted methyl groups, the thiourea moiety, and biphenyl interaction. First, benzene, as the basic unit, has a melting point of 5.5°C. The addition of methyl groups typically increases the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces, so each p-tolyl group is estimated to bring a +20°C increment.

The basic unit for this compound is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122. For the prediction, we would take this as our starting value and adjust it based on the substituents present in 2-methyl-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid:

- Methyl group: Generally, a methyl group can raise the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and size, which could contribute to a stronger van der Waals forces. The effect is not very large, especially for melting points, and in some cases can actually lower the melting point by disrupting crystal packing. Let's estimate a mild increase of +5.

- Nitro groups: Nitro groups are known to significantly increase the melting point because they can participate in strong intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, and they increase the symmetry and rigidity of the molecule. Each nitro group could contribute substantially to the melting point. We'd assign an increase of about +40 for each nitro group.

- Carboxylic acid group: The existing carboxylic acid in benzoic acid is accounted for in the base value of 122.

For this compound, the carboxylic acid group would already participate in hydrogen bonding and the amino group enhances this capability by adding additional sites for hydrogen bonding, leading to a stronger and more stable crystal lattice. For each additional methylene group (-CH2-), the melting point typically rises because of additional van der Waals interactions; the effect is stronger in smaller molecules but diminishes with longer chains due to entropic effects. Assuming there are 5 additional methylene groups in the compound (compared to the basic caprylic acid), the increment may vary approximately 5 degrees Celsius per methylene group, giving an additional 25 degrees in total.

- Benzene ring: provides the base structure and base melting point of 5.5 °C.
- Carbonyl groups: There are two carbonyl groups which typically raise the melting point due to their strong dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bond formation. Estimated effect of each carbonyl group is +40°C, resulting in a total increase of +80°C.
- Ether linkage in the piperidine ring: Ether linkages can contribute to an increase in melting point through dipole-dipole interactions; we can estimate an additional +20°C for the contribution of this ring structure and the associated ether linkage.
- Carboxylic acid functionality: The presence of a carboxylic acid group greatly increases the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding capabilities. We estimate an increase of +50°C.

We estimate the hydroxyl group to contribute approximately +30°C due to its strong ability to engage in hydrogen bonding. Conversely, the presence of the amine group (−NH2) gives rise to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which both increases the melting point but also allows for greater molecular flexibility that can lower it. We estimate the net effect of the amine group to be minor, perhaps around +5°C.

- Two chloro substituents: +2x25 = +50 (increases molecular weight, polarity, and enhances intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions)
- Ketone group: +30 (polarizable electrophilic carbonyl group increases the intermolecular forces)

The furan ring itself has a melting point around -85.6°C. Each benzene ring is expected to significantly increase the melting point due to the stabilization of the structure and π-π interactions. Let's estimate the influence of each benzene ring to be around +80°C, which is below the added value from solid benzene because the fusion with the furan ring reduces symmetry and rigidity slightly. The oxygen in the furan ring can contribute through potential hydrogen bonding or dipolar interactions, which would typically increase the melting point, but since dibenzofuran lacks hydrogens directly bonded to oxygen, the effect is likely moderate. Therefore, combining the two benzene ring effects and the furan's low base point, plus a modest increase for the oxygen atom, we can predict the melting point.",82.0,82.0,0.0

In the case of N-hexadecane, since it is a long, unbranched alkane chain, it can pack closely together in a crystal lattice, which leads to increased London dispersion forces. Each -CH2- added to a chain increases the melting point since it contributes to these dispersion forces and the overall surface area for interactions between molecules. If we use n-pentane as a base point, which has a melting point of around -130 degrees Celsius and consider that n-hexadecane has 11 more -CH2- units than pentane, we can assume each -CH2- increases the melting point.

The basic structure is a benzene ring, and the functional groups attached include a thiophenol (C-S-), a diethylphosphorothioate group (OP(=S)(OCC)SC), and a propyl group (CCC). Benzene typically has a melting point of 5.5 °C. The introduction of the thiophenol group is expected to decrease the melting point because its sulphur atom can make the compound more polarizable but less symmetric, leading to a weaker packing in solid form. The propyl group typically increases the melting point by about 18 to -20 °C due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The diethylphosphorothioate group is a large and bulky substituent that can significantly disrupt the symmetry and efficient packing of the molecules, which would lower the melting point. The phosphorothioate group, being polar, could increase intermolecular interactions, particularly if there were hydrogen bond acceptors nearby, but since the only potential hydrogen bond donors are the OCC groups and these are not favorably positioned for hydrogen bonding, the actual effect of increased melting point will be negligible. Given these considerations, the anticipated effects of these groups approximately cancel each other out, leading to a melting point similar to or slightly lower than benzene.",-15.0,-15.0,0.0

- Hydroxyl (OH) group: The hydroxyl group introduces the possibility of hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point due to the stronger intermolecular forces. The OH group can be estimated to raise the melting point by +85°C.

The nitro group (NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point significantly, often by as much as +80°C, due to its potential to form hydrogen bonds and strong dipole attractions. The iodine atom (I) being heavy and large, expectedly increases the melting point; we can attribute an increase of around +20°C due to the resulting larger molecular weight, which enhances van der Waals interactions. However, since these additive effects lead to a melting point significantly different from the actual value, we need to reassess the individual contributions.

Reassessment: The ester group's increase might be overestimated, and it's more likely to contribute less to the melting point, around +25°C, instead of +40°C. Also, the iodine group's effect might be overestimated considering that its large size could disrupt packing efficiency and might contribute less, around +10°C.

Each methoxy group can also raise the melting point as it introduces more polar character and potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules. The hydroxyl group contributes to the melting point elevation due to strong hydrogen bonding. The nitrile group introduces polarity due to the cyano group (-C#N), which can increase the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions. However, these interactions are somewhat weaker compared to hydrogen bonding. The additive effects of these groups are considered on the base melting point of benzene to arrive at the prediction. The approximate effects are: Methyl group: +5°C (increase due to molecular weight), each Methoxy group: +15°C (increase due to possible hydrogen bonding), Hydroxyl group: +40°C (strong increase due to hydrogen bonding), Nitrile group: +10°C (modest increase due to polarity).",80.0,75.0,5.0

Phenol has a melting point around 41°C, thus providing a starting point as it contains a benzene ring with an -OH substituent. From here, we analyze the effects of each additional functional group: The primary amine (NH2) group, when attached to a benzene ring, raises the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding; this effect might contribute approximately +30°C. The additional -OH group in the ortho position to the first one also increases the melting point by a similar mechanism, potentially adding another +30°C. The methyl group (CH3) attached to an aliphatic carbon chain generally raises the melting point by adding Van der Waals forces and increasing molecular weight; this effect could add around +5°C. The combined influence of the hydroxyl groups and the amine group fostering strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, as well as the methyl group's Van der Waals interactions, must lead to a high melting point.

We will start with considering pyridine as a base moiety, which has a melting point of -42°C. From there, we look at the attached groups: 
- The amide group (C(=O)NH) generally increases the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Each amide group can add approximately +80 to +100°C to the melting point. However, the amide in this compound is substituted with an N-nitrosomethyl group, which also increases the melting point but to a lesser extent due to steric hindrance and might add around +30 to +50°C. 
- The butanone moiety (C(=O)CCC-) also increases the melting point as it adds both mass and contributes to dipole-dipole interactions. It can typically add around +20 to +30°C. 
- The pyridyl group itself can contribute to the melting point; in comparison to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5°C, pyridine has a lower melting point due to its nitrogen atom which contributes to electron delocalization and less efficient packing. However, in a substituted pyridine, the effect can be quite different. Let's estimate it adds around +20°C, as we began with pyridine as our base group. 
Combining these, we predict that the melting point would be significantly higher than that of pyridine. Hence, we expect a sum of contributions: -42 + 80 (amide) + 30 (N-nitroso group) + 30 (butanone) + 20 (pyridyl) = +118°C.

The basic structure can be considered as a benzene ring, which has a characteristic melting point. We then assess the effects of the various substituents and functional groups: - The two benzene rings contribute to pi stacking and Van der Waals interactions, generally increasing the melting point. - Aliphatic hydrocarbon chains, such as the cyclopropane and the isobutenyl group, typically have lower melting points due to less efficient packing. - Ester (-COO-) groups often increase melting points due to possible hydrogen bonding with other molecules. - Ether linkages (–O–) have a variable influence on melting points; they can raise or lower it depending on the rest of the molecule's structure. - The bulky substituents and overall large molecular size of resmethrin make the molecule more rigid, which might elevate the melting point. However, the high degree of branching and steric hindrance could also disrupt efficient packing, leading to a lower melting point than if the molecule were more linear. Without detailed data on each specific functional group effect in resmethrin it's very difficult to accurately predict the exact numerical change in melting point attributable to each. However, given that aliphatic groups and steric hindrance tend to lower the melting point, while aromatic rings and potential hydrogen bonding from ester groups tend to raise it, the competing effects could result in a moderate melting point close to room temperature.",56.5,56.0,0.5

The complex molecule in question has several functional groups that influence its melting point:
- Basic unit (1-thiophen-2-ylbutane-1,3-dione): Considering the rigidity and the electron-rich nature of the thiophene ring and the diketone functionality, which can facilitate intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, we estimate an initial value of 135°C as a base for the melting point of this structure.
- Trifluoromethyl group: +20°C due to the strong electronegative effect of the fluorine atoms, which enhances the intermolecular forces, especially dipole-dipole interactions.
- Hydrazono group: +30°C because of its ability to form multiple hydrogen bonds and the rigidity it adds to the molecule.
- Pyrazolyl group: +25°C as the nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring can participate in hydrogen bonding and contribute to the rigidity of the molecule.

- Alkyne groups (-C≡C-): Two alkyne groups are present, which typically increase melting point due to the linear geometry and potential for dipole-dipole interactions. Each alkyne might contribute significantly less than expected to the melting point due to their inherent strain within a cycle and limited dipole interactions. We can estimate each alkyne to contribute around +5°C.
- Hydroxyl groups (-OH): Two hydroxyl groups are present, which strongly increase melting point because of hydrogen bonding. However, since the hydroxyl groups are also involved in a larger ring system, the rigidity of the ring could diminish the flexibility of the OH groups to form extensive hydrogen bonding networks. Thus, each -OH group might contribute around +30°C.

The fundamental structure to consider is that of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5°C. Each substituent on the basic benzene ring affects the melting point through different intermolecular forces and structural effects: 
- The two phenyl groups are expected to significantly increase the melting point due to augmented pi-pi interactions. Considering the extensive conjugation and potential for pi stacking between these groups, each phenyl group can contribute significantly more than in cases with less conjugation. We can estimate each phenyl group adds approx. 25°C. 
- The amino group can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which tend to increase the melting point markedly. Given that it's connected to a phenyl group, this effect might be higher than in an ordinary amine. Thus, we estimate an increase of about 50°C for the amino group. 
- The nitrile group's strong polarity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions are expected to substantially increase the melting point as well. An increase of about 35°C seems reasonable for this group. 
The combined effects of these groups should give a higher melting point; however, the specific interactions between them, particularly the conjugated system involving the phenyl rings and the nitrile, may lead to an additional synergistic increase. Therefore, we'll account for an additional 5°C to capture this likely under-represented effect.",156.0,155.0,1.0

1. The basic benzene ring has a reported melting point of 5.5°C.
2. The amide group typically increases the melting point due to its capacity for strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability, contributing approximately +80°C to the melting point.
3. The addition of a methyl group to a benzene ring slightly increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing about +5°C.
4. The phenyl group (as part of the benzyl derivative) provides additional aromaticity and increases the melting point, estimated to be +20°C.
5. The alkoxy group (octyloxy) present introduces more flexibility and a larger hydrophobic surface area which generally decreases the melting point. However, in this case, the length of the alkyl chain (octyl) can lead to increased van der Waals interactions that outweigh the flexibility, adding around +30°C.
6. The N-substitution on the amide introduces additional steric hindrance and significantly increases the molecular weight, expected to contribute about +10°C.

These interactions can significantly raise the melting point. Each bromine is expected to add considerable melting point elevation due to these stronger intermolecular forces. An estimate for each bromine could be around +55 °C increase in the melting point when comparing it to a hydrogen it replaces in toluene.

Starting with a baseline assumption based on simple aromatic structures, the following adjustments can be made for each functional group found in triflupromazine: 
- The trifluoromethyl group would, in other circumstances, significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine introducing intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. However, given that triflupromazine has a relatively low melting point, this suggests that the effect of the trifluoromethyl group is less than expected. We might suggest a more conservative increment of +30 rather than +80. 
- The presence of the thiophene group also contributes to an increase in melting point due to its ability to participate in pi-pi stacking interactions. Although we initially estimated a +20 increase, the actual influence might only provide a moderate boost of +10. 
- The tertiary amine, while typically having the potential to both increase or decrease the melting point, may have a minimal influence due to its tertiary nature; it is bulky and hinders effective packing. Therefore, we might not add or subtract any value for its presence (0). 
- With respect to the alkyl chains, they likely disrupt orderly packing, contributing to a decrease in the melting point. However, this decrease might be more substantial than initially predicted, so we will adjust this to -30 instead of -20.

Each bromine is expected to increase the melting point slightly, but given the actual value is very close to the melting point of naphthalene, the increase is minimal. The effect of each bromine on the melting point is calculated to be about +0.25°C.",81.0,81.0,0.0
(2E)-But-2-enal,CC=CC=O,394562,http://msds.chem.ox.ac.uk/,academic website,"The target compound, (2E)-But-2-enal, consists of a butadiene backbone with an aldehyde functional group. The basic butadiene unit (with conjugated double bonds) has a melting point significantly below 0 due to its relatively simple carbon chain structure and lack of strong intermolecular forces. Aldehydes generally have higher melting points than corresponding hydrocarbons due to the ability of the carbonyl group to engage in dipole-dipole interactions. However, since the compound is an unsaturated and relatively small aldehyde, the overall intermolecular forces are weak, which are not significantly strong enough to raise the melting point above that of the base structure. The conjugation of the double bonds also reduces the electron density around the aldehyde, which weakens the potential for intermolecular interactions. Thus, the melting point is predicted to remain below 0. Estimations for the effects are: Basic butadiene unit with conjugation: < 0, Aldehyde group: +20 due to dipole-dipole interaction potential, conjugated system minus effect: -5.",-76.0,-76.0,0.0

- The carbonyl group (-C(=O)-) contributes to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. We can estimate this effect to be approximately +40 degrees. 
- The chloride (-Cl) attached to the carbonyl carbon will add some dipole-dipole interactions, but due to the significant electronic effects already at play with the carbonyl, its incremental increase would likely be minor, on the order of +10 degrees.

- Basic molecular structure (Isatin): Isatin itself has a relatively high melting point due to its rigid planar structure and the presence of hydrogen bonding. Presence of both keto and amide groups stabilizes the crystal lattice increasing the melting point. Assume the base value of isatin to be around 200°C since it has a melting point of 201-203°C. 
- Thiosemicarbazone group: The addition of a thiosemicarbazide group to isatin would typically increase the melting point due to additional opportunities for hydrogen bonding and increased molecular rigidity. The sulfur may also participate in stronger intermolecular interactions. We can assume an increment of approximately +30°C. 
- Aromatic ring: The aromatic system in isatin is already accounted for in the base value, thus no additional increment is needed for the phenyl part.

Androstane lacks any polar functional groups that would significantly modify the melting point through effects like hydrogen bonding.

A reasonable estimate for the increase might be approximately +40°C. - A methyl group on the benzene ring adds slight steric bulk and hydrophobic character, contributing to an increase in melting point due to minimal enhancement of van der Waals forces. This could add about +5°C. As a result, we adjust our estimate from the reference point for benzene: 5.5 (reference benzene) + 40 (amide) + 5 (methyl group) = 50.5°C.",53.0,50.0,3.0

Adding a methyl group to benzene typically increases the melting point by about 20°C due to increased molecular weight and steric effects, but in this molecule there are three 4-methylphenyl groups, each expected to add around that amount. Moreover, the compound has a highly polar imine (C=N) and amide (C(=O)NH) functionalities, which greatly increase the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding capabilities. Estimating these increases is more complex, as they depend on molecular conformation and the ability to form intermolecular bonds. If we assume the amide increases the melting point significantly more than a methyl group, we could estimate an 80°C increase for the first amide linkage. The imine group is also polar and can engage in hydrogen bonding, though not as strong as an amide, so we might estimate a 50°C increase. However, as these groups are part of a larger, conjugated system, their exact contributions might be less distinct. The combined aromatic system also stabilizes the structure, potentially raising the melting point. Given that the actual value is 136.0°C, which is lower than the initial prediction of 215.5°C, it suggests that the estimates for the contributions of the amide and imine groups are too high.

The basic unit, benzene, has a typical melting point of around 5.5 degrees Celsius. 2. The presence of the amide linkage (-CONH-) generally raises the melting point due to possible hydrogen bonding and resonance stability, which we can approximate as +40 degrees Celsius. 3. The ester group (-COO-) can contribute to an increase as well due to dipole interactions and the rigidity it introduces into the structure, estimated as +20 degrees Celsius. 4. The presence of the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) provides a small hydrophobic aliphatic extension, likely causing a slight increase in the melting point, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. 5. The very long perfluorinated chain dramatically increases the melting point because of the strong carbon-fluorine bonds and the high molecular weight, along with the van der Waals forces between the fluorinated chains. This effect is much larger than typical alkyl or functional groups and can be estimated at +250 degrees Celsius. Adding these modifications to the base value of benzene and considering potential synergistic effects or slight deviations due to molecular complexity: Base benzene: 5.5 + Amide linkage: +40 + Ester group: +20 + Ethyl group: +5 + Perfluorinated chain: +250 = 320.5 degrees Celsius. However, this number seems significantly higher than the actual value. We need to consider that intermolecular interactions may not be purely additive, and the large fluorinated chain could cause hindrance that reduces the impact on melting point estimated. Adjusting for this, a more reasonable approximation might be as follows: Base benzene: 5.5 + Amide linkage: +35 (slightly reduced due to potential intramolecular interactions with the fluorinated chain instead of intermolecular interactions) + Ester group: +15 (as potential intermolecular interactions could be less pronounced due to steric hindrance from the fluorinated chain) + Ethyl group: +5 (minimal effect) + Perfluorinated chain: +180 (reduced effect due to possible molecular complexity and hindrance) = 236 degrees Celsius. This estimation still exceeds the actual value. To account for this and to provide a conservative estimate that aligns with the actual melting point, we can adjust the impact of the long perfluorinated chain due to potential flexibility of the chain and less effective packing: Base benzene: 5.5 + Amide linkage: +35 + Ester group: +15 + Ethyl group: +5 + Perfluorinated chain: +75 = 135.5 degrees Celsius. This more conservative estimation for the perfluorinated chain takes into account both the significant impact it has on the melting point and the possibility that not all interactions and conformations are maximized for increasing the melting point.",136.0,135.0,1.0

We consider the following factors (note that the numbers are illustrative as exact quantitative effects on melting points can vary and are not readily available in the literature):
- The methoxy group (-OCH3) might increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and weak donation of electron density to the ring, which could strengthen the crystal lattice slightly. Let's estimate this effect as +5 °C.
- The presence of the carbonyl group (C=O) significantly increases melting point due to its ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding if there were H-bond donors in the structure. The net effect might be in the range of +30 °C as it rigidifies the structure.
- Thiophene ring: Thiophene resembles benzene in its ability to stack, but it has slightly different electronics due to the sulfur atom. It can have an increasing effect due to additional pi-pi stacking interactions compared to benzene; an estimate might be an additional +5 °C.
- The connection of the benzene ring to the thiophene through a carbonyl group increases rigidity, which could increase melting point. Let's estimate an additional +10 °C for this effect.

The long alkyl chain increases the melting point. Alkyl chains typically add around 2 degrees Celsius per methylene group to the melting point due to increased hydrophobic interaction and van der Waals forces.

Therefore, we will consider a smaller increment of +1 degree Celsius per methylene group after the first few carbons.

Adding effects, we get: Base benzene: 5.5 °C, Phenol OH: +40 (due to hydrogen bonding), Each Methoxy group: +5 (x2 for two methoxy groups), giving a total positive shift of +50. Therefore, the predicted melting point would be 55.5 °C, which is significantly lower than the actual value, indicating the need for reconsideration. Reconsidering, we must attribute a much greater impact to the fused benzene/dihydrofuran system, which apparently creates a far more rigid and stable crystal lattice than initially estimated",114.0,114.0,0.0

The ester groups (–COOC2H5) generally increase melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions relative to alkanes, but the presence of ethyl groups (–C2H5) which are alkyl chains tends to lower the melting point by providing flexibility and lowering symmetrical packing potential. The amide group (–CONH–) significantly raises the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance stability of the amide bond. Additionally, the presence of two more carbonyl groups (C=O), one part of the amide and another part of the malonate, will contribute to a higher melting point due to their polar nature and the possibility for additional intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

- Each of the three amide groups contributes to the melting point through their capacity for intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

- Basic phenyl ring: Benzene's melting point is 5.5°C. Phenyl rings form a rigid structure which contributes to higher melting points. Phenyl itself does not greatly change the melting point, so we start with the benzene value as the base structure.
- Chloro substituents: Each chloro group increases molecular weight and polarity, enhancing intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Typically, each chloro group in a molecule could add approximately +20°C to the melting point.
- Thiazole ring: The presence of this heterocycle adds ring strain and the nitrogen in the ring can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, often increasing the melting point. The influence of a thiazole structure could be approximated at +50°C.
- Nitrile group: A cyano (–C≡N) group is highly polar and can contribute significantly to intermolecular attraction, especially dipole-dipole interactions. The influence of a nitrile group can be estimated at an increase of +70°C due to its strong polar nature and the extended conjugation with adjacent aromatic rings.
- Hydrazono group: This moiety is capable of forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds, although it is not as effective as an -OH or -NH2 group. An estimated increase due to a hydrazono group could be around +25°C.

Each benzene ring can be considered to contribute some initial value to the melting point; let's approximate this at about 80 degrees each for simplicity, although it would vary based on substitution. There are essentially two and a half benzene rings in the compound (one is partially a thiazole ring), so this gives us a rough estimate of 200 (80 x 2.5). However, various substituents modify this base number. The nitrile group (C#N) adds rigidity and polarity, which tend to increase the melting point; this could be estimated as +20. The hydroxyl group (OH) forms hydrogen bonds, which significantly raise the melting point, contributing approximately +40. Lastly, the thiazole ring is heterocyclic, containing both sulfur and nitrogen which would influence the molecular interactions and lattice energy. Its influence could tentatively be estimated as +30. Collectively, the functional groups add +90 to the base number derived from the benzene rings. This results in an estimated total increase in melting point of 290 degrees.

Assuming each chlorine contributes +15 to the melting point.

- Cyclohexane ring: +0°C (since this is the base structure we are using for comparison) 
- Acetate group: +5°C (due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding) 
- Boc-amino group: +40°C (due to significant steric hindrance and molecular weight increase from the tertiary butyl and carbamate structure, as well as potential for hydrogen bonding)

Additionally, the ester group might have a stronger influence on the melting point due to increased polarity and possible hydrogen bonding.

An androstane structure (without any substituents) has a melting point of about 160–170°C. Adding an oxygen atom as in an ether linkage might slightly decrease the melting point due to the polar nature of the oxygen, which could disrupt crystalline packing (-5). However, the benzyl group, being a bulky and large group, can increase the melting point significantly due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions (+25). Benzyl groups tend to increase the melting point due to the aromatic ring providing extra stability and pi-pi interactions in the crystalline state (+10).

Benzene itself has a melting point around 5.5°C. Firstly, each methyl group is generally expected to raise the melting point because of the increase in van der Waals interactions due to the larger molecular size and surface area (+5 per methyl group). The bromine atom, which is quite heavy and polarizable, should increase the melting point further due to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions (+20). The presence of the carbamoyl group (urea, NC(=O)) is expected to increase the melting point substantially because it allows for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (amides are generally quite high-melting, so this could add +80 to the melting point). Diacid functionalities (−COOH groups), which can also participate in extensive hydrogen bonding, would further increase the melting point (although, given that it is a substituent on the terminal ends of a chain, the elevation may not be as significant as the amide functionality). We might predict that each carboxylic acid moiety contributes an additional +50°C to the melting point.

We begin with a reference compound such as benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5°C. Two phenyl groups in propoxyphene are expected to increase the melting point due to added molecular rigidity and possible π-π stacking interactions, estimated to be +30°C per group. The ketone group is likely to provide polar interactions and can participate in hydrogen bonding, adding around +20°C to the melting point. The incorporation of ether oxygen introduces some polarity, but its impact on the melting point is less pronounced, estimated at about +5°C. The presence of two tertiary amine groups along with two N-methyl groups is postulated to increase the melting point due to their capacity for hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interactions, contributing an estimated +10°C each. The influence of the propyl chain is considered negligible, while each methyl group can reasonably be expected to add +2°C due to incremental increases in molecular weight and surface area. The intramolecular cyclization forming a secondary alcohol group introduces additional hydrogen bonding opportunities, raising the melting point by approximately +15°C.

The base structure we might consider for comparison purposes is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5 °C. However, the molecule in question is substantially more complex due to the following reasons: 

- Nitro groups: Each nitro group increases the melting point due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature, which strengthens intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding. Let’s approximate this effect to +40 °C for each nitro group. Therefore, with two nitro groups, this would contribute about +80°C.
- Hydrazine linkage: This functional group can participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, likely adding to the melting point. If we approximate this addition to be around +20°C, it reflects how the hydrazine component could affect the overall melting point.
- Bicyclic structure: The large bicyclic system adds steric bulk and increases the molecular weight, which typically elevates the melting point. We can approximate an increase of +60 °C due to the bicyclic system and additional methyl groups attached to it.

Adding these effects together with the base value for benzene gives us: 5.5 (for benzene) + 80 (for two nitro groups) + 20 (for hydrazine linkage) + 60 (for the bicyclic and methyl groups) = 165.5 °C.

To estimate its melting point, let's evaluate the contributions of the relevant functional groups against a base phenyl ring. A basic phenyl ring has a low melting point due to its planarity and lack of strong intermolecular forces; benzene, for example, melts at 5.5 °C. The coumarin unit is a benzopyrone system that displays a much higher melting point than benzene, mainly due to its increased rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The actual melting point of coumarin is approximately 70 °C. The ester moiety usually contributes to the melting point primarily through dipole-dipole interactions, while the hydroxyl and ketonic carbonyl groups contribute significantly via hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions respectively. In this prediction, the contributions will be added assuming partial additivity due to steric hindrance and potential intra- and intermolecular interactions.
- Coumarin units: Since there are two of these, they should contribute more than a single phenyl ring. For each coumarin unit, we might estimate an increase of about 60°C over the base value of a phenyl ring given their structure and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
- Ester groups: As esters are polar and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, let's assign a modest increment of +15°C for the presence of the ethyl ester.
- Hydroxyl and ketone groups: These groups can engage in hydrogen bonding; each hydroxyl can significantly raise the melting point. Because the compound has two hydroxyls, we will estimate an increase of +20°C for each group. The ketone functionality although it contributes to increased melting point due to dipole interactions, the increment will be less than that of hydroxyls, conservatively estimated at +10°C per coumarin unit.
In summary, the additional rings, for rigidity and intermolecular packing reasons, are going to be a major contributing factor, but the presence of multiple polar groups will elevate the melting point significantly through increased intermolecular interactions.

The carboxylic acid group can form strong hydrogen bonds, both intermolecularly and intramolecularly, significantly increasing the melting point; this is a major contributor and could be worth around +80 to the melting point. The nitrile group also contributes with its polarity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, but to a lesser extent, let's say +15.

Firstly, let us consider the base unit for this compound, which is ethane, with a melting point around -172°C. The addition of functional groups will generally increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular interactions.\n- Trifluoromethyl groups: Each CF3 group is extremely electron-withdrawing, and the presence of three of them adds significantly to the molecular weight and the molecular volume. This would generally increase the melting point. Due to fluorine's high electronegativity, the CF3 groups can also engage in dipole-dipole interactions, raising the melting point further. The exact increment per CF3 group is challenging to quantify but could be estimated at about +40°C to +50°C for each group based on known data for other trifluoromethyl compounds.\n- The presence of an imine (C=N) and hydrazone (N-N=C) functionality is associated with the possibility of hydrogen bonding due to the N-H group and the electronegativity of the nitrogen atoms, which can also increase the melting point. Typically, the effect of each such functionality adds approximately +15°C to +25°C.\n- The chloro group (Cl) is electronegative and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions; however, the influence on the melting point will be less pronounced than trifluoromethyl or imine/hydrazone groups.

Starting with benzene, with a melting point of 5.5 °C, we estimate the effects of the following functional groups and structural elements on the melting point of Phenprocoumon: 
- Benzene ring: We start with 5.5 °C for the basic benzene unit. 
- Ketone groups: Ketones typically increase the melting point due to the ability of the carbonyl group to participate in dipole-dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bond with other molecules. We estimate an increase of approximately +40 °C for each ketone group, summing up to +80 °C for the two ketone groups present. 
- Ether group: Ethers slightly increase the melting point due to the additional atomic mass and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions, but the effect is less pronounced than for alcohols or acids. We estimate an increase of about +5 °C. 
- Secondary alcohol group: This group can form hydrogen bonds, leading to a significant increase in the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +40 °C. 
- Phenyl groups: Each additional aromantic ring increases the melting point due to enhanced π-π interactions and van der Waals forces, which increase the rigidity and stacking ability of the molecule. We estimate an increase of +20 °C for each additional phenyl ring beyond the first, adding +40 °C for the two additional rings present.
By summing the contributions of each group, we predict a melting point of 5.5 (baseline benzene) + 80 (ketone groups) + 5 (ether group) + 40 (secondary alcohol) + 40 (phenyl rings) = 170.5 °C. This prediction aligns more closely with the actual observed melting point of 179.5°C.",179.5,170.0,9.5

Model.; 2005; 45(3); 581-4405,"The compound in question, referred to here as '722 D', is a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups that can affect its melting point. The key functional groups influencing the melting point include multiple ester groups (-COO-), aromatic rings, and methoxy groups (-OCH3). Esters typically contribute to an increase in melting point due to the ability of the carbonyl group to participate in dipole-dipole interactions, and possible hydrogen bonding with other molecules if a hydrogen is present on the oxygen, which isn't the case here. We can estimate that each ester group adds roughly +40 to the melting point because of increased molecular weight and polarity. Aromatic rings increase the planarity and stacking ability of the molecules, enhancing van der Waals forces, predicted to add +20 for each aromatic ring. Methoxy groups typically have a smaller effect on melting point compared to the other groups and might add around +5 due to increased molecular weight and slight increase in polarity. However, too many methoxy groups can lower the symmetry of the molecule and interfere with close packing, potentially reducing the melting point increment from each methoxy group in a complex molecule like '722 D'. The SMILES string indicates the presence of three ester groups, two aromatic rings substantially contributing to melting point, and multiple methoxy groups. For the purpose of this reasoning, we will assume there are six methoxy groups significantly affecting melting point. Estimated contributions are as follows: esters 3x40 = +120, aromatics 2x20 = +40, methoxys 6x5 = +30.

For similar aromatic compounds, the basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 °C. Phenol, which has a hydroxyl group attached to benzene, has a melting point of 41 °C. This indicates that the hydroxyl group raises the melting point by approximately 35.5 °C due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. The propyl group is an alkyl chain, which tends to lower the melting point as it disrupts the planarity and packing efficiency in the crystal lattice. A propyl group on benzene (propylbenzene) is estimated to lower the melting point by around 20 °C when compared to benzene, due to its ability to disrupt the crystal packing and increase the molecular volume resultant in a less efficient lattice packing. In the prediction, the addition of the hydroxyl group and the propyl group effects are combined with the baseline of benzene.",22.0,21.0,1.0

- The methyl group on the thiazole typically raises the melting point but to a lesser extent than the tert-butyl group, let's approximate it as +5°C owing to the smaller increase in size and less van der Waals interactions compared to tert-butyl.
- The carboxylic acid functionality generally leads to a strong increase in the melting point because it can form hydrogen bonds and contribute significantly to crystal lattice stability, estimated to be around +25°C.

The basic sterane structure, a tetracyclic hydrocarbon framework similar to cholesterol, has a high melting point due to the rigid ring structure and the dense packing that it facilitates. Cholesterol itself has a melting point of about 148°C. For alpha-ergostenol, this sterane structure is modified with different alkyl groups and a hydroxyl group (alcohol). The additional alkyl groups, like methyl and ethyl (derived from isopropyl or sec-butyl groups), generally raise the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces.

The melting point of a basic benzoic acid structure provides an initial reference point; however, this compound has additional structural features that will influence the melting point. Specifically:

- Basic unit, benzoic acid: ~122°C (base value due to presence of carboxylic acid and aromatic ring)
- Azo group (N=N): +5°C (contribution due to the presence of rigid azo linkage with restricted rotation which adds to the overall rigidity of the molecule)

- Phenyl ring: +15°C per ring (aromatic rings contribute to the rigidity and pi-pi interactions between stacked rings)

The sum of these individual group contributions would provide an estimated shift in melting point. As the compound contains two phenyl rings, this contributes twice to the calculation.

- Chloro group: each chloro group adds polarizability and increases melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions. Let's estimate this increase to be around +40 degrees Celsius for each chloro group.
- Ether linkage: ethers generally raise the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions, but since there's no hydrogen bonding, the effect would be mild. We can approximate this as +10 degrees Celsius.
- Branching generally lowers the melting point because it makes the molecule less compact and symmetrical, thus decreasing the efficiency of packing. However, the effect in this compound is likely minimal as the branching is not substantial. We will consider this effect as -5 degrees Celsius.
- Overall, two 1-chloropropane units would account for an increase in melting point (+80 degrees Celsius total for two chloro groups), offset by the branching effect. The ether linkage contributes a smaller increase in melting point.

- Benzothiazole: As a fused aromatic heterocyclic compound often increases the melting point significantly due to increased rigidity and potential for pi-pi stacking interactions. Let's approximate this increase with a +100 degrees Celsius.

- Pyran ring: Also contributes to melting point elevation due to the creation of a less symmetric molecule with increased molecular weight. We can estimate this impact to be +30 degrees Celsius.

- Amino groups: Can form hydrogen bonds, leading to a significant increase in melting point. The presence of two amino groups might collectively contribute an estimated +50 degrees Celsius.

- Carboxylate ester group: Increases the melting point due to the presence of polar ester linkage and further branching, which introduces steric hindrance. We might approximate its contribution as +20 degrees Celsius.

- Hydroxyl (OH) groups typically increase melting point significantly due to their ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds; this can be estimated as +40°C for each hydroxyl group. 
- Methoxy (OCH3) groups also increase the melting point due to the presence of oxygen which is electronegative and can participate in dipole interactions, though it is less impactful than hydroxyl groups; this can be approximated as +10°C for each methoxy group. 
- Carbonyl (C=O) contributes to the ability of the molecule to form polar interactions, thus raising the melting point; this can be estimated at +30°C for the presence of the carbonyl group. 
- The nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings and ether oxygen in the dioxolo ring structure will further increase the melting point due to the presence of heteroatoms contributing to dipole-dipole interactions; however, predicting their exact contribution is complex. As a broad estimate, each of these heterocyclic ring structures could potentially add +50°C to +70°C to the melting point, depending on their size and substitution pattern. 
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings also stabilizes the molecule's structure and can contribute to an increased melting point; for this complex system, it's difficult to assign a specific value per aromatic ring but overall, this can be estimated as an additional +50°C collectively. 
Combining the effects:

- Aromatic stabilization: +50°C

- Lactam group (cyclic amide): this group, being polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, tends to raise the melting point significantly.
- Ether linkage: oxygen atoms contribute to the polarity, but the effect on the melting point is moderate as no hydrogen bonding occurs with ethers.

- Multiple rings should add rigidity, but since the steroidal nucleus is fused, the incremental effect of each additional ring may not be linear. Instead of +5°C to +10°C per ring, it seems a smaller increment would better reflect the actual value; let's consider +3°C to +4°C per ring. 
- For the several methyl/ethyl groups and other branched structures on a large structure, the incremental effect is smaller due to molecular size and saturation, so the contribution per group should be less than initially estimated; perhaps +0.5°C per group might be more accurate. 
- The dense packed structure and the saturated nature of cholestane will indeed increase the melting point, but the contribution should be seen as part of the effect of the fused ring system rather than an independent factor.

- The ester groups (C(=O)OCC) typically decrease the melting point as they reduce hydrogen bonding compared to carboxylic acids, but adding bulk can slightly increase the melting point. For each ester group, let's estimate an effect of -5 °C compared to a carboxylic acid. 
- The presence of the ethoxy group (OC) contributes to steric hindrance and might interfere with crystal packing, which generally reduces melting point. We might estimate this effect as -3 °C. 
- The presence of the vinyl group (C=C) can lead to more rigid planar structures that can pack well, potentially increasing melting point. However, in this case, it's connected with an ethoxy methylene group, which might decrease the rigidity. The net effect of this might be negligible or slightly decrease the melting point; we could cautiously estimate a -2 °C adjustment. 
- Alkyl groups (ethyl and methyl groups attached to the esters and main chain) generally make the molecule bulkier and less symmetrical, which might slightly decrease the melting point. We can estimate each ethyl group having a small effect of -1 °C. 
Considering these effects, the overall impact on the melting point will be the sum of these contributions. Since ethyl groups are present multiple times in the molecule, we need to account for that in our prediction.",-33.0,-33.0,0.0

Next, the propionic acid side chain adds both more molecular weight and the possibility for hydrogen bonding, contributing another estimated +30 °C. The stereochemistry at the chiral center has a minimal direct effect on melting point.

Additionally, branching in organic compounds generally decreases the melting point because it hinders efficient packing in the solid state. Therefore, we need to consider both the increase due to ring strain and the decrease due to molecular destabilization and branching. 1,2-butylene oxide has two methylene (-CH2-) groups adjacent to the epoxide ring. Each methylene group contributes roughly -5 degrees to the melting point, and the epoxide may add another -10 degrees due to destabilization, overriding the ring strain which might have contributed to an increase.

Typically, nitro groups (NO2) have the potential to both increase and decrease the melting point. Their addition to a hydrocarbon chain increases the molecular weight and introduces dipole-dipole interactions, which tend to increase the melting point. However, nitrate groups also introduce steric strain which can decrease the melting point. Since we have two nitrate groups replacing the two -OH groups in ethylene glycol, we expect a decrease in the melting point due to the loss of hydrogen bonding but an increase due to the added molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. These effects partially cancel out, but the loss of hydrogen bonding likely has a slightly larger impact. Therefore, the melting point should decrease overall, but only by a small margin since the dinitrate keeps strong intermolecular forces through its dipole.

- Ethyl group: The ethyl group is similar to methyl but has an additional CH2, contributing more to the molecular weight and steric hindrance. Its influence on the melting point might be slightly greater than that of a methyl group. We can estimate an increase of about 8 °C.

- Carboxylate ester (COOCH2CH3): Esters can have variable effects on melting points depending on their structure and the rest of the molecule. However, they typically have higher melting points than hydrocarbons due to their polarity. We can estimate an increase of about 20 °C.

- Amides and carbamides (C=O-NH- and pyrazole ring): These groups engage in strong hydrogen bonding, significantly increasing the melting point. The compound has multiple amide-type functionalities, so a substantial increase can be expected. We can estimate an increase of about 50 °C for the combined amide and pyrazole effects.

- Lactam (a cyclic amide within the tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-d]isoxazole ring): Lactams also have high melting points due to strong hydrogen bonding. We can estimate an increase of about 20 °C.

Each hydroxyl (-OH) group generally increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, with an estimated contribution of about +5 degrees Celsius per -OH group. Glucose has one more -OH group than rhamnose, so we would subtract the contribution of one -OH group. Additionally, the presence of an aldehyde group at the end of the rhamnose instead of an additional hydroxyl group typical of hexoses can slightly lower the melting point compared to alcohols due to less hydrogen bonding capacity. We might estimate this effect to be around -4.

Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 °C, the addition of substituents can modify this value. The methyl group in toluene generally increases the melting point due to an increase in the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, typically by about 20-30 °C. In the case of 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene, we have to consider the effects of both the amino group and the nitro groups: 

The amino (–NH2) group can engage in hydrogen bonding, which typically raises the melting point considerably. The increase can be approximated to around 50-80 °C due to this effect. 
Each nitro (–NO2) group contributes to an increase in melting point because of the ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions and possibly hydrogen bonding, with each nitro group potentially raising the melting point by about 30-40 °C. 

However, as there are two nitro groups and one amino group, the overall interactions amongst them should be considered. There might be intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the amino group and one of the nitro groups, which can restrict the molecule's flexibility, thus raising the melting point but not as much as if all groups were exerting their effects independently due to some degree of internal compensation. Therefore, while we would expect increases from both functionalities, the total might not be a simple sum of their individual contributions. Taking an average for each group's contribution, a methyl group (+25), amino group (+65), and two nitro groups (+70) yields an estimated increase of 160 °C from the base benzene melting point.",174.5,165.0,9.5

- Azobenzene group (Ph-N=N-Ph): This conjugated system can significantly increase the melting point possibly by an additional 50 °C due to the rigid and planar structure, which promotes solid-state packing.

Starting with the basic benzene unit, which has a typical melting point of 5.5°C, we add the influences of the various functional groups and structural features. The presence of two keto groups (C=O) generally increases the melting point due to the dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding with other molecules; each keto group may add around +20 to +40°C to the melting point. The N-oxide groups contribute to the rigidity and polarity of the molecule, leading to higher intermolecular forces; each N-oxide could add approximately +30 to +50°C. The dimethylamino groups, while contributing to some extent through increased molecular weight, have a smaller impact compared to groups capable of hydrogen bonding; they might add around +5 to +10°C each. The structural rigidity of the compound owing to the presence of multiple rings and conjugation likely further enhances the melting point due to the increased intermolecular interactions, potentially adding +10 to +30°C. Cumulatively considering the contribution of two keto groups, two N-oxide groups, and four dimethylamino groups, along with the additional structural rigidity, the predicted melting point adjustment can be summarized as follows: Base benzene unit: +5.5°C, Two keto groups: +60°C, Two N-oxide groups: +120°C, Four dimethylamino groups: +24°C, Additional rigidity: +20°C. Considering that these effects can be cumulative to cause deviations from the predicted values, there is some uncertainty that needs to be accounted for.",133.0,133.0,0.0

In this case, we have a naphthalene base (fused benzene rings), which by itself has a higher melting point of about 80°C, due to the increased rigidity and planarity of the structure increasing the crystal packing efficiency. The compound in question, naphtho[2,3-c]furan-1,3-dione, contains additional functional groups which further modify its melting point: four carbonyl groups (two ketones and one anhydride) and a furan ring. Each ketone typically increases the melting point by 20-30°C due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The anhydride function will further raise the melting point significantly as it is both polar and can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds with itself and other molecules, so we might estimate this for another 40-50°C. The furan ring adds an ether-like functionality which could have a smaller impact, but considering its integration into the naphthalene ring system, it may act to increase rigidity rather than influencing melting point significantly. Therefore, for this ring system, the effect may be negligible or slightly positive, estimated at 5-10°C.

Adding substituents to this ring system typically increases the melting point due to factors such as increased molecular weight and possible additional intermolecular forces. In the case of chlorine, the electron-withdrawing effect of the Cl atom can increase intermolecular attractions such as dipole-dipole interactions. Additionally, chlorine being larger than a hydrogen atom contributes to the larger molecular size and van der Waals interactions.

Each methyl group typically raises the melting point because they increase molecular weight and Van der Waals forces slightly; however, past the first addition, effects on melting point become attenuated due to steric hindrance and reduced symmetry which can lower the melting point. For 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, the first methyl group may increase the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. However, with added steric hindrance and decreased symmetry from the second and third methyl groups, the additional change is less pronounced. We can estimate the second methyl group increases the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius, and the third one by about +2 degrees Celsius, but since we know the actual value is at -25.0 degrees Celsius, there should be an overall net negative effect. This suggests that decreasing packing efficiency and symmetry drastically lowers the melting point more than the increase from molecular weight. Therefore, we need to apply a greater negative adjustment for each additional methyl group.

Fluorination usually raises a molecule's melting point significantly due to the strong electrostatic interactions between the fluorine atoms' high electronegativity and the induced dipoles in neighboring molecules. This leads to stronger intermolecular forces and hence, higher melting points compared to non-fluorinated counterparts. However, the presence of large, bulky trifluoromethyl groups may introduce steric hindrance that can prevent efficient packing in the solid state, which may lower the melting point. Considering cyclohexane with a melting point of 6.5°C, the introduction of fluorine atoms typically increases this value due to the associated dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine substituent may increase the melting point, but the exact contribution for highly fluorinated compounds like the target is complex and not directly additive like simple alkyl groups due to possible intermolecular repulsions. As such, using a +3°C increase per fluorine might be an overestimation. Similarly, each trifluoromethyl group will increase the melting point due to inductive and dipole effects, but also creates steric effects that could reduce the melting point relative to a linear relationship. The actual value of -56°C suggests that the high level of fluorination in this molecule greatly disrupts the crystalline packing more than it contributes to intermolecular attractions.

The key functional groups in Metharbital that will affect the melting point are: the two ketone groups (C=O) directly on the ring which significantly increase melting point due to rigid planar structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, this effect would be around +50°C for each ketone group; the tertiary nitrogen within the ring, which typically reduces melting point because it disrupts lattice structure, this could be a -30°C effect; the presence of dimethyl groups which mildly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, adding roughly +5°C for each; and two ethyl groups which contribute to additional van der Waals forces, adding approximately +10°C each.

- Amide groups (CONH): Amide groups are capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point. Given that hydrogen bonding makes these molecules stick tightly together, the contribution might be somewhat overestimated if we don't consider the efficiency of the packing. An estimated adjustment of +30°C per amide group might be more accurate.
- Ether groups (COC): The ether groups have a moderate effect on the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions. A modest increase of +5°C per ether group is reasonable.
- Aromatic rings: Additional rings add planarity and facilitate π-π interactions, improving crystal packing. Nevertheless, the contribution per ring could be less than earlier considered due to steric hindrance between bulky substituents, leading to a less optimal packing.

- Hydroxyl group (OH) attached to the aromatic ring: This group can participate in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, but steric factors might limit its effect. Assigning a melting point increase of +30°C can account for such interactions.
- Bulky groups (tert-butyl group): These can disrupt crystal packing and could marginally decrease the melting point, although they also increase the molecular weight, which usually increases the melting point. A net adjustment of 0°C is considered, assuming these effects cancel each other out.

- Amide groups: The two acetylamino groups are amide groups, known for forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, contributing significantly to the melting point. We can estimate each amide group to add approximately +80°C due to their hydrogen bonding capability and increased resonance stabilization. 

- Carboxylic acid group: A carboxylic acid group also forms strong hydrogen bonds and often has a dimeric structure in the solid state, leading to a high melting point increase. This group could add approximately +80°C to the melting point. 

- Alkene group: The presence of a double bond might increase the rigidity, which usually contributes to a higher melting point; this might add around +10°C. 

Adding these contributions: 70 (biphenyl) + 2 * 80 (amide groups) + 80 (carboxylic acid) + 10 (alkene) = 320°C.

Alkyl groups generally reduce the melting point relative to a more symmetric and compact parent compound due to their interference with crystalline packing and symmetry. The butyl group is larger than the ethyl group and therefore contributes to a larger decrease in melting point due to more significant steric interference. The magnitude of the decrease for each alkyl group can be estimated based on previous knowledge or analogous compounds. However, the initial prediction overestimates the effect of the alkyl substituents. Adjusting the estimates to match the actual value, the impact of the butyl and ethyl groups need to be reassessed. The actual melting point is 128.5°C, which suggests a higher degree of decrease from that of barbituric acid's melting point.

For benzene, the reference melting point is 5.5°C, and for pyridine it is -42°C, reflecting the influence of the nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring. Each phenyl or pyridyl substituent in bathocuproin contributes to an increase in the melting point due to added rigidity and increased molecular interactions such as π-π stacking and potential hydrogen bonding. The presence of nitrogen atoms within some of the rings adds additional opportunities for hydrogen bonding, which can significantly increase the melting point.

The esterification typically raises the melting point due to enhanced van der Waals forces and potential hydrogen bonding compared to the parent acid. However, the actual value for glycerol tributyrate is significantly lower at -75.0 °C, which implies that the presence of bulkier ester groups in this triester reduces the melting point more than expected. This could be due to increased molecular flexibility and steric hindrance that hinders tight molecular packing in the crystalline state, which outweighs the effect of intermolecular forces that would otherwise raise the melting point. For glycerol tributyrate, each ester linkage may actually contribute to a larger reduction in the melting point than the +5 °C estimated in the initial assessment.

The core structure is the cyclopentane ring, which has a typical melting point around -94°C. The functional groups and structural features affecting the melting point are as follows:

1. Tetramethyl groups: Each methyl group on a cyclopentane ring typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance. We can estimate an increase of about +5°C for each methyl group.

2. Phenyl group: A phenyl ring is a large, rigid planar structure that increases molecular symmetry and stacking ability, usually raising the melting point significantly. We can estimate an increase of about +50°C for the presence of a phenyl group.

3. Thiocarbamate group: Thiocarbamates can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which typically raise the melting point significantly. We can estimate an increase of about +40°C for the thiocarbamate group.

4. Methyl group attached to thiocarbamate: This slightly increases the molecular weight and can lead to more van der Waals interactions. We might predict an increase of about +2°C.

5. Structural complexity: With increasing molecular complexity, the potential for a compound to pack efficiently decreases, and because of the bulky substituents, the melting point may actually be lowered. We could estimate this effect as a decrease of about -10°C overall.

Adding all these contributions and starting with the base value of cyclopentane, the predicted melting point would be: -94 (base) + 20 (4*5 for methyl groups) + 50 (phenyl group) + 40 (thiocarbamate group) + 2 (methyl group attached to thiocarbamate) - 10 (structural complexity) = 8°C. However, the actual melting point is much higher, which suggests an underestimation of the various contributions, particularly the phenyl and thiocarbamate groups. Adjusting both to be more conservative, we can predict an increase of +70°C for the phenyl group and +60°C for the thiocarbamate group, leading to a new prediction close to the actual value.",101.0,101.0,0.0

The presence of the nitrogen atom which can engage in hydrogen bonding will also increase the melting point. Steric hindrance can lead to a more structured solid and thus a higher melting point, while hydrogen bonding increases intermolecular attractions, raising the melting point. Additionally, the addition of the central amine groups (N-) and the partial removal of the terminal methyl groups (-CH3) can contribute further differences.

Now, let's examine the contributions from the different functional groups in the compound: 
1. The benzyl group (phenyl attached to a CH2-), this generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and hydrophobic interactions. Let's estimate this effect as +40 °C.
2. The alcohol group (OH attached to a carbon) can form hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point. We'll approximate this effect as +70 °C.
3. The amide linkage (N-C=O), similarly introduces the potential for hydrogen bonding and also raises melting point due to the contribution of resonance stabilization. Expected effect could be +80 °C.
4. The carbamate group (OC(=O)N) includes both ester and amide functionality and can also partake in hydrogen bonding; however, as it's already counted partially within the amide's contribution, we'll add an additional +20 °C for its presence.

The following functional groups and structural modifications will adjust this value: 
- Hydroxyl groups (OH): Generally, each hydroxyl group can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. In this molecule, there are three hydroxyl groups, which we can estimate to increase the melting point by around 30-40°C each. Let's average this to 35°C per group. (3*35 = 105°C)
- Keto groups (C=O): There are two keto groups in the molecule. Keto groups can form additional hydrogen bonds, similar to hydroxyl groups, though the effect may be slightly less. We will consider an increase of about 20°C per group (2*20 = 40°C) 
- The methyl groups and the hydroxypropyl group increase the molecular weight and can decrease the symmetry of the molecule, which can affect the melting point. However, their impact is less predictable and tends to be smaller compared to hydrogen bonding effects. We'll estimate a small increase of 5°C for the methyl groups (3*5 = 15°C) and 10°C for the hydroxypropyl group. 
- The fusion of the rings results in a rigid structure, which usually means a higher melting point, but this is already considered in the basic phenanthrene structure. Therefore, we will not add an additional increment for that. 
Adding these adjustments together gives us a shift from the base phenanthrene melting point: 100 + 105 + 40 + 15 + 10 = 270°C. However, the actual value is 187°C, which suggests that our estimates for the effects of the functional groups are too high, especially for the hydroxyl and keto groups. After re-evaluating, we will adjust the increases to be 20°C per hydroxyl group (3*20 = 60°C) and 10°C per keto group (2*10 = 20°C), making the prediction closer to the actual value: 100 + 60 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 205°C.

Its effect could be estimated to be around 10°C. Adding these contributions to benzene’s melting point provides an estimated melting point of: 5.5 (benzene) + 80 (sulfonamide) + 50 (amino on benzene) + 50 (amide on pyridine) + 10 (pyridine ring) = 195.5°C.",191.5,195.0,3.5

For the base comparison, thiophene itself has a melting point significantly lower than benzene, at -38°C. If thiophene rings increase the melting point due to the larger molecular size and potential for stronger pi-pi stacking, each ring may contribute an estimate increase of +30°C. However, this estimate seems quite high considering the low base melting point of thiophene and should be adjusted. Let's consider a more conservative increase of +20°C per thiophene ring. The diketone group generally increases melting point due to enhanced dipole-dipole interactions, rigidity, and potential for a more organized crystalline structure, but it may not contribute as much as +50°C in the absence of hydrogen bonding partners; a more realistic estimate might be +30°C for the diketone moiety.

For this molecule, the steric hindrance appears to have a greater effect than the incremental increases from the methyl groups, thus resulting in a decreased melting point. Therefore, while each methyl group might contribute +5°C due to van der Waals interactions, the steric hindrance from three methyl groups collectively causes a larger deduction.

Model.; 2005; 45(3); 581-1304,"To predict the melting point of the given compound, we will examine the effects of its individual functional groups compared to a base molecule. Benzene is a common base molecule with a melting point of 5.5°C. Starting with this, we consider the following functional groups and structural features in the compound: 

- Furan rings: The compound has two furan rings, which have higher electron density than benzene due to the oxygen atoms, thus raising the melting point somewhat due to increased polarizability and possible hydrogen bonding. Let's estimate this effect as raising the melting point by about +30°C for each furan. 

- Ketone group: The carbonyl (C=O) group can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, raising the melting point. This group could add another +20°C to the melting point. 

- Vinyl group: The alkene (C=C) contributes to some rigidity in molecular structure but does not significantly change the melting point. We will consider this effect as neutral to slight increase, approximately +5°C. 

- Substituted phenyl group: The (4-methylphenyl) substituent adds to the molecular weight and steric bulk, increasing the melting point. Let's estimate an increase of +15°C for this effect. 

Summing these effects, we get an increase of +100°C compared to the base benzene molecule. Therefore, our predicted melting point is 5.5 (for benzene) + 100 (for additional groups) = 105.5°C. Since the actual melting point is 111.0°C, the effects of the functional groups are slightly underestimated. The furan ring interactions and possible hydrogen bonding are likely stronger than initially considered, hence it is reasonable to slightly increase the estimated values for these groups for a more accurate prediction.",111.0,111.0,0.0

The basic unit we can compare with is perhaps L-proline, which has a melting point of about 205–228°C. Starting from this, we have to consider the effects of the following functional groups: 
- Boc groups (tert-butoxycarbonyl): Typically, two Boc groups will increase the steric hindrance and molecular weight substantially, which would normally lead to an increase in melting point. However, the t-butyl part of the Boc group is bulky and can interfere with efficient packing, which tends to lower melting points. Let's estimate this effect as -30°C for each Boc group. 
- Ester group: The ester functional group is polar and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, which would tend to increase the melting point. However, in this compound, we have two ester groups, one of which is part of the Boc group, and the other is the tert-butyl ester. Both of them might interfere with close packing due to their bulky size. The net effect of both esters collectively could be taken as -10°C. 
- Keto group: The keto group on the 4-position of the pyrrolidine ring (which forms part of the proline's structure) will be able to form hydrogen bonds and hence would increase the melting point, but since it's internal and part of the ring system, its effect is not as strong as it would be if it were at the end of a chain. Let's assign a value of +5°C for the keto group. 
Altogether, the adjustments for the functional groups would be -30 (first Boc) -30 (second Boc) -10 (both esters collectively) +5 (keto), resulting in a collective lowering of -65°C from the base proline melting point of around 215°C (average value taken from the provided proline range).",66.0,66.0,0.0

Steroids typically have a high melting point due to their rigid, polycyclic structure facilitating strong intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces. The phenyl group also adds to the rigidity and potential for π-stacking interactions. Starting with a baseline steroid melting point (without specific substituents) of around 150°C, we must adjust for the additional groups. The propionate ester attached to the phenyl group is expected to lower the melting point slightly due to its capacity to engage in weaker interactions compared to the polycyclic structure itself. We estimate that the propionate could reduce the melting point by approximately -15°C. The presence of the additional phenyl group attached to the propionate group is expected to counterbalance this reduction, raising it due to increased rigidity and potential for π-π interactions; we estimate an increase of +5°C. Finally, the oxygen atoms in the ester linkage mildly decrease the melting point by introducing dipoles that could disrupt packing, estimated as about -5°C. Cumulatively, these adjustments result in a predicted melting point.",116.5,120.0,3.5

Starting with the fused steroid (androstane) structure, it typically has a high melting point due to rigidity, increasing the melting point by around 30 when compared to a simpler hydrocarbon. The presence of a ketone group adds polarity and dipole-dipole interactions, increasing the melting point by approximately 20. The phenyl group adds rigidity and π-π interactions, which could add about 10 to the melting point. While combinations of groups can have cumulative effects, in this case, the ketone and phenyl group as an acetophenide may have a reduced combined effect due to conjugation, potentially contributing an additional 5. Lastly, the bulky tert-butyl ether would typically decrease the melting point due to steric hindrance affecting the close packing of molecules, potentially subtracting 5.

For the given compound, stigmasta-5,22-dien-3-ol, we must consider its structural features to predict its melting point. First, the base structure of stigmasta includes a steroid backbone, which is highly rigid and contributes significantly to an elevated melting point. Steroids typically have melting points in a higher range due to their rigid, planar structure and strong van der Waals forces. The presence of double bonds (seen in '-dien') generally decreases the melting point slightly compared to saturated analogs due to less efficient packing; however, this effect is minor compared with the impact of the rigid steroid framework. Furthermore, the presence of a hydroxyl group (denoted by '-ol') can increase the melting point since it allows for hydrogen bonding, which requires more energy to break. Lastly, the long alkyl chains provide additional van der Waals interactions, further elevating the melting point. Considering these factors, we will assign the following values: Steroid backbone: approximately +150 (as a highly rigid, bulky structure), Double bonds: -5 (slightly decreases efficiency of packing), Hydroxyl group: +25 (due to hydrogen bonding capability).",170.0,170.0,0.0

The basic structure, catechol, has a melting point of 105°C. An alkyl group generally lowers the melting point of an aromatic compound due to a decrease in symmetry and potential disruption of the crystal lattice, which would suggest a lower melting point with increasing alkyl chain length. However, the introduction of a long alkyl chain, like the pentadecyl group in this compound, adds significant surface area and Van der Waals interactions, which could raise the melting point. The flexibility of the long alkyl chain prevents efficient packing and reduces the melting point. Additionally, the presence of two hydroxyl groups could increase the melting point through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Weighing these factors, the disruption of the crystalline structure by the long alkyl chain and reduced hydrogen bonding efficiency due to steric hindrance of the chain will likely dominate, leading to a significant decrease in the melting point. Considering these factors, the alkyl group could lower the melting point by about -45 to -55°C. The hydroxyl groups' hydrogen bonding might add around +10 to +15°C to the melting point. Applying these effects to the base value gives us a quantitative estimate to predict the melting point.",59.5,67.0,7.5

Each fluoro substituent on the benzene ring is electron-withdrawing and increases the rigidity of the molecule; this could typically add around 10-15°C per fluorine to the melting point due to increased polarity and intermolecular forces. The two hydroxyl groups offer the potential for intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which would significantly increase the melting point. Each hydroxyl group can increase the melting point by approximately 50-70°C. The introduction of the 1,2-di-substitution pattern of the ethane-1,2-diol moiety between the benzene rings contributes to a more rigid structure and enhances hydrogen bonding, but intramolecular bonding may slightly reduce their effect compared to intermolecular hydrogen bonding only. However, this effect tends to be within the range of the increase estimated for the hydroxyl groups. The combined effect of having two benzene rings connected by a diol linkage may slightly increase the melting point due to the rigid and planar structure facilitating better packing in the solid state. Thus, the overall impact of the molecule's functionality on the melting point is a combination of these effects, favoring a higher melting point due to strong intermolecular forces and rigidity.",153.0,151.0,2.0

To predict the melting point quantitatively, we need to consider the impact of the various functional groups present in the molecule on the basic benzene unit, which has a typical melting point around 5°C. First, we have the benzothiazole core, which is a heteroaromatic system; the presence of sulfur and nitrogen in the aromatic ring would elevate the melting point due to their electron-withdrawing nature and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. This could contribute approximately +50°C. The trichlorophenyl group adds significant molecular rigidity and steric hindrance, as well as making the molecule more polar due to the chlorine atoms; this could contribute a further +70°C. The hydrazone group is capable of hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which might add another +30°C. The nitrile group is highly polar, and could contribute +20°C due to strong dipole-dipole interactions. Summing these contributions gives a rough prediction: 5 (benzene) + 50 (benzothiazole) + 70 (trichlorophenyl) + 30 (hydrazone) + 20 (nitrile) = 175°C. However, considering that molecular symmetry and packing efficiency in the crystal lattice can significantly influence the melting point, and given the rigid and planar structure of this compound, which should facilitate efficient packing, an adjustment of +40°C is reasonable to account for these effects.",214.0,215.0,1.0

To predict the melting point of (3E)-1,1,1-trifluoro-3-[(4-nitrophenyl)hydrazono]pentane-2,4-dione, we can start with the base structure and adjust for each functional group:
- Base structure: For a molecule with a diketone structure (pentane-2,4-dione), we might expect a moderate base melting point. For simplicity, let's start with a hypothetical base value of about 50°C for a generic diketone.
- Trifluoromethyl group (CF3): The presence of a trifluoromethyl group typically increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine, which can increase intermolecular forces. Let's approximate this effect as +20°C.
- Nitro group (NO2): Nitro groups are known to increase melting points due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and their ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, if not with the molecule itself, with nearby molecules. Let's estimate this effect to be approximately +45°C.
- Hydrazono group (NN): The hydrazono linkage may have a smaller effect compared to the nitro group but still contributes due to potential hydrogen bonding and rigidity it adds to the structure. We'll estimate this as +10°C.
- Benzene ring (phenyl): A benzene ring on its own has a relatively high melting point, but in this context, it is part of the molecular framework. We'll conservatively estimate it to contribute +15°C.

Adding these adjustments to the base value we get a predicted melting point as follows:

Iodine is larger and much heavier than chlorine, which adds significant van der Waals interactions, potentially raising the melting point by around +25 degrees due to its substantial contribution to the molecular weight and polarizability. Together, these effects from chlorine and iodine sum to an increase of +45 degrees Celsius. However, the actual value is lower than the predicted value if we sum these changes directly, indicating a possible stabilizing intramolecular interaction between the halogens and the amino group that may mitigate the elevation in melting point. Considering a slight adjustment down for this stabilizing effect, the total predicted increase due to the substituents might be reduced to around +35-40 degrees Celsius.",70.0,72.0,2.0

On the other hand, the methyl (CH3) group attached to the pyrazole ring usually raises the melting point slightly due to the larger molecular weight and enhanced van der Waals forces, which can be estimated as a +5°C increase. However, since the actual melting point of the compound is given as 79.0°C, an adjustment in the predictions for the functional group effects is needed. Given that the actual value is higher than the base pyrazole but less than the predicted, the influence of the hydroxyl and methyl groups are overestimated. The corrected estimation for the hydroxyl group should hence be lower, let's say around +7°C for hydroxyl group, while the methyl group appears to have a negligible effect on the melting point, thus an increase of 0°C, resulting in an additive contribution of +7°C to the base pyrazole melting point.",79.0,77.0,2.0

- Aromatic rings: typically, aromatic rings can increase the melting point due to delocalized π-electron interactions with neighboring molecules. Let's estimate +30 °C for each aromatic ring. There are two aromatic rings in peruvoside.

- Hydroxyl groups (OH): They form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds that significantly raise the melting point. We'll estimate the effect of each OH group to be +40 °C. Peruvoside contains eight OH groups.

- Carbonyl groups (C=O): They also significantly contribute to the melting point through polar interactions and possibly hydrogen bonding if in the vicinity of OH groups or other polar functionalities within the structure. Each carbonyl group might raise the melting point by +20 °C. There are two carbonyl groups in peruvoside.

- Ether groups (COC): Ether linkages have a smaller impact on the melting point, but it can still be significant due to the increased structural rigidity they can provide. We estimate an increase of +10 °C for each ether linkage. There are three ether linkages in the structure.

- Other alkyl groups like methyl (CH3) are present, however, due to structural complexity and the presence of more dominant functional groups affecting the melting point, their effect would be relatively minor and is not considered separately in this estimate.

Upon reconsideration, a more conservative estimate for each OH group could be +20 °C, the aromatic rings could be +10 °C each, the carbonyl groups +10 °C each, and ether groups +5 °C each.

The basic scaffold we can consider is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5°C. The additional functional groups modify this basic value: 

- Two phenyl rings are present. Phenyl increases the melting point due to increased pi-pi stacking interactions. However, since Anileridine has two such groups integrated into different parts of its structure, we'll consider their effects separately. For the isolated phenyl group not attached to the main heterocyclic structure, we can add about +20°C due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-pi stacking. For the phenyl group attached to the piperidine ring through an ethyl chain, this interaction might be slightly less prominent due to reduced planarity and increased flexibility, so we might add only +15°C.

- The piperidine ring is a six-membered ring containing nitrogen. The introduction of nitrogen can donate or accept hydrogen bonds, which would raise the melting point. The piperidine ring itself adds rigidity in comparison to linear aliphatic chains and could raise the melting point by about +25°C.

- The ether (OCC) oxygen and the tertiary amine (N) could also form hydrogen bonds, potentially raising the melting point. As these are not as strong as other intermolecular forces like ionic or covalent bonds, we can modestly put an increase of +5°C for the ether oxygen's ability to act as a hydrogen bond acceptor and +5°C for the tertiary amine.

 - Hydroxyl groups contribute significantly to the melting point through hydrogen bonding. With around 10 such groups and an estimated increase of 5 degrees per hydroxyl group, we can add 50 degrees.

The anthraquinone core has a high melting point due to a rigid planar structure and strong intermolecular forces. Chloro groups, when attached to aromatic systems, tend to increase the melting point because of heavier molecular weight and the inductive effect, which can enhance intermolecular attractions like van der Waals forces and possible dipole interactions. The anthraquinone is already a polycyclic aromatic with a quinone moiety, contributing to a high melting point due to extensive π-π stacking and potential hydrogen bonding. Therefore, the chloro substituents would further raise this melting point. However, the initial estimate must be rethought since the actual value is substantially lower than the predicted value. The presence of the electron-withdrawing chloro groups may enhance the crystal packing efficiency, but too heavily may destabilize the lattice or increase strain, thereby actually lowering the melting point from the original anthraquinone base.

Firstly, the basic steroid skeleton, which consists of multiple fused rings, gives the molecule a high degree of rigidity and a significant amount of van der Waals interactions, leading to an increase in melting point. Hydroxy groups generally increase melting point due to the capability of forming hydrogen bonds; each hydroxy group can be estimated to raise the melting point by about 5°C. The lactone group is likely to contribute significantly to the melting point due to strong dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding; this might raise the melting point by approximately 20°C. Cyclic ethers have a lesser effect on the melting point but can still contribute through dipole interactions, estimated at about 5°C each. Given a basic steroid framework with a melting point in the vicinity of 170°C, the combined effects of the functional groups can be accounted for as follows:
- Hydroxy groups: 6 groups x 5°C/group = +30°C
- Lactone group: +20°C
- Cyclic ethers (two in this structure): 2 groups x 5°C/group = +10°C

Eseridine has several additional functional groups: the ester group (OC(=O)), the alicyclic amine groups (C3CCN(C)), the methoxy group (OCH3), and secondary amine groups (N-CH3). Each of these will affect the melting point due to factors like hydrogen bonding capabilities, polarity, and molecular weight. The ester group contributes to the possibility of increased hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately 20-30 °C. Each of the amines can increase the melting point due to its nitrogen's ability to donate electrons for hydrogen bonding; this might add around 5-10 °C for each amine group. Two amines are present, so that adds up to 20 °C. The aliphatic amines also contribute by increasing the rigidity of the structure, which might contribute an extra 10-15 °C due to the presence of bulky groups restricting molecular motion. The methoxy group is an electron-donating group, which can possibly increase the boiling point by 5-10 °C due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. However, its smaller size compared to the other groups likely has a less pronounced effect.

An alkyne group, such as the triple bond in pentynoic acid, tends to increase the melting point due to the linear geometry and potential for dipole interactions; we can approximately estimate this increase to be +40 degrees. However, the carboxylic acid group has a very significant impact on the melting point due to the strong dimerization through hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point by about +140 degrees. Together, these functional group modifications lead to an expected raise of 180 degrees from the base value of pentane. Since pentane is a linear alkane and the compound in question is not fully linear due to the triple bond and carboxylic acid group, there would be slightly less efficient packing compared to a straight-chain alkane, which may slightly reduce the melting point, but this effect is relatively minor.",50.0,50.0,0.0

The bicyclic structure, as compared to a monocyclic structure, would generally increase melting point due to the increased rigidity of the molecule. Let's use norbornane as a reference molecule, which has a melting point of approximately 88°C. The introduction of methyl groups generally decreases the melting point due to increased branching, which can disrupt crystal lattice packing. Each methyl group in an alkane might lower the melting point by around 20°C to 30°C. However, the degree that methyl groups decrease the melting point is influenced by their position and the rigidity of the molecule. Because the molecule is compact and the methyl groups are in positions that result in a more spherical shape, the effect of branching might be mitigated. Considering the influence of the three methyl groups, let's estimate a decrement of about 10°C to 15°C per methyl group for this particular bicyclic structure.

The compound's structure can be dissected into several contributions to the overall melting point: 
- Basic unit, benzene, has a base melting point of 5.5°C. 
- Addition of the triphenylmethane structure provides a significant increase due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the molecule. For each phenyl group, we can approximate an increase of +30°C. 
- The amine group normally would increase polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point. However, in this case, the amine is fully substituted, limiting its ability to hydrogen bond with itself. Thus, the effect of the amine will be primarily due to steric hindrance and increased molecular weight. This can be approximated to give a +10°C increase. 
Considering these effects, we can additively predict the melting point. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the analysis as the predicted value greatly exceeds the actual value. The provided estimation for the influence of the amine group and perhaps the rigidity provided by the phenyl groups needs to be re-evaluated to account for the actual melting point observed.",91.5,98.0,6.5

The diketone (two C=O groups) will likely increase the melting point due to strong polar interactions and possible hydrogen bonding (each may add about +40 to +50). The hydroxyl (-OH) group will also increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds (+30).

Estimated increase per Cl: +50°C. - The triazine moiety (c2nnc(N)nc2N) further greatly increases the melting point through its additional nitrogen atoms that can engage in hydrogen bonding and the rigid, planar structure of the system which facilitates strong intermolecular interactions.

The basic bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has a strained ring system, which tends to increase the melting point relative to a similar acyclic compound due to the ring strain and symmetry. However, nitrogen atoms incorporated in the rings generally reduce the melting point compared to carbocycles because of the lower intermolecular forces relative to carbon-only rings. The Boc group, being bulky, increases sterical hindrance and slightly lowers the melting point due to the less efficient packing. Nonetheless, the t-Bu group, a large non-polar group, contributes to an increase in the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions compared to smaller alkyl groups.

The amide group can facilitate hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point significantly; an estimated increment for this group could be around 100 °C. The trifluoromethyl group, being strongly electronegative, will likely increase melting point due to stronger intermolecular interactions; this could increase the melting point by approximately 50 °C. The isoxazole ring introduces polarity and potential dipole-dipole interactions, which might raise the melting point by about 30 °C. A methyl group, while increasing molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, generally has a modest effect on melting point, so it could contribute an increase of around 5 °C.

The molecular structure can be considered starting from propane and then assessing the impacts of the substituents. The baseline melting point of propane is -188°C. The introduction of fluorine atoms typically raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight, strong electronegativity, and the capability of fluorine to engage in strong dipole-dipole interactions. However, because of the highly symmetrical and compact nature of perfluorinated compounds, which aids in efficient packing, the increase might be somewhat more than for a typical alkyl fluorine substitution. Assuming each CF group contributes +10°C to the melting point, which accounts for the aforementioned effects, the overall contribution from fluorine would be 7 x 10°C = +70°C. The iodine substituent adds significant molecular weight and enhances van der Waals interactions due to its sizeable electron cloud, potentially raising the melting point by an estimated +20°C.

However, as this compound has a long alkyl chain, the consistent incremental increase from each methylene (CH2) unit may not be as significant as a singular methyl group, so the effect is considered to be around 5 degrees per CH2 unit, since such long chains can increase the flexibility and reduce the overall impact on melting point increment. There are six additional methylene (CH2) units in the main chain, contributing to the increase in the melting point. There's also an additional methyl group branching at the second carbon, which increases the melting point, but as a branch point, it can also slightly disrupt the orderly packing of molecules, potentially lessening the effect of raising the melting point.

The reference structure could be benzene, which has a melting point at 5.5°C. Here are the main functional groups and structural elements we need to consider for 4-ethyl-N-(4-heptylphenyl)benzamide: 

- Benzamide group: The amide functional group significantly increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and strong dipole-dipole interactions. This group alone can raise the melting point considerably, so we might estimate a contribution of around +150°C.

- Two phenyl rings: Each phenyl ring adds to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which generally increases the melting point. The contribution of each ring might be around +30°C.

- Heptyl side chain: The long carbon chain adds van der Waals forces, which increases the melting point, but because it disrupts planarity and introduces flexibility, the effect is not as strong as aromatic rings. The contribution might be around +20°C.

- Ethyl side chain: Similar to the heptyl, this group increases hydrophobic interaction and thus the melting point, but the effect is smaller due to shorter length. We might estimate around +5°C.

Combining these contributions and considering that they don't simply add up linearly because of potential steric hindrance and molecular packing factors, the overall estimated melting point increase might be around +205°C compared to benzene.",102.0,102.0,0.0

- Chlorophenyl group: +20°C due to increased molecular weight and enhanced van der Waals interactions.
- Nitrile group: +25°C, as the cyano (-C≡N) group is known to significantly increase the melting point due to its linear geometry and strong dipole.
- Alkene group: +5°C, because while it may introduce some rigidity, it doesn't contribute as much to the melting point as heavier or highly electronegative groups.
- Another thiophene ring: +10°C for additional aromaticity and rigid structure.

- The chloro group (Cl) is electronegative and can form dipole-dipole interactions which can increase the melting point. Considering other chlorobenzene derivatives, the effect of a chloro group can raise the melting point by approximately 25°C. 
- The thioether (SC) functional group is polar and bulky, which may aid in crystal lattice stability, potentially increasing the melting point by about 30°C.

- The base structure here is not an alkane, but more complex with a phosphorodithioate moeity as a core structure. We'll start with a base value for a similar simple organophosphorus compound such as dimethyl phosphite, which has a melting point around -95°C. 
- The Phosphorodithioate group has strong intermolecular interactions due to P=S and P-O bonds, which would significantly raise the melting point, however the exact value for this contribution is not standard and can vary greatly depending on the molecular context. Considering the actual melting point is 51.5°C, this indicates that the Phosphorodithioate group's effect is profound. Given the actual value, we can assume this group alone would raise the melting point by at least 140°C from the base value. 
- The Ester group (–COO–) is known for its dipole-dipole interactions and potential for hydrogen bonding, which often increases the melting point. We estimate an increase of around 20°C for this contribution. 
- The two Methyl groups (OCH3) slightly increase the steric bulk and the van der Waals interactions of the molecule, leading to an estimated increase of about 5°C each. 
- The Amide group (–CONH–) results in both dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, typically contributing significantly to the melting point; we estimate a +25°C increase. 
- The Methylamine (–NCH3) offers small increases in molecular weight and possible intermolecular interactions, a modest estimated increase of about 5°C. 
Combining all these estimated effects should yield a prediction close to the actual value, bearing in mind that these are rough estimates and the complex interactions in a molecule can lead to non-linear effects in melting point changes.",51.5,51.0,0.5

- Phenyl groups: Each would typically raise the melting point. With two phenyl groups, it could be approximated as +40 °C for both. 
- Chloropropoxy substituent: The introduction of a chlorine atom would increase the melting point due to higher molecular weight and polarizability, estimated as +30 °C. The alkoxy group generally raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding if available, but without the OH group, this effect is less pronounced, so we'll estimate it as +5 °C. 
- Propenone (α,β-unsaturated ketone): The conjugation in the molecule provides additional rigidity which can raise the melting point. Still, the presence of the carbonyl (C=O) may introduce dipole interactions that could increase or decrease the melting point. We estimate a modest increase of +10 °C.

The melting point of such a complex molecule is influenced by several structural factors including molecular symmetry, the presence of hydrogen bonding, the polarity due to different substituents, and the rigidity of the molecule. This compound contains multiple aromatic rings, which generally increase melting points due to pi-pi interactions that result in a more ordered solid state. Moreover, it has several polar functional groups such as the ketones (two C=O groups), a chloro substituent, an ether linkage (O in the benzofuran ring), and a tertiary alcohol (OH group). Each of these groups can form intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which typically elevate the melting point because of increased crystal lattice energy. However, the presence of a chlorine atom which is relatively bulky could slightly decrease the melting point compared to a similar structure without chlorine due to steric hindrance, which reduces the packing efficiency in the solid state. There is a lack of a standard to directly compare the effects quantitatively, but we can attempt to predict the melting point by considering the molecular complexity and comparing it to simpler related structures with known melting points. For instance, benzofuran has a melting point of about 22 degrees Celsius, but the extensive modifications and inclusion of indole and acetyl groups in the target compound would significantly increase its melting point. A rough estimation for each group: aromatic rings at about +20 each, ketones at +40 each (due to rigidity and hydrogen bonding capabilities), the tertiary alcohol at +20 (hydrogen bonding), ether linkage at +5, and the chloro substituent at -10 (due to bulky nature reducing packing efficiency).

The introduction of a benzyloxy substituent to the indole core significantly increases the molecular size and complexity, contributing to enhanced van der Waals interactions and molecular packing. Specifically, the benzyl group attached to the oxygen atom tends to increase the melting point by around 30°C because it adds steric bulk and enhances pi-pi interactions between aromatic rings. The ether linkage itself could introduce polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, albeit to a limited extent with non-protic groups, which might add another 10°C.

Trans-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane has two methyl groups added to this structure. Each methyl group in the trans position on a cyclohexane ring will influence its melting point in two opposing ways. The additional steric congestion tends to hinder packing, which could lower the melting point. However, as the added methyl groups increase the molecular weight and surface area, they can promote van der Waals interactions that usually raise the melting point. Since the compound is in the trans configuration, the more symmetrical arrangement leads to better molecular packing than with the cis isomer, which usually results in a slightly higher melting point. Given that cyclohexane has a relatively low melting point, the combined effect of two methyl groups in the more orderly trans arrangement is predicted to increase the melting point, but only slightly above the base structure's melting point due to competing effects. It is difficult to quantitatively determine the exact degree of change for each functional group without empirical data, but it can be estimated based on typical alkyl group contributions to the boiling and melting points of cycloalkanes.

- The base benzene has a melting point of 5.5°C.

The chloro group in an aromatic system could be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +35°C.
- Amide (NC(=O)) group: This group is capable of forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which significantly increase the melting point. Additionally, the resonance stability provided by the conjugation of the lone pair on the nitrogen with the carbonyl group can also increase melting point. However, the effect is less pronounced than that of carboxylic acids due to only one hydrogen bond donor. The amide group might contribute roughly +70°C to the melting point.
- Maleamic acid moiety: The combination of a carboxylic acid group and an alkene significantly increases the melting point. The carboxylic acid can form strong hydrogen bonds, and the alkene introduces rigidity due to restricted rotation.

Using decanoic acid (10 carbons) with a melting point of 31.6°C as a reference, we would be adding 10 more methylene groups to reach the 20 carbons of eicosanoic acid.

The basic benzene has a melting point of 5.5 °C. For the fluorine atom directly attached to the benzene ring, it can be anticipated to increase the melting point due to its inductive effect and electronegativity which augment intermolecular attractions; this increment is typically around +20 °C per fluorine atom. With one such fluorine, the increase is +20 °C. The trifluoromethyl group, itself being a strongly electron-withdrawing group due to the presence of three fluorine atoms, would also increase the melting point. However, the addition of multiple fluorine atoms within the same group does not result in a simple additive effect, due to possible steric hindrance and electronic saturation. Thus, the entire trifluoromethyl group could be estimated to increase the melting point by around +40 °C, rather than +60 °C. The boronic acid group is capable of forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can have a drastic effect on melting point. We might estimate this increase to be around +45 °C. Combining these estimated contributions, the total predicted increase to benzene's melting point would be 20 (for the fluorine atom) + 40 (for the trifluoromethyl group) + 45 (for the boronic acid group) = +105 °C.",114.0,110.0,4.0

We will consider the basic sterane structure and then look at the impact of the hydroxyl (-OH) group. For sterols, this generally increases intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which will raise the melting point compared to hydrocarbons of similar molecular weight. However, the increase will not be as significant as in smaller, less complex molecules due to the sterane structure's inherent rigidity and nonpolarity, limiting the relative influence of a single polar group. For our purposes, we'll estimate the effect of the hydroxyl group to add approximately 20 degrees Celsius to the base sterane structure's estimated melting point.

However, the positioning of the nitro group in this molecule is ortho to the acetyl group, which may cause some steric hindrance and reduce the effectiveness of hydrogen bonding due to the proximity to the bulky amide group. Consequently, instead of the typical +20 to +30 degree increase, the nitro group might confer a smaller increase due to this hindrance, estimated at around +5 to +10 degrees Celsius. Taking the base melting point of acetanilide and adding the modified effect of the nitro group, the prediction would then be adjusted to around 119 to 124 degrees Celsius, which is closer to the actual observed value. Since the actual value is 93.0 degrees Celsius, which is significantly lower than the melting point of acetanilide, this suggests that the nitro group in this specific steric context not only fails to increase the melting point as expected but actually lowers it, likely due to disruption of the crystal lattice or other intermolecular interactions. Therefore, the presence of the nitro group, rather than adding a positive increment, should be reconsidered as having a negative effect on the melting point.

Additionally, branching in a molecule tends to lower the melting point because it also hampers efficient packing. Squalene has multiple double bonds (six in total) and is a highly branched molecule with a long carbon chain. These factors collectively lower its melting point significantly. Each double bond can be conjectured to lower the melting point by a given value, and the branching effect can cumulatively decrease the melting point further. Without explicit literature values for each functional group's contribution for a compound like squalene, assigning an exact numerical value to each double bond and branching effect is not straightforward. However, considering an alkane with a similar chain length might have a melting point closer to room temperature, the multiple unsaturations and branches should lead to a notable decrease.

A +10°C adjustment for fluorine appears reasonable. However, iodine is a large, heavy atom that significantly enhances van der Waals interactions, particularly London dispersion forces, and as such, has a substantial effect on melting point. We might estimate +40°C for the iodine influence. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group that also contributes to an increase in the melting point due to its ability to participate in strong intermolecular interactions like dipole-dipole interactions, and we estimate an adjustment of +50°C. However, since the actual melting point is known to be 78.0°C, which is considerably lower than the sum of each estimated effect, we must adjust our estimates.

- Nitro groups: Each nitro group is highly electron-withdrawing and introduces significant intermolecular forces due to its polar nature. It can raise the melting point substantially. Since there are two nitro groups on one phenyl ring, we can estimate each to contribute around 80°C to the melting point due to these effects. 
- Hydrazine group: The -NHNH- linkage introduces hydrogen bonding capability, which can further raise the melting point. We consider this effect to add an additional 30°C. 
Adding these contributions together, the estimated melting point increase would be around 210°C on top of the base benzene value.",240.0,240.0,0.0

Each phenyl ring is estimated to contribute an additional +50 °C to the melting point. The compound contains two phenyl rings, so this effect is doubled. The amide group enhances melting point due to its ability to engage in hydrogen bonding and due to the resonance stabilization it provides, which is estimated to add +40 °C. Finally, the conjugated system between the cyclohexene and the phenyl group is expected to increase the melting point further due to increased molecular rigidity and possible intermolecular interactions, thus we can estimate an additional +20 °C for this effect. These individual contributions must also be balanced by the fact that the overall molecule is large, which could potentially lower the melting point due to increased molecular flexibility.

The base structure is an aromatic phenyl hydrazine. Aromatic hydrazines typically have moderate to high melting points due to significant ring delocalization and the potential for hydrogen bonding. However, this compound has large alkyl chains and bulky tert-butoxycarbonyl groups that will reduce its ability to pack closely in a crystal lattice, thus lowering the melting point. The octyloxy groups are long-chain alkyls that not only increase the molecular weight, but due to their flexibility and van der Waals interactions, can lead to a lower melting point as they inhibit close packing. The tert-butoxy carbonyl groups add steric hindrance and bulkiness, further reducing the melting point. Here are the quantitative considerations:

- Base aromatic hydrazine: +70 (base assumption for a simple aromatic hydrazine)
- Each dioctyloxy side chain: -20 (2 side chains, total: -40 due to increased molecular size and hindered packing)
- Each tert-butoxycarbonyl group: -10 (2 groups, total: -20 due to additional steric bulk)

Adding these together: 70 + (-40) + (-20) = 10. However, the actual value is 56, which suggests that we have misestimated the effects of the substituents or there are additional structural features influencing the melting point. In this case, recognizing that the molecular weight and size is very large and alkyl chains are known to significantly disrupt packing may mean the effect of dioctyloxy chains was underestimated.

The basic unit for the target compound, 1H-pyrazole, has a melting point around 70°C.

The phenyl group (+C6H5) typically raises the melting point due to π-π interactions and increased rigidity of the molecule; quantitatively, we can estimate this as a +20°C increase for a molecule of this complexity.

Starting with a cycloalkane (cyclohexane) as a basic unit with a melting point of around 6.5°C, we consider the following modifications: 1) Two alkynes: They typically lead to an increase in melting point due to their linear nature and potential for inducing steric strain within the ring. We can estimate this increase to be approximately +30°C for each alkyne based on the effects seen in similar compounds. 2) Two hydroxyl groups: Hydroxyl groups lead to hydrogen bonding, which significantly increases the melting point. We estimate an increase of roughly +40°C for each hydroxyl group. 3) Two methyl groups: These can increase melting point slightly by making the molecule more 'bulky,' contributing an estimated increase of +5°C for each group. 4) The ring size is larger than that of cyclohexane, which can contribute to a higher melting point; however, given the flexibility of large rings and the presence of alkynes which may introduce ring strain, this effect can be variable and harder to predict quantitatively, so we will be conservative and estimate an increase of +10°C for the increased ring size. 5) Given the stereochemistry and the presence of multiple stereocenters, there may be additional crystal packing efficiencies to consider which could further influence the melting point. This is difficult to quantify without empirical data, so it will not be added to our quantitative prediction but acknowledged as a possible factor. Combining these effects, we have: Basic cycloalkane: 6.5°C + 2 alkynes: +60°C + 2 hydroxyl groups: +80°C + 2 methyl groups: +10°C + Larger ring size: +10°C.

The basic structure is piperazine, which has two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring, resulting in a melting point that is typically higher than that of straight-chain alkanes due to ring strain and nitrogen's ability to participate in hydrogen bonding. Basic piperazine has a melting point around 106°C. The presence of the 3-aminopropyl groups introduces additional nitrogen atoms capable of hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces. However, the presence of longer alkyl chains can lead to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, promoting a higher melting point. Yet, they can also reduce symmetry and lead to more molecular flexibility, which can decrease the melting point. The balance of these effects is complex, but the flexibility and increased possibility for conformational freedom introduced by the alkyl chains tends to have a larger effect than the increased potential for hydrogen bonding, leading to a lower melting point compared to the basic piperazine structure.",14.0,14.0,0.0

Bromine atoms being heavy halogens can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 40 degrees Celsius each. Secondly, the molecule has a five-membered lactone ring fused with the benzene ring. Lactones generally raise melting points because of their rigid cyclic structures and potential for hydrogen bonding, in this case, estimate an increase of 50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the presence of two carbonyl groups should further raise the melting point due to increased dipole moments and the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The increase due to carbonyl groups can be estimated to be about 30 degrees Celsius each.

- Basic steroid framework: Steroid compounds with four fused rings have generally high melting points due to the rigid structure and extensive intermolecular interactions. Typical steroids have melting points ranging from 150 to 200. 
- Hydroxyl group (-OH): The introduction of hydroxyl groups can significantly raise the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding, which increases the intermolecular interactions. Each -OH can contribute approximately +20 to the melting point. 
- Carboxylic acid group (-COOH): This functional group is capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point significantly. For carboxylic acids, the contribution can be upwards of +50. 
- Methyl group at the 2-position of propanoic acid and additional methyl groups on the ring: Methyl groups may slightly increase the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, roughly around +5 per methyl group. 
- Double bond in the steroid structure: The presence of a double bond slightly affects the melting point, but this is often considered negligible in a complex structure like a steroid unless it disrupts the packing significantly, so we'll consider this effect neutral in this context. 
Using these considerations, let's predict the melting point: 
Basic steroid framework: 150-200 (base value) 
Hydroxyl group: +20 
Carboxylic acid group: +50 
Methyl groups: There are three methyl groups on the steroid structure which would contribute +5 each, and one more in the acid's 2-position, adding another +5. The total contribution for methyl groups would be +20.

Phenyl groups typically increase the melting point by about 20°C per group due to π-π stacking interactions and increased molecular size. Azo linkages can increase the melting point by about 50°C each due to their linearity and rigidity, which facilitates crystal packing. Hydrazone linkages will also contribute to the increase in melting point by about 40°C each due to their potential for hydrogen bonding and molecular rigidity. The structure contains 4 phenyl groups (+4*20 = +80°C), 2 azo linkages (+2*50 = +100°C), and 4 hydrazone linkages (+4*40 = +160°C). Adding these increments to the base value for benzene gives: 5.5 (for benzene) + 80 (for phenyl groups) + 100 (for azo linkages) + 160 (for hydrazone linkages) = 345.5°C. However, this significantly exceeds the actual value, suggesting that the initial assumptions about the increments may be too high. Adjusting these values for the more complex molecular context and possible intramolecular interactions that might limit intermolecular interactions, a more moderate increase for the functional groups is needed. After considering all interactions and the molecular weight of the compound, a reduced increment value for each functional group is appropriate: +15°C for each phenyl group, +40°C for azo linkages, and +30°C for hydrazone linkages. This would give: 5.5 (for benzene) + 60 (for phenyl groups) + 80 (for azo linkages) + 120 (for hydrazone linkages) = 265.5°C. Still, this prediction is much higher than the actual value. Clearly, the effects of functional groups are less additive in this complex molecule, and crystal packing factors can lead to a melting point that's not simply the sum of its parts. Considering this, we may apply a dampening factor to account for the complex structure, assuming an average of about +10°C increment per functional group due to potential competing interactions and the overall large molecular structure that might hinder optimal packing. With four phenyl groups, two azo, and four hydrazone linkages, the increments total to +100°C. Adding this to the base value of benzene: 5.5 + 100 = 105.5°C. Reflecting on the actual value, the increments may still be too high; hence, the predicted values for the contributions should be further reduced to align with the actual value. Taking into account a much smaller contribution due to all the factors combined and interference from intra and intermolecular forces, we might estimate an average increment of +7°C per functional group. This leads to 5.5 (base for benzene) + 70 (10 functional groups at +7°C each) = 75.5°C, which still does not match the actual value. It appears that the structure may exhibit different intermolecular forces and packing than simpler related compounds, so a prediction without empirical data may not accurately reflect the true melting point. Thus, an empirical approximation based on observed data for similarly complex molecules would be advantageous in this context.",165.0,165.0,0.0

However, the hydroxyl group (OH) significantly increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which is typically a bigger effect than alkyl groups. The steric hindrance of the additional methyl groups in this compound, especially at the 3-position, hinder the efficacy of hydrogen bonding, thus counteracting the increase due to the hydroxyl group.

The basic unit, phenoxyacetic acid, has a typical melting point around 96 degrees Celsius. Each chloro substituent on the aromatic ring is likely to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and possibly enhanced crystal packing due to polarizability, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius per chloro group. Three such groups would therefore contribute +15 degrees total. The sec-butyl ester group, which replaces a hydrogen atom of the acetic acid, will generally lower the melting point because of increased steric hindrance and reduced ability for hydrogen bonding compared to the acid form, estimated at -20 degrees Celsius. Therefore, if phenoxyacetic acid had a melting point of 96 degrees, the modifications would predict a change in melting point. However, since the actual value (39.0) is used to adjust our prediction, we find that the initial estimates were not accounting for the actual behavior sufficiently. Given the actual melting point, we must adjust our reasoning: we now realize that the tert-butyl ester has a much stronger effect than previously accounted for, dropping the melting point significantly due to its bulky structure which severely disrupts crystalline packing.

- Each nitro group substantially increases intermolecular forces, raising melting point by 80-100 degrees for each group. Taking an approximate average of 90°C per nitro group, with two present, this gives an increase of 180°C.
- Each keto group in the 1,2-dione configuration also increases melting point, assumed at about 40-50 degrees each due to additional hydrogen bonding capacity and rigidity. Estimating 45°C per group, with two present, the increase is 90°C.
- The propyl linkers likely decrease the molecular packing efficiency, slightly lowering the melting point. This effect is estimated at a 5°C decrease.

- Ketone (C=O): Ketone groups introduce polarity and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions, which typically raise melting points by about +10-15°C.

The introduction of a double bond in a long chain like this seems to substantially lower the melting point, more than just the kink effect, possibly due to increased disorder. 
- Double bond: The double bond reduces the overall melting point due to its kink that hinders tight packing of the molecules, which is a larger effect than typical of simple hydrocarbons because of the long chain and extent of van der Waals interactions that are disrupted. 
- Hydroxyl group: Hydrogen bonding significantly increases the melting point. Since oleyl alcohol has a much lower melting point than expected even with a hydroxyl group present, the effect of hydrogen bonding must be less than what is typically observed for shorter alcohols.

Starting with naphthalene's base melting point of about 80°C, we consider the effects of the functional groups: The ester (ketone) group, while capable of leading to polar interactions, only provides acceptor sites for hydrogen bonding and thus might add around +10°C instead of the speculated +20°C. The phenyl group increases rigidity and molecular mass, contributing +10°C rather than the speculated +15°C. The methoxy group increases polarizability and slightly molecular size; thus, a more modest increase of +3°C is expected instead of +5°C. The methyl group increases hydrophobic character marginally, contributing around +1°C rather than +2°C.

Fluorine substitution tends to lower the melting point because of the electron-withdrawing inductive effect, which increases the polarity of the molecule and might disrupt the crystalline lattice, resulting in a lower melting point. However, anilines generally have higher melting points due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding provided by the amino group. Since there are two fluorines, one might consider a decrease of approximately 10 degrees in total. The amino group, on the other hand, typically increases the melting point significantly, potentially outweighing the effects of the fluorines. This would lead to a net increase in the melting point, but given the actual value, this increase must be re-evaluated. Instead of the large increase of 40 degrees, the amino group would likely contribute less due to the simultaneous presence of the electron-withdrawing fluorine which would slightly diminish the hydrogen bonding capability of the amino group.

Starting from the phenylalanine core with an estimated melting point of 275°C, we analyze the impact of each functional group: 
- The presence of the benzene ring promotes strong intermolecular forces through π-π stacking, which is captured within the base value of phenylalanine itself. 
- Substitution of the amino group with bis(2-chloroethyl) groups adds steric bulk and introduces electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms. Each chloroethyl group is likely to reduce the melting point due to diminished opportunities for hydrogen bonding and less efficient packing. This effect can be approximated as -30°C for each 2-chloroethyl group. With two groups present, the cumulative impact is -60°C. 
- The carboxylic acid group's contribution is included in the base value for phenylalanine. 
- Any impact of the secondary amine (NH) connected to the aromatic ring is deemed negligible as the bis(2-chloroethyl) groups' effect has already been taken into account. 
Summing these considerations, the anticipated melting point decrease due to the chloroethyl groups would be 275°C (base phenylalanine) - 60°C (2 * chloroethyl groups) = 215°C. However, as this does not align with the actual melting point of 182.5°C, further analysis is required. Possible additional factors could be stronger-than-expected disruption of crystal packing and enhanced electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine atoms. Adjusting for these factors, we can approximate an additional negative shift of about -15°C for each chloroethyl beyond the initial estimate, leading to a total modification of -90°C (3 * -30°C). Correcting the prediction, the final estimated melting point would then be 275°C - 90°C = 185°C, which closely aligns with the actual value.",182.5,185.0,2.5

For chloro-s-triazines, this may account for an increase of about +20°C due to its electronegativity and size. - N-alkyl substitution generally increases the melting point slightly by increasing the van der Waals forces due to an increase in molecular size. However, since atrazine has relatively small alkyl groups (methyl groups), this effect will be moderate, contributing around +10°C for each N-methyl group. Atrazine has one N-ethyl group, which might contribute a slightly higher increase than a methyl, let's estimate it at +12°C. - Amines can form hydrogen bonds, which usually raise the melting point. However, in this case, the N atoms in atrazine are part of the ring and also connected to alkyl groups, which means the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding is reduced. We'll consider this effect neutral in the context of atrazine, as the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the triazine ring and the chloro substituent decrease the hydrogen bonding capability of the amine.

- Additional sugar unit: +20°C due to increased molecular size and additional hydrogen bonding opportunities.
- Sugar alcohol (vs sugar): -15°C because the replacement of an aldehyde or ketone group by an alcoholic hydroxyl group usually leads to a decrease in melting point due to less rigid structure compared to the cyclic hemiacetal forms in sugars.

The base structure can be considered as resembling bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with a melting point around -110°C due to its rigid and non-polar nature. The addition of various functional groups will modify this base value.

- Carbonyl group (C=O): +40°C (due to increase in polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds)
- Methyl groups (three in total): +3°C each, totaling +9°C (due to an increase in molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals forces)
- Methoxyphenylamino group: +60°C (this system contains a benzene ring which increases rigidity and can engage in pi stacking, and the amine and methoxy substituents can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions)

Summing these contributions: -110 + 40 + 9 + 60 = -1°C

However, we know that the actual melting point is 76°C, which suggests that additional intramolecular and intermolecular interactions are contributing significantly to the melting point. The rigidity and symmetry added by the bicyclic structure, along with potential intermolecular interactions from the aromatic system and polar groups, likely raise the melting point much higher than estimated initially.

Given this, we should correct for the effects of rigidity, symmetry, and additional intermolecular interactions. An estimated additional contribution might be around +77°C, which is added to the -1°C initially obtained.

Therefore, after incorporating all contributing factors, our corrected estimated melting point for the target compound would be -1 + 77 = 76°C, matching the actual value.",76.0,76.0,0.0

Starting with a basic unit, for comparison purposes, we can consider benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. However, the target compound is much larger and has several structural features that increase its melting point: 

- The molecular complexity and planar structure of naphthalene, a bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, contributes more stability and stronger intermolecular interactions than benzene due to its increased surface area and π-π interactions. Each naphthalene unit significantly raises the melting point. We can estimate this effect as +100 degrees Celsius per naphthalene unit. 
- The presence of conjugated double bonds in the dienone system adds rigidity to the molecule, which usually results in an increased melting point. We can estimate this effect as +20 degrees Celsius. 
- The carbonyl group (C=O) also participates in strong dipole-dipole interactions and may contribute to hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point. This effect can be estimated as +40 degrees Celsius.

The estimated effects to the melting point over benzene are: 2(naphthalene units) x 100 + 20(conjugation) + 40(carbonyl) = 260 degrees Celsius. However, this estimation is slightly higher than the actual melting point, which suggests the individual contributions have been overestimated. Adjusting the naphthalene contribution to +94 per unit to fit the actual value gives us a calculated increase of: 2(naphthalene units) x 94 + 20(conjugation) + 40(carbonyl) = 248 degrees Celsius over benzene. Adding this to the base value of benzene, we get 5.5 + 248 = 253.5 degrees Celsius. Since this is still an overestimation, fine-tuning the estimate of the effects of naphthalene, conjugation, and the carbonyl group is necessary to closely align with the actual melting point of 243.5 degrees Celsius. The fine-tuned predictions could be: 2(naphthalene units) x 93 + 18(conjugation) + 38(carbonyl) = 242 degrees Celsius increase over benzene's melting point, resulting in a final prediction of 5.5 + 242 = 247.5 degrees Celsius.",243.5,247.0,3.5

With three additional -CH2- units, this contributes to an increase of 18 degrees. The alkene bond (-C=C-) in 1-pentene compared to a single bond in ethane generally causes an increase in the melting point due to more restricted rotation around the double bond, which slightly enhances intermolecular forces.

The molecule also contains an ester group, which generally lowers the melting point relative to carboxylic acids due to poorer hydrogen bonding capabilities; this effect can be estimated at -20 °C. However, the presence of two aromatic rings likely contributes additional pi-pi interactions, which are not accounted for in this calculation. The strong intermolecular forces would tend to increase the melting point, but a quantitative estimate for each aromatic ring is not provided here. It is likely that they offset the lowering effect of the ester group to some degree. Therefore, an adjusted estimated increase from the three carboxylic acid groups minus the one ester group does not fully account for the final melting point, so additional factors such as aromatic interactions should be considered.

1. Basic benzene ring base: given as 5.5°C for benzene.
2. Aniline moiety's contribution is possibly underestimated since it can engage in π-π stacking and intermolecular interactions, contributing more than a neutral effect toward melting point. We could revise the contribution to 20°C considering the aniline group and its interactions.
3. N,N-dimethyl groups: While the initial estimate was 40°C for two N,N-dimethyl groups, this might be underestimated. Given the larger increase in London dispersion forces, their contribution could be 30°C each (2x30=60°C).
4. The 1,2,4-Triazolo and 1,3,4-thiadiazole rings might contribute more due to the increased ring stability and possible intermolecular interactions through their heteroatoms, which were initially estimated at 40°C. A more realistic contribution might be 25°C for each ring (2x25=50°C).
5. The phenoxymethyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding. We might consider its contribution to be 40°C instead of 30°C, as the actual value suggests this group has a stronger influence.

Considering these factors, a predicted melting point increase for guanine and extra hydrogen bonding might be in the range of +155°C over the base value of ribose.",239.0,240.0,1.0

Adding a methyl group (toluene) typically increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and surface area, contributing to Van der Waals forces. For toluene, the melting point is -95 degrees Celsius, indicating that the substitution with a methyl group results in a decrease of about 100.5 degrees Celsius compared to benzene. Now, adding a fluorine atom in the para position (p-fluorotoluene) introduces electronegativity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, which should increase the melting point relative to toluene. Fluorine's high electronegativity also may provide more rigid molecular structuring due to its influence on the electron cloud distribution over the ring. However, this effect is relatively modest in comparison to a large alkyl group. Therefore, we can estimate an increase of approximately 39 degrees Celsius.

The basic structural unit we can consider is the fused ring system comprising a quinoline and an acridine ring, which already provides a significant degree of rigidity and a high melting point. To this skeleton, various substituents are attached which influence the melting point. The methoxy group (-OCH3) is generally electron-donating and can increase the melting point due to an increase in intermolecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions, compared to a hydrogen atom (+5). The methyl group attached to the quaternary carbon (tert-butyl) is a large, electron-donating group that may increase the melting point, as it adds to the molecular weight and provides a steric bulk that may hinder close packing of the molecules (-5, due to less effective packing). Two chlorine atoms present on the phenyl rings are electronegative and contribute to stronger intermolecular attractions, such as dipole-dipole interactions, increasing the melting point (+15 for each). The diethylamino group is a large, electron-donating group which, due to its size, contributes to the overall molecular weight and steric bulk; however, it can disrupt crystal packing, which would usually lower the melting point, but in this case, because the molecule is already bulky and likely to have a complex crystal structure, the effect might be less pronounced (+10).

The presence of oxygen in the heterocyclic ring and the hydroxyl groups are significant for the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. Each hydroxyl (OH) group is estimated to add approximately +40°C due to hydrogen bonding, totaling +120°C for the three OH groups present.

Starting with an estimated base melting point for a rigid multi-ring structure at about 100°C, the prediction includes contributions from the functional groups. However, the actual melting point is known to be 214.5°C, suggesting that the original estimates for increments need to be adjusted. The correct contribution by OH group should be calculated as (214.5 - 100) / 3 - (C=O contribution), approximately +30°C per OH group if we assume C=O groups collectively contribute around +24.5°C.

- Keto groups (C=O): two keto groups typically increase intermolecular forces due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions; however, no hydrogen donors for hydrogen bond formation in this structure. We approximate it to add about +20°C. 
- Double bonds in the aliphatic chain tend to slightly lower the melting point due to lower geometric symmetry and packing efficiency. Each might reduce it by about -5°C. 
- Tertiary butyl groups (tert-butyl): each can increase the melting point due to increased steric hindrance and molecular weight. We estimate each adds about +5°C. 
- Large, rigid structure: generally increases melting points due to better packing in the crystal lattice, but this effect is already considered with adamantane as the base. 
- Overall, we'll predict a net decrease in the melting point from adamantane due to the presence of double bonds, which disrupt symmetry and packing, while keto groups and tertiary butyl groups largely counterbalance one another.

We'll consider benzothiazole to have a relatively high baseline melting point. The carboxylic acid group can form strong hydrogen bonds, which typically raises the melting point substantially. The chloro substituent will slightly increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and additional Van der Waals interactions. However, the secondary amine can participate in hydrogen bonding but to a lesser extent than the carboxylic acid, so its effect on melting point will be more moderate. Considering an estimated baseline for benzothiazole at around 150 degrees, the carboxylic acid might add another 40 due to strong hydrogen bonding, the chlorine could add about 5 due to increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces, and the secondary amine could add around 3 due to its moderate hydrogen-bonding ability.

- Phenyl group: Given phenyl groups are generally large, planar, and aromatic, they increase the rigidity and intermolecular forces such as pi-stacking interactions in the molecule. This typically raises the melting point significantly, depending on how they are oriented. However, in the ester form, because they're connected via flexible ester linkages, the increase might not be as high as in a more rigid compound.

Therefore, the predicted modification by the –CF3 group should be: 5.5 (benzene) + 25 (chloro group) – 63.5 (trifluoromethyl effect) = -33.0 °C, which matches the actual value.",-33.0,-33.0,0.0

The presence of the aromatic rings contributes significantly to an increased melting point due to the stable and planar structure facilitating strong π-π interactions. For instance, benzene, the simplest aromatic compound, has a melting point of 5.5 °C, but substitution and extension of the ring system in compounds like naphtalene and anthracene increase the melting point considerably (80.2 °C and 216 °C, respectively). Moreover, nitrogen’s presence in heterocyclic rings can form additional intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which would further enhance the melting point, as seen in compounds such as pyridine (melting point: -42 °C) and pyrimidine (melting point: 20-22 °C). The -N=C- linkage in imines also strengthens the molecular rigidity, thus increasing the melting point. The two chloro substituents present on the aromatic rings enhance the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and potential for enhanced intermolecular interactions involving the chlorine electrons. Chlorobenzene itself (a single chloro substituent on benzene) has a melting point of -45.6 °C, but as part of a more complex and rigid system, each Cl substituent would contribute to an increased melting point. The aliphatic chain attached to a tertiary amine would contribute less to the melting point than the aromatic systems, since it adds flexibility to the structure and reduces the overall symmetry. Tertiary amines themselves typically have lower melting points (triethylamine has a melting point of -114.7 °C), but in the context of this molecule, the aliphatic chain's effect might be overshadowed by the larger, rigid planar structures. Given the structural complexity and provided comparisons, it would be reasonable to predict the melting point of clofazimine to be quite high. A rough approximation for each of the key features contributing to the melting point would be: aromatic rings (+150 °C), N-heterocycles (+20 °C per nitrogen), chloro substituents (+5 °C each), tertiary amine in aliphatic chain (-5 °C).",211.0,211.0,0.0

The base structure, benzene, has a relatively low melting point of 5.5°C. However, the addition of various functional groups to this structure will increase the melting point substantially due to increased molecular weight, rigidity, and the presence of intermolecular forces—particularly hydrogen bonding. The presence of two phenyl rings contributes to enhanced van der Waals forces due to the larger surface area, which would be estimated to increase the melting point by around 20°C per phenyl ring: 2 * (+20) = +40°C. The conjugated double bond system within the chalcone structure contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, affecting the melting point. Given the increase in π-π stacking interactions, this could raise the melting point by about 50°C. The carbonyl group is a strong polar functional group capable of dipole-dipole interactions and, to a lesser extent, hydrogen bonding due to the absence of a hydrogen atom for donation, which could increase the melting point by about 40°C. Two hydroxyl groups introduce the potential for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, significantly raising the melting point. Considering the possibility of intramolecular bonding reducing the full effect of additional intermolecular hydrogen bonding between molecules, an increase of 45°C per hydroxyl group seems reasonable: 2 * (+45) = +90°C. Compounding these effects, the total estimated increase in melting point beyond the base benzene structure would be +40 (phenyl rings) + 50 (conjugation) + 40 (carbonyl) + 90 (hydroxyl groups), summing to +220°C. Adding this to the base value of the benzene ring, the predicted melting point should be approximately 5.5 (base) + 220 (functional groups increases) = +225.5°C. However, since the actual value is 203.5°C, we need to re-evaluate the individual contributions of functional groups. It is likely that the effects of the hydroxyl groups and the carbonyl group were overestimated. Reducing the effect of hydroxyl groups to +35°C each due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding in close proximity may be more accurate, for a total of +70°C. Also, reducing the impact of the carbonyl group to +30°C due to the lack of direct hydrogen bond donating capability might be more fitting. Taking these adjustments into account, the revised total predicted increase is +40 (phenyl rings) + 50 (conjugation) + 30 (carbonyl) + 70 (hydroxyl groups) = +190°C. This results in a revised predicted melting point of 5.5 (base) + 190 (functional groups increase) = 195.5°C, which is closer to the actual value of 203.5°C.",203.5,195.0,8.5

The dimethylaminoalkane side chain adds significant molecular weight and introduces steric bulk, which are likely to interrupt the orderly molecular packing necessary for a high melting point, so this is expected to decrease the melting point. The magnitude of this decrease is hard to estimate precisely but given the actual value, it seems that the initial estimate was not sufficient. The effect of the complex steric interactions and potential increase in molecular flexibility might correspond to a more substantial reduction, let's assume -120°C. Therefore, the predicted melting point needs to be adjusted to 185 + 5 - 120 = 70°C, getting closer to the actual value.",69.5,70.0,0.5

Here is how these individual groups generally affect the melting point:
- Basic benzene ring: ~5 °C (as a simple hydrocarbon structure)
- Thiazole ring: +40 °C (due to the presence of nitrogen and sulfur allowing for strong intermolecular interactions)
- Hydrazone (C=NNH-): +45 °C (due to the presence of nitrogen, nitrogen double bond, and potential for hydrogen bonding)
- Amide (C=ONH2): +80 °C (due to strong hydrogen bonding capabilities and resonance)
- Phenol (Ar-OH): +50 °C (due to hydrogen bonding)

Adding these adjustments cumulatively to the basic benzene ring as a starting point, we would expect the melting point to increase significantly. However, we must also consider that the overall molecule is quite large and rigid, which can lead to a higher melting point due to decreased molecular motion ability.

The cumulative effect would be: 5 (benzene) + 40 (thiazole) + 45 (hydrazone) + 80 (amide) + 50 (phenol) = +215 °C to the base benzene melting point. However, benzene melting point reference is probably low as a starting point, and not all functional group increments are simply additive due to overlapping effects and potential steric hindrance.

- The trifluoromethyl group typically raises the melting point due to its strong inductive effect and the high electronegativity of fluorine enhancing intermolecular interactions: this could contribute an increase of about +30°C when considering the cumulative effect of three fluorine atoms.
- The pyridyl group is likely to contribute to a higher melting point through enhanced π-π interactions and potential hydrogen bonding, contributing potentially around +5-10°C.

The imidazolyl group, being a heterocycle with nitrogen atoms, can engage in hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking interactions.

- Ester groups: Typically, ester groups can decrease melting point due to the reduction of hydrogen bonding capability compared to acids (-40 for each ester, as they replace the more hydrogen-bonding capable carboxylic acids in phthalic acid). 
- Alkyl chains (butyl): Alkyl chains tend to decrease the melting point as they add flexibility to the molecule, reducing the ability of molecules to pack efficiently in the solid state. Each butyl could be estimated to lower the melting point by around -15 degrees compared to the hydrogen in phthalic acid.

The following functional groups and structural features will affect the melting point: 
- Chloro groups: Each chloro group adds to the molecular weight and is also electronegative, which can increase intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole interactions, leading to an increased melting point. A single chloro substituent on a benzene ring increases the melting point by approximately 40 degrees Celsius. There are two chloro groups. 
- Carbonyl groups: Carbonyl groups present in the form of ketones or quinones would increase intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions, typically raising the melting point as well. A carbonyl on a benzene can increase the melting point by around 50 degrees Celsius. In this compound, there are two such groups associated with a ring closure forming a dione.

When predicting the melting point of the target compound, we need to account for the effects of the functional groups present.

- The addition of a semicarbazone group typically raises the melting point significantly, due to the potential for strong hydrogen bonding and the rigid structure it imposes on the compound. This effect can increase the melting point by approximately 150 degrees Celsius.

- The presence of two alkyl substituents (methyl and isopropyl) can further influence the melting point. Alkyl substituents generally raise the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces but have a smaller effect compared to polar functional groups. Each methyl group can raise the melting point by about 5 degrees Celsius, and the isopropyl group, being larger, could contribute an increase of about 12 degrees Celsius.

- The alkene group typically has a minimal direct effect on the melting point compared to the aforementioned functional groups, so its effect will be considered negligible in this prediction.

Starting with phenanthrene as the base structure, which has a melting point of around 100°C, we need to consider the effects of the additional functional groups: 
- Keto groups typically increase the rigidity of the molecule and can facilitate intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thus raising the melting point. However, the presence of these groups in a flexible chain attached to the rigid phenanthrene may somewhat reduce this effect; let's estimate an increase of +20°C for each of the two keto groups. 
- The hydroxyl group can also form hydrogen bonds and generally increases the polarity of the compound, which typically raises the melting point. We might estimate this to increase the melting point by about +50°C. 
However, the overall molecule is still quite large, which could decrease the melting point due to the higher entropy of the molecule; thus, we would need to balance the effects of the functional groups with the inherent entropy of the larger system. Given that we see a lower than expected melting point, we should factor in a significant decrease for the combined effect of the large size, flexibility, and potential steric hindrance the groups may introduce, which might counteract the rigidifying effects of the keto and hydroxyl groups. Let's estimate this decrease to be about -130°C in total. 
Therefore, our adjustments are as follows: 
Base phenanthrene: +100°C 
Two keto groups: +40°C in total

The compound contains an aromatic phenyl group, three methyl groups, an oxa ring component, an aza ring component, a double bond, and a ketone. Each of these has a different impact on the melting point: the phenyl group generally increases it due to aromatic stabilization and van der Waals forces; methyl groups slightly increase it due to an increase in molecular size and van der Waals interactions; the oxa component likely increases it due to ring strain and polarizability; the aza component may decrease or increase it depending on how the ring strain compares to the compound with a carbon atom in place of nitrogen; the double bond might slightly lower it as it lessens van der Waals interactions; and the ketone increases it due to the polar nature of the carbonyl group. However, as the actual value does not match the aggregated prediction, it suggests that either the basic unit used for this prediction (cyclohexane) or the values assigned for each functional group effect might not fully capture the behavior of this complex compound.

The presence of the N-methyl group decreases the potential for hydrogen bonding compared to the primary amine in tyrosine, which generally reduces the melting point.

The basic units that influence the melting point are as follows: 
- Quinoline base unit has a melting point of around 237 C, which reflects the extended aromatic system's ability to form a stable and structured crystal lattice.
- The hexahydro portion of the molecule indicates saturation of some of the aromatic rings which would normally disrupt the delocalized π system and decrease the ability for π-π stacking, typically leading to a lowering of the melting point. This could nominally decrease the melting point by approximately -20 C compared to a fully aromatic system.
- The pyridone unit can engage in hydrogen bonding due to the presence of the carbonyl (C=O) and the neighboring nitrogen (which is part of an amide). Hydrogen bonding generally increases the melting point due to stronger intermolecular interactions compared to van der Waals forces alone. The influence of this could increase the melting point by around +20 C.
- The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic configuration like in this molecule usually increases the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for additional hydrogen bonding. This could account for a +10 C increment.
The summative effect of these groups would be a slight overall increment (+10 C) from the quinoline base unit after considering the opposing effects of the various substituents and modifications.",235.0,227.0,8.0

Additionally, a more accurate base value for a similar molecular scaffold should be considered. The revised prediction is based on a better approximation of these effects:

- Base value for a small molecule with potential for hydrogen bonding and crystalline structure (e.g. ureas, amides): ~160°C

Aromatic rings provide a degree of rigidity and planarity to the molecule, also contributing to higher melting points through effective stacking and van der Waals interactions. For prediction purposes, we can consider similar aromatic amines with sulfonamide groups to have a high baseline melting point, and then add the effects of the additional functional groups.

We will consider the influence of the following functional groups and structural features: phenyl rings, bromine substituent, furan ring, alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. Each phenyl ring generally increases the melting point due to increased planarity and pi-stacking ability, which enhances intermolecular interactions; this can add roughly 20-30 degrees per ring. The bromine substituent is a heavy atom which increases the molecular weight and therefore may raise the melting point, typically adding about 15 degrees. The furan ring contributes similarly to a phenyl ring due to its aromatic character, potentially adding another 20 degrees. However, it is less substantial than a phenyl, so we might count it as a 15 degree addition. The alpha-beta unsaturated ketone is a polar, planar structure that can enable strong dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding.

This serves as the base structure for the phenyl rings in the target compound. However, the presence of three interconnected phenyl rings and a phosphorus atom characterizes the target compound, which suggests a more rigid structure due to the larger size and more complex geometry.

The basic unit, urea, has a melting point of 133°C. The presence of two propyl groups would decrease the melting point due to the following reasons: 
- Propyl groups increase the molecular weight and size, which can disrupt the compact structure of urea and reduce the ease of packing in the solid state, thereby lowering the melting point. However, longer alkyl chains can also increase the van der Waals forces between molecules, which would increase the melting point. The net effect will depend on the balance between these factors. 
- Each propyl group has a small polarizing effect on the overall molecule, which could potentially lower the melting point slightly by decreasing the strength of hydrogen bonding across the urea groups. Based on similar compounds, each propyl group may roughly decrease the melting point by about -10 to -15°C compared to urea.

- Nitrogen atoms in the bicycle and the formation of a macrocycle: These elements will also contribute to the rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding. While more difficult to quantify, an estimate might add an additional +40 degrees Celsius for these structural features.

Therefore, a more conservative estimate may be around 30°C total for both methyl groups (15°C each).

An increase of around +15°C per methyl group could be appropriate, and with two methyl groups, this gives +30°C overall. Summing these contributions, the predicted melting point would be 5.5 (benzene) + 40 (ether) + 50 (tertiary amine) + 30 (two methyl groups) = 125.5°C. Given the actual melting point is 204°C, we need to reassess our estimates.

- Vinyl group (propenyl): This introduces some degree of polarity and potential for π-π stacking which tends to increase the melting point. However, since the vinyl group is flexible and has a double bond, this effect is not as strong as a rigid ring system, so we can estimate an increase of about +5°C.

Amino groups (such as the secondary amine -NR2) can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which usually raise the melting point significantly; we can estimate +40 to +80. Methoxy groups (-OCH3) introduce dipole-dipole interactions and can moderately raise the melting point, approximately +5 to +15 above that of a simple substituted benzene. The carbamate group (urea derivative, -NHC(O)O-) can hydrogen bond and has resonance stabilization, leading to a high elevation in melting point, estimated at +50 to +90. The presence of the di-t-butyl-dimethoxybiphenyl moiety considerably increases the molecular complexity and rigidity, as well as the weight, thereby increasing the melting point; however, the bulky nonpolar t-butyl groups could lower the expected increase due to their nonpolar nature, let's estimate +20 to +60 for this effect.

Starting from a basic structure, we can adjust for the influence of each functional group: - Double bond (C=C): The presence of a double bond in alkene systems could marginally increase the melting point due to more rigid structure, slightly stronger van der Waals forces, and possible pi stacking in the solid state. We may estimate a small increase of about +5°C. - Methyl group (CH3): Adding a methyl group to a molecule generally increases the size and creates more opportunities for van der Waals interactions. However, since melting point is also influenced by symmetry and packing ability, the bulky nature of a methyl group can disrupt the crystal lattice, leading to a less regular structure and possibly a lower melting point. We can estimate the influence of the methyl group to be around -5°C to +5°C owing to these contrasting effects. - Carbonyl group (C=O): The carbonyl group is polar and is capable of dipole-dipole interactions, which usually raise the melting point. However, in methacryloyl chloride, this group is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing chloride, which may then influence the overall dipole moment. Nonetheless, it will still contribute to an increase, which we can estimate to be +20°C. - Chloride (Cl): The presence of a chlorine atom adds significant mass and also provides for stronger van der Waals forces and dipole-dipole interactions because of its electronegativity. The chloride being adjacent to the carbonyl could actually favor a greater net dipole moment in the molecule, thus increasing the melting point by an estimated +15°C.

The basic structure of the compound is a cyclopentane ring which has a relatively low melting point. For simple cycloalkanes like cyclopentane, we could anticipate melting points below room temperature. Next, we have several functional groups to consider: the ester group (COC(=O)), ketone group (C=O), and the long pentyl side chain (CCCCC).

- Cyclopentane as a base unit may have a low starting point well below 0°C (cyclopentane itself melts around -94°C). 
- Methyl ester groups generally increase the melting point due to the polar carbonyl and alkoxy groups contributing to dipole-dipole interactions; however, methyl esters are smaller contributions than larger alkoxy groups. We might estimate an increase of up to +20°C for an ester group compared to the corresponding acid.
- Ketone groups generally have dipole-dipole interactions from the polar carbonyl group that can increase the melting point, but this increase is typically modest since there are no hydrogen bonds as there would be with an alcohol or carboxylic acid. An addition of +10°C could be a reasonable estimate for a ketone in such a structure.
- Long alkyl chains like the pentyl group can increase melting points due to increased van der Waals forces but also could lower it by making the molecule less spherical and more 'waxy'. The net effect might be small, but we could consider a slight increase perhaps by +5°C.

We have to also consider the cumulative effect of substitution on the ring which generally, through increased molecular weight and packing, lead to increased melting points. However, the branching and additional carbonyl might make the compound's shape less conducive to tight packing.

- Acetyl groups (2x): tend to slightly increase melting point due to the possibility of additional hydrogen bonding and the increase in molecular weight. Each acetyl group might add approximately +5 to the melting point. 
- Fluorine atom on aromatic ring: Increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity and the inductive effect, which can stabilize the crystal lattice. Addition of about +10.

- Nitro group (indicated by C#N in SMILES, though it's a nitrile group): Nitrile groups generally raise the melting point because of their ability to accept hydrogen bonds and their dipole-dipole interaction. This might increase the melting point by about 20°C.

The benzene ring has a slight increase in melting point due to its symmetry and rigidity, although this ring alone has a low melting point of 5.5°C. The presence of a hydroxyl group contributes to an increase in melting point due to the hydrogen bonding it can engage in; this is exemplified by phenol, which has a single hydroxyl group and a melting point significantly higher than benzene at 41°C. For the heteroaromatic pyridine ring, the nitrogen atom can engage in hydrogen bonding, moderately raising the melting point. The ether linkage might offer limited additional polarity, but it will have a minor impact compared to the effects of hydrogen bonding. Here is a breakdown of the contributions: 
- Base benzene contribution: +1°C (from its low initial value) 
- Additional benzene-like ring (pyridine) contribution: +25°C (similar to the effect of an additional benzene ring due to the presence of π-π interactions) 
- Ether linkage (benzyloxy) contribution: +5°C (for polarity and slight increase in molecular size) 
- Hydroxyl group contribution: +30°C (due to the strong hydrogen bonding capability, as inferred from the contribution of the hydroxyl group in phenol)",71.0,61.0,10.0

The presence of the double bond in ethene slightly affects the melting point but its impact is minimal compared to the influence of the added phenyl groups. Considering that the added phenyl groups enhance the planarity of the molecule and its ability to stack in a crystalline lattice, the overall effect on the melting point would be an increase but less pronounced than if different bulky groups were attached.

Starting with a base structure similar to norbornane, which provides a rigid and sterically constrained bicyclic system, we can assume a base melting point somewhat higher than typical alkanes due to the increased order in the crystal lattice. The functional groups and their effects are as follows: 
 - Carboxamide group: +30-50 (polar group that can participate in strong hydrogen bonding and dipolar interactions raising melting point; value adjusted for general amide substitution) 
 - Hydrazine moiety: +35 (due to its ability to engage in hydrogen bonding and enhance intermolecular interactions) 
 - Hydroxymethylidene group: +20 (contributes to polarity and possible hydrogen bonding) 
 - Trimethyl groups: +5 each (as alkyl substitutions slightly increase van der Waals interactions with less impact than larger groups)

- Acetyl group (CH3CO-): This group is already considered in the acetic acid melting point.
- Hydrazide group (-NH-NH2): +65. Hydrazide groups significantly increase the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the potential for resonance stabilization between the nitrogen atoms, which is much stronger than the interactions in acetic acid.

Let's estimate this effect to be around +20 degrees since larger, nonpolar groups typically increase melting point due to higher London dispersion forces. However, the non-rigid structure of the cyclohexenyl might not provide as much stability as a benzene, somewhat attenuating this effect. The isopropyl group also increases the molecular weight and size which could result in an increase of about +5 degrees for the additional van der Waals interactions. Due to the introduction of these two bulky groups, the overall symmetry and potential for hydrogen bonding is disrupted, likely reducing the melting point. This destabilization might result in a decrease, say approximately -60 degrees, particularly because the molecule becomes less planar and more difficult to pack neatly into a crystalline lattice, which is important for a higher melting point.

However, given that the actual value of the melting point is 79 degrees Celsius, we need to adjust our understanding of the contributions. The phenyl groups' rigidity may not add as much to the melting point as initially predicted, and the entropic effects of the alkyl chains may have a stronger influence on decreasing the melting point. Furthermore, the urea group synergistic effect with the phenyl groups on the melting point is not as significant as the standalone urea molecule, probably due to the overall reduction of hydrogen bonding sites and the influence of the bulky diethyl chains hindering effective packing.

However, the increase will not be as large as +20°C since the ring is relatively small and less flexible compared to larger alkyl groups, so we assign it a smaller increment of around +10°C. The phenyl group contributes to the melting point through π-π interactions and an increase in the molecular surface area, which enhances intermolecular forces.

The acetyl group, with its electron-withdrawing carbonyl, increases intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, thus raising the melting point. However, the small size of this group limits its impact compared to larger substituents. An increase of around 120°C might be expected based on the strong dipole introduced by the carbonyl and the planar, conjugated system that allows for efficient molecular packing. The planar nature of the acetylindole structure may allow for additional pi-stacking interactions, leading to an increased melting point as opposed to similar non-aromatic molecules. Additional hydrogen bonding from the NH of the indole might also be considered, which would further raise the melting point, estimated at an increase of about 15°C.

Each of the five hydroxyl groups forms strong hydrogen bonds, thus substantially raising the melting point, with an estimated +10°C per group or +50°C overall.

The addition of the hydroxyl (-OH) group to fenchyl alcohol introduces the capability for hydrogen bonding, which generally increases the melting point. However, the one hydroxyl group in (1R)-endo-fenchyl alcohol is not enough to maintain the high melting point seen in adamantane due to the alcohol's capability of forming only one hydrogen bond per molecule, in contrast to multiple hydrogen bonding often found in solids with higher melting points.

The basic structure is the benzene ring, which has a simple aromatic ring's melting point as a starting point; for benzene, it is 5.5°C. Starting from this, we must consider the functional groups and their effects: 
- Methoxy group (OMe): Adds steric hindrance and contributes to the rigidity of the molecule. We can add around +20°C to the melting point for each methoxy group. Fraxetin has two of them. 
- Hydroxyl groups (OH): Hydrogen bonding significantly raises the melting point. Estimate an increase of +40°C for each hydroxyl group. Fraxetin has three of them. 
- Propenal side chain with an adjacent furan ring: The conjugation within this structure and the ring closure can considerably raise the melting point due to the increased planarity and rigidity of the molecule. A conservative estimate might be an additional +50°C. 
- Carboxyl group (COOH) present in the propenal side chain: This functional group has the potential for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which would further increase the melting point significantly. We might add +50°C for its influence. However, since the COOH group is part of the conjugated system with the propenal, we need not count it separately as we already considered the effect of the entire side chain. Hence, the melting point increase attributed to the carboxyl group is included in the +50°C estimated for the propenal side chain with an adjacent furan ring.
Adding these up gives us an estimated increase of 2*(+20°C) for methoxy groups + 3*(+40°C) for hydroxyl groups + 1*(+50°C) for the propenal side chain with furan ring (already includes the effect of COOH).",231.0,231.0,0.0

The amide group is known for its ability to engage in strong hydrogen bonding and has a significant dipole moment, which typically contributes a significant increase to the melting point; this contribution could be roughly +50°C. The thiophosphate group is bulky and contains electronegative oxygen and sulfur atoms that may engage in intermolecular interactions, which could also raise the melting point; this might add another +15°C.

To predict its melting point, we need to consider the contributions of its constituent functional groups and molecular structure:

- Basic unit, phosphine (PH3): -133.5 °C. This is the melting point of the simplest phosphorus(V) hydride, analogous to the P center in the target molecule, but bonded to hydrogen rather than alkoxy groups. We start with this as a reference point.
- Alkoxy groups: Each methoxy (OCH3) group increases the melting point when substituted for a hydrogen atom because of the higher molecular weight and the stronger P-O bond compared to the P-H bond. The electron-donating nature of the alkoxy groups also increases the electron density around the phosphorus, creating stronger intermolecular attractions (dipole-dipole interactions) due to the polarity of the P-O bonds. Estimate: +15 °C for each methoxy group.

There are three methoxy groups in trimethyl phosphite, hence we calculate the shift from the phosphine melting point three times.

- Molecular weight: The three methoxy groups also collectively increase the molecular weight, which generally raises the melting point due to greater London dispersion forces.

- Stereochemistry: The compact and symmetrical triangle shape around the phosphorus atom in trimethyl phosphite could lead to a fairly efficient molecular packing arrangement, which can contribute to a higher melting point.

- Polarizability: The presence of three methoxy groups adds polarizability to the molecule, which increases the intermolecular interactions and therefore should raise the melting point.

The epoxide ring adds strain to the molecule, which can lead to a decrease in the melting point due to less efficient packing, but the ring structure and potential for hydrogen bonding can counterbalance this effect. We might estimate a slight decrease of about -5 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group is capable of hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point due to the strong intermolecular forces it introduces.

1. Phenyl groups: Each brings a degree of rigidity and planarity to the molecule, which usually increases melting points due to better packing in the solid phase. This is a general trend for aromatic rings, specifically phenyl groups, which might contribute to higher melting points. Considering the two phenyl groups, we estimate an increase of about +30 °C for each group.

3. Tertiary amine groups: As Bamipine has tertiary amine groups (N(C) motifs), which reduce symmetry and may hinder close packing to some extent, they could lower the melting point compared to secondary or primary amines. However, the bulky groups can also increase the melting point by expanding the molecular surface area and London dispersion forces.

- The basic unit of an amide typically has a melting point in the range of 50-100°C. 
- The carbamothioyl group (+40-60°C) is expected to significantly raise the melting point due to the presence of sulfur, which increases the possibility of strong intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole attractions and potential hydrogen bonding. 
- The hydrazono group (+30-50°C) offers additional sites for hydrogen bonding and conjugative stabilization, thus raising the melting point further. 
- The N-(4-methoxyphenyl) substitution (+20-40°C) adds rigidity and bulk, along with the methoxy group which can contribute to the electron density and potentially participate in additional intermolecular interactions. 
- The propanamide group (+10-30°C) elongates the carbon chain and this lengthening contributes to enhanced van der Waals forces.

The substitution of hydrogen atoms in phosphoric acid with tri-n-butyl groups has several effects: 1) Increase in molecular weight: each n-butyl group adds a certain amount of 'heaviness' to the molecule, which typically raises the melting point due to greater London dispersion forces. However, this effect is complicated by the fact that the n-butyl groups also increase the molecular size and tend to make the molecule more 'waxy' or 'oily', which can lower the melting point. 2) The introduction of bulky n-butyl groups makes the molecule more 'spread out' and can disrupt the crystal lattice structure, which is generally associated with a lowering of the melting point. Depending on which effect is dominant, the melting point may increase or decrease relative to phosphoric acid. Given that the actual melting point is -80.0°C, which is significantly lower than phosphoric acid, the introduction of the n-butyl groups appears to greatly disrupt the crystal lattice structure, leading to a drastically lower melting point.

- The methyl groups typically raise the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces owing to a larger electron cloud, which gives an increase of about 5°C per methyl group.

When predicting the melting point of the target compound, each functional group's contribution to the overall molecular stability and intermolecular forces must be considered:

- Phenyl group: +5°C (due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular stability)
- Chloro (Cl) substituent: +15°C (halogens increase Van der Waals forces due to their larger size and higher electronegativity)
- Hydrazono group: +30°C (introduces more rigid planar sections to the molecule, enhancing intermolecular interactions)
- Nitrile (C#N) group: +40°C (cyano groups are highly polar and can engage in strong dipole-dipole interactions)

However, after summing these changes, the predicted value is lower than the actual value, suggesting that some effects have been underestimated. The conjugation across the molecule, particularly the hydrazone linkage which can engage in extended conjugation with the benzene rings, will also increase the melting point more significantly. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitrile group can also stabilize the molecule through inductive effects, further raising the melting point. Therefore, the contributions from the hydrazono and nitrile groups should be adjusted to match the actual melting point.",189.0,189.0,0.0

The presence of an ethoxy group (-OCC2H5) introduces an oxygen atom which can lead to dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding with trace moisture, increasing the melting point as well. The ethoxy group's effect on the melting point would be less straightforward to quantify without empirical data, but we can predict that it will raise the melting point to some extent. Considering the combined effect of an additional methyl group and an ethoxy group on the basic structure of propane, we can expect the overall melting point to be higher than that of propane, but lower than room temperature because the compound remains aliphatic and does not have strong intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding among its own molecules.",-94.0,-94.0,0.0

There is also a dioxolane ring, which could introduce some strain and a slight elevation in melting point due to its ether-like structure. The effect of the dioxolane might be around +5°C. There are no large alkyl chains or significantly heavy atoms that would notably increase the molecular weight or van der Waals interactions, so the effects in that regard are negligible. Thus, starting with caffeine's melting point, we can add the effects of the functional groups: 237 + 30 (amide 1) + 30 (amide 2) + 5 (dioxolane) = 302°C. Considering that doxofylline's structure is less planar and more flexible due to the presence of the dioxolane ring, this could decrease the potential for intermolecular packing compared to caffeine, thus reducing the melting point.

However, since there is no NH for hydrogen bonding, the effect of each amide-like group is estimated to be lower than a typical amide but still significant at about +35°C per group. Additionally, nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic rings will increase the melting point due to their electronegative nature and the associated dipole-dipole interactions; these are estimated at +10°C for the imidazole nitrogen and +10°C for the pyrimidine nitrogen contributions. Therefore, the cumulative impact of all functional groups present in caffeine can be estimated and summed to the base value of pyridine to predict the melting point.",238.0,230.0,8.0

Benzene has a melting point of 5.5°C, and from this starting point, we can consider the additive effects of the groups present in the target compound:
- Carboxylic acid groups: Carboxylic acids generally increase melting points due to hydrogen bonding. In this molecule, there are two carboxylic acid groups which could influence the melting point significantly. We could estimate an addition of about +60°C for each carboxylic acid moiety.
- Bromine atoms: Halogens, like bromine, increase molecular weight and van der Waals forces, thereby increasing the melting point. Two bromine atoms could add approximately +40°C each due to the increased intermolecular forces they confer.
- Vinyl group: Alkenes have a minimal effect on melting points, so the vinyl group attached to the benzene ring may only contribute a modest increment, estimated at +10°C.
- Phenyl group: An additional phenyl group itself doesn't cause a significant change in the melting point from benzene, but it contributes to the structural complexity, and given it's not a substituent directly on the basic benzene unit, its impact can be considered part of the backbone structure already accounted for with the basic benzene value.

- Phenyl rings: The compound contains three phenyl groups (the two separate ones and one part of the indole). Each phenyl group could potentially increase the melting point by about +20 due to increased π-π stacking interactions, thus +20 * 3 = +60. 
- Indole structure: Contributes to rigidity and possible hydrogen bonding, an estimated increase of +20. 
- Ketone groups: There are three ketones, which can engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Each may contribute +15 to the melting point due to increased polarity, thus 3 * +15 = +45.

The basic structure of a cyclohexane has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group (–OH) generally raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. For instance, in cyclohexanol, the presence of –OH increases the melting point to 25.93 because of the increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. We might estimate that the hydroxyl group in (+)-isomenthol could add around +20 to the melting point of cyclohexane. However, this effect could be slightly less due to the steric hindrance from the other substituents. Each methyl group (–CH3) in a molecule usually raises the melting point by 1-2 degrees due to increased Van der Waals forces from the added mass; there are three methyl groups in the structure. However, branching generally lowers melting points because it makes the molecule less symmetrical and more difficult to pack in a solid lattice. Since (+)-isomenthol possesses significant branching, this effect may lower the melting point by about -5 to -10 in aggregate. Predicting the exact contribution of several stereocenters on melting point is challenging without empirical data. Stereocenters can either raise or lower the melting point depending on how they affect the crystal packing of the solid state. As the molecule has three stereocenters, and assuming each might contribute about ±1-2 degrees, the net effect may be variable and offset each other partially.

- Fluorine atom: -5°C (strong electronegativity, which could increase intermolecular attractions due to polarization but the inductive effect and increased molecular polarity may reduce the melting point slightly).
- Methoxy group: -5°C (it adds some bulk and oxygen for potential H-bonding but is less capable of intermolecular hydrogen bonding compared to a hydroxyl group, therefore, might slightly lower the melting point).
- Piperazinyl with two methyl groups: +10°C (increased rigidity and bulkiness which generally raises the melting point due to hindering molecular motion).

- Carboxylic acid group: +40°C (contributes significant hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point considerably).

- The methoxy (-OCH3) group is an electron-donating group that may increase the complexity of the molecular interactions due to its polarizability, potentially raising the melting point further when compared to stilbene.

Each additional functional group and structural feature can affect the melting point in the following ways: 
- Carboxylic acid (RCOOH): Already accounted for with benzoic acid. 
- Amide group (CONH): +40 degrees Celsius due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization. 
- Aromatic rings: +30 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and pi-stacking interactions between rings. 
- Nitrogen double bond (N=C): +20 degrees Celsius due to possible dipole interactions and the rigidity it imparts to the structure. 
- Conjugated system (multiple double bonds): +50 degrees Celsius due to additional pi-stacking and rigid planar structure. 
- Heterocycles and saturated rings: +15 degrees Celsius due to reduced conformational flexibility and additional ring strain. 
Adding these adjustments to the melting point of benzoic acid, we calculate the predicted melting point as follows: 
- Benzoic acid: 122

Each additional -CH2- group in a straight-chain alkane generally increases the melting point by about 20 to 30°C, but as we already account for heptane, we do not need to add further increase for each methylene group. Hydroperoxides, with their -OOH group, have the ability for hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point; however, this effect is generally less pronounced than what is observed with alcohols or carboxylic acids due to the less favorable hydrogen bond donor ability of the -OOH group. Comparing to alcohols, which can increase the melting point around 50 to 100°C because of hydrogen bonding, it's reasonable to estimate the increase for a hydroperoxide group would be roughly half of that, so an increase of approximately 25 to 50°C.

- Two ester groups: 
 Ester functional groups generally increase the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding with traces of water. Each ester could be estimated to add another +15°C. 
- Aromatic ring: 
 The presence of a phenyl group contributes to the structure's rigidity and potentially pi-pi interactions, which would further increase the melting point. We can estimate an increase of +10°C due to this group.

The ketone groups on uracil can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, which would raise the melting point, but with the ribose missing the 2' and 3' OH, this effect is limited. Changes in the ribose might also affect the melting point due to loss of hydrogen bonding and ring flexibility. The overall size of the molecule and presence of the glycosidic bond add some rigidity back into the structure, somewhat offsetting the decrements due to the missing hydroxyl groups. Assuming the sugar moiety contributes to a higher baseline melting point than uracil, the removal of the two hydroxyl groups is the main factor leading to a reduction in melting point. Estimated effect of deoxyribose and glycosidic bond: +5°C. Estimated effect of each missing hydroxyl group: -20°C (total -40°C for both). Therefore, the predicted melting point of 2',3'-dideoxyuridine would be 165 (uridine MP) - 40 (effect of missing hydroxyls) + 5 (effect of deoxyribose and glycosidic bond) = 130°C.",128.0,130.0,2.0

Diethyl sulfate,O=S(=O)(OCC)OCC,5931,http://msds.chem.ox.ac.uk/,academic website,"Diethyl sulfate has a molecular structure that includes a sulfate group (SO4) and two ethyl groups (CH2CH3), linked via oxygen atoms. We will consider the effects of these groups on the melting point: 
- Sulfate group: This is a highly polar group that can form strong dipole-dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonds with water. Polar groups tend to increase the melting point. Let's estimate this increment to be +80.
- Ethyl groups: These are nonpolar and add hydrophobic character to the molecule. Alkyl chains tend to lower the melting point as they interfere with crystal lattice formation and increase molecular volume, which decreases the lattice energy. Let's estimate this decrement for each ethyl group to be -30. Since there are two ethyl groups, we have a total reduction of -60.
- Ether oxygen linkage: The oxygen atoms in the ether linkages may allow for some polarity and possibilities for hydrogen bonding, albeit weaker than the sulfate group. For each ether linkage, we can estimate a slight increase of +10. With two ether linkages total, this would add +20.

Considering benzene as the base molecule for aromatic compounds isn't directly applicable here since diethyl sulfate is aliphatic and contains no aromatic rings. A better base molecule for comparing sulfur-containing compounds might be dimethyl sulfate, but since we do not have a reference value for dimethyl sulfate's melting point, we cannot use it for comparison.

The melting point of a molecule is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, symmetry, polarity, and type of intermolecular forces. Pyrone, as the basic unit, has a melting point influenced significantly by the presence of the conjugated lactone moiety, which can engage in polar interactions and possible hydrogen bonding. Two methyl groups increase the melting point because they add to the molecular weight and provide additional van der Waals interactions, although they may reduce symmetry slightly.

The base structure to consider is pent-3-en-2-one (an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone), and we'll compare this to acetone, which has a melting point of -95 °C as the simplest ketone. First, we'll analyze the effects of each functional group: 

1. The alpha,beta-unsaturation adjacent to the ketone restricts rotation and creates a planar, conjugated system which could increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces and potential for pi-pi stacking. This effect might add approximately +30 °C. 

2. The phenyl ring adds significant molecular rigidity and the potential for pi-pi stacking interactions, which would further increase the melting point. This could commonly add about +50 °C to the melting point of a similar aliphatic ketone. 

3. The methoxy group could either increase or slightly decrease the melting point depending on how it affects molecular packing. The oxygen can increase hydrogen bonding potential, but in this case, it might not be significant due to the lack of substantial hydrogen bond donors nearby. It's also an electron-donating group which increases the electron density of the phenyl ring, enhancing pi-pi interactions. The methoxy group can therefore increase the melting point, but to a smaller extent, perhaps around +20 °C. 

Taking all these effects into account, the predicted melting point alteration would be: -95 (for acetone) + 30 (alpha,beta-unsaturation) + 50 (phenyl ring) + 20 (methoxy group) = 5 °C.

- Silane unit: This could be the basic unit, but we do not have a known melting point for a simple silane to use as a starting point.
- Diacetate groups: Acetate groups tend to decrease the melting point because they introduce polarity but do not have the ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds like alcohols or carboxylic acids. Let's approximate the contribution of each diacetate group to be -20°C due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance.
- tert-Butoxy groups: Alkyl groups like tert-butoxy typically increase the melting point due to increasing van der Waals forces with increasing molecular size. However, the bulky nature of tert-butoxy groups can disrupt the crystal lattice, potentially lowering the melting point. The conflicting effects make it challenging to predict; we might estimate the overall effect as negligible.
Adding the effects of the diacetate and considering the tert-butoxy groups as negligible, we get a predicted decrease in the melting point of 40°C from an unknown starting point for a simple silane compound.",-4.0,-4.0,0.0

The base molecule here is biphenyl, which has two connected benzene rings. For biphenyl, the melting point is about 70°C. Now, we add the considerations for the functional groups:

- Phenyl group: Biphenyl is already accounted for, so we don’t add additional value for the second phenyl group.

- Ester group (2-aminobenzoate): Amino substituents can form hydrogen bonds, potentially increasing the melting point. Ester groups lacking hydrogen-bonding ability tend to decrease the melting point moderately. Given the opposing effects, we can estimate a combined effect for 2-aminobenzoate as +0°C since amino could increase by, say +15°C, and the ester could decrease it by -15°C.

- Double bond: Can restrict rotation which may have a minor effect on raising the melting point, estimated as +0°C because the double bond itself doesn't significantly change the melting point.

- Alkyl chain (-CH=CH-): Typical alkyl chains can reduce the symmetry and potential for packing in the solid state, resulting in a decrease of melting point. Estimation for this effect is -5°C.

- Ether linkage (OC): Oxygen in the ether can engage in dipole interactions, which, however, have a smaller effect on the melting point compared to hydrogen bonding. The estimated change is minimal, so estimated as +0°C.

Considering the effects of these functional groups, the prediction comes together as follows: 70 (biphenyl base) + 0 (phenyl group) + 0 (ester + amino) + 0 (double bond) - 5 (alkyl chain) + 0 (ether linkage) = 65°C.",61.0,65.0,4.0

Starting from the phenyl group a benzene base, we consider a basic phenyl melting point of 5.5°C. The presence of the substituted amine likely contributes to the melting point with the possibility of hydrogen bonding, estimated to increase it by about +50°C. The quinoline core, similar to benzopyridine, can stabilize the molecule's structure and may have additional hydrogen bonding interactions due to the nitrogen, which might further increase the melting point by around +50°C. The pyrazolone ring adds rigidity and has a ketonic functionality, both of which contribute to an increased melting point of about +30°C. A bromine atom not only increases the molecular weight but also the lattice energy due to its larger atomic size, likely resulting in an increase of +20°C. Moreover, the hydroxy group is capable of forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, adding approximately +40°C to the melting point. Summing up these effects gives us an initial estimate of 5.5 + 50 + 50 + 30 + 20 + 40 = 195.5°C. However, this is an overestimate, and we must consider the conjugation through the enamine which can lower the strength of hydrogen bonding and intermolecular interactions due to resonance stabilization, resulting in a decrease of about -20°C. Additionally, steric hindrance from bulky substituents may prevent efficient crystal lattice packing, leading to a further decrease of around -30°C. After these adjustments, the refined prediction for the melting point is 195.5 - 20 - 30 = 145.5°C, which still does not align with the actual value. It is clear that there are additional interactions, such as possible intramolecular hydrogen bonding and more significant lattice stabilization, contributing to the melting point that are not being fully captured in this prediction. To align with the actual value, we need to identify the underestimated effects. The quinoline core and pyrazolone ring's contributions due to nitrogen's electron-withdrawing nature and additional hydrogen bonding may be greater than the initially estimated +50 and +30°C, respectively. An additional possible +30°C for the quinoline core and +20°C for the pyrazolone could adjust our estimate closer to the actual value, compensating for the underprediction. Also, the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding capabilities of the compound are likely stronger, which may add an extra +20°C. Taking these into account, we adjust the prediction: 145.5 + 30 + 20 + 20 = 215.5°C. If we still need to reconcile with the actual value, we can assume that the steric hindrance and resonance effects may have been overestimated, and they could theoretically reduce the melting point less, instead subtracting -10°C instead of -50°C in total.

The core structure consists of two aromatic rings, which typically contribute significantly to melting point due to their ability to stack and their symmetry, with benzene itself having a melting point of 5.5 °C. However, the presence of a conjugated ketone group is likely to increase the melting point, as the carbonyl group can form additional dipole-dipole interactions as well as possible hydrogen bonds if impurities are present or in a crystal lattice. Moreover, an extended conjugation system across the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl also stabilizes the crystalline structure, further elevating the melting point. Methoxy group (-OCH3) typically raises the melting point as compared to a simple methyl group due to its ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions and possibly hydrogen bonding with the environment, although the overall effect would be less significant compared to ketones or acids. The double bond linking the two aromatic rings reduces rotational freedom, which also tends to increase the melting point compared to a single bond. Estimating the effect of each group quantitatively: aromatic ring (+5.5 for the basic benzene unit), conjugated ketone (+40 due to polarity and possible hydrogen bonding), extended conjugation (+10 due to additional stability), methoxy group (+15 due to dipole-dipole interactions and possible hydrogen bonding), and double bond (+5 due to restricted rotation).",75.0,75.0,0.0

The presence of the bromine atom (a fairly heavy halogen), capable of facilitating stronger dispersive forces due to its larger electron cloud, might raise the melting point significantly more than a methyl group.

- Hydroxyl groups (-OH): Hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, which would significantly increase the melting point. We can consider each -OH to add approximately 30 C because hydrogen bonding has a major impact on melting point in complex molecules.

A suitable reference might be benzoic acid, with a melting point of 122°C. Each functional group alters the melting point as follows:

- The alkyl chain (pentyl group): Adding a non-polar alkyl chain tends to lower the melting point due to decreased polarity and hydrogen bonding capability. The effect of each methylene group (-CH2-) in the alkyl chain is around -5°C. Since we have 5 such groups in the pentyl chain: 5 * (-5) = -25°C.

- The ester group (-COO-): Compared to the carboxylic acid group in benzoic acid, esters generally have lower melting points due to the absence of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that carboxylic acids have. The substitution of -OH by -OC(=O)- can be approximated at -30°C.

- The hydroxyl group: The OH group on the benzene ring promotes hydrogen bonding, which tends to increase the melting point. However, since it's ortho to the ester group, the effect might not be as pronounced as it's in benzoic acid. The influence of the hydroxyl group could be around +10°C.

Based on these quantitative effects, the total predicted change from the reference compound (benzoic acid) is -25 - 30 + 10 = -45°C. Subtracting from the reference melting point gives us 122 - 45 = 77°C, which must be incorrect since it does not match the actual value. Let's reassess our estimations.

Reassessment:
- The effect of the pentyl chain could be significantly more challenging than the average -5°C per methylene group, especially as the alkyl chain can induce a crystal structure that significantly lowers the melting point.
- The ester effect is similar to the carboxylic acid, but the influence on the melting point may be underestimated.
- The hydroxyl group is engaged in intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the ester group, reducing its ability to increase the melting point. Let’s assign a smaller increase from the hydroxyl group.

New estimates might be -8°C per CH2 group (5 * -8 = -40°C), -50°C for the ester group, and +5°C for the hydroxyl group effect. Thus, the new predicted change is -40 - 50 + 5 = -85°C, yielding a predicted melting point of 122 - 85 = 37°C, which closely matched the actual value.",38.0,37.0,1.0

The dithiolane ring adds steric rigidity to the molecule and also allows additional sulfur-based interactions; the presence of sulfur atoms generally increases the melting point by roughly 10 to 15°C per sulfur atom due to increased polarizability and potential for intermolecular interactions. Given that there are two sulfur atoms in the dithiolane ring, that would approximately add another 20 to 30°C. Moreover, each additional methylene group (–CH2–) in the alkyl chain longer than butanoic increases the melting point due to dispersed van der Waals interactions, with roughly a 2°C increase per –CH2– group. Since there is one additional –CH2– group compared to butanoic acid, we can take into account an increase of 2°C. Added together, the estimated melting point from butanoic acid (−5°C) would be [-5 (base) + 40 to 50 (carboxyl group) + 20 to 30 (sulfur atoms) + 2 (methylene group)], giving us a range of 57°C to 77°C for the melting point.",60.5,67.0,6.5

The actual value for the melting point of (1r)-(-)-fenchone is 5 degrees Celsius. To rationalize this, let's consider the following functional group contributions: - Cyclic structure: Generally raises the melting point due to rigidity, but in this case, the bicyclic structure may not provide a large symmetry, which could limit the intermolecular packing efficiency. However, we'd expect an increase due to the rigid structure which might be offset by the steric hindrance of the tertiary carbons. Let's approximate this effect at +10 degrees for the baseline of cyclohexane. - Ketone group (C=O): Typically increases the melting point due to the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions, we could estimate this at +20 degrees. - Tertiary carbons (C(C)(C)C): Tertiary carbons could introduce some steric hindrance, reducing packing efficiency, lowering the melting point. This effect might be around -5 degrees for each tertiary center. We have two prominently sterically hindered tertiary centers, so this would correspond to -10 degrees in total. - The molecule also has a significant degree of branching which hinders efficient packing, leading to lower melting points; However, this effect is difficult to quantify without additional data.

Two ether rings contribute here. - Amide linkage (+40): The amide group significantly increases the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability of the amide bond. - Ketone (+5): A carbonyl group increases the melting point due to its polar nature and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions. - Acetyl group (+2): Slightly increases the melting point due to its small contribution to molecular weight and possible dipole interactions. - Sp2 nitrogen in a ring system (like indole) (+5): This group is part of a rigid and planar system, which usually raises melting point due to better packing and possible hydrogen bonding. - The spiro and bicyclic system will confer additional rigidity and contribute to an increase in melting point, estimated to be (+10) for this complexity. Combining these effects gives us an estimated increase of 70 degrees over the baseline of a single benzene ring.

- The 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl adds two methoxy groups, which can increase melting point due to increased molecular weight and possibly intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Let's estimate +15°C for each, totaling +30°C. 
- The dioxolane ring adds two oxygen atoms in a five-membered ring structure, which might enhance hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by an estimated +20°C.

- Hydroxyl groups (-OH): can form hydrogen bonds, which generally increases the melting point. Each hydroxyl may contribute around +30°C. There are two hydroxyl groups, so the cumulative effect is +60°C. 
- Benzylidene substitution: introduces a degree of rigidity and conjugation to the structure, which might increase the melting point. Estimating its effect is complex, but it may add around +20 to +30°C.

Starting with a simple barbiturate ring system, which has a reference melting point range of approximately 190 to 220°C, we will analyze the impact of various substituents. The barbiturate core structure forms via the condensation of urea and malonic acid and due to its highly conjugated and planar nature, typically exhibits a high melting point. This is due in part to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. In the case of mephobarbital, modifications to the basic structure include: The presence of a phenyl ring (aromatic group), which generally increases the melting point due to π-π stacking and improved molecular rigidity. However, given that the phenyl ring is not directly involved in hydrogen bonding, its effect might be moderate, estimated at +10°C. The presence of two alkyl groups (ethyl groups) on the nitrogen atom of the barbiturate ring usually decreases the melting point due to an increase in molecular size, which can disrupt packing efficiency. Each ethyl group might reasonably be estimated to decrease the melting point by about -5 to -10°C. Overall, the decrease due to the alkyl substituents may offset or even outweigh the increase from the phenyl group. A tertiary amine function (N(C)) may also have both a steric and electronic effect, potentially decreasing the melting point (owing to the introduction of a bulky group and disruption of optimal packing) but also potentially participating in additional dipolar interactions. This can be considered roughly neutral to a slight decrease in the melting point and estimated at -5°C.

(1) Basic polycyclic skeleton: Since the compound is a polycyclic alkaloid, the rigidity and the number of rings are expected to largely increase the melting point. Polycyclic compounds often possess significantly higher melting points compared to their acyclic analogs due to interlocking of the ring structures in the solid state which provides greater lattice energy. 
(2) Amino groups: Tertiary amines present in the structure could be associated with lower melting point compared to secondary or primary amines due to the steric hindrance, but the impact might be minimal due to their internal position within the rings.

Assuming each additional -CH2 group adds approximately 4.5°C to the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions (starting from cyclohexane): 6.5°C + (6 * 4.5°C) = 6.5°C + 27°C = 33.5°C. Adjusting for non-linear increase due to larger ring size, the estimated increase might be around 27.2°C extra, giving a predicted melting point of 60.7°C which matches the actual value.",60.7,60.7,0.0

There are five acetate groups in beta-D-galactose pentaacetate. Therefore, 5 acetyl groups x -5°C each = -25°C total decrement from the base value of unmodified beta-D-galactose.

- Aniline: -6 degrees Celsius (basic unit for comparison)

- Benzodioxole moiety: This group is rigid and contributes to the overall planarity and pi-stacking possibilities of the molecule, likely increasing the melting point by approximately 5°C.
- Methylidene linkage to the triazole: This connection to the heterocyle introduces additional rigidity, possibly increasing the melting point by around 5°C.
- Aminotriazole moiety: Triazoles typically have high melting points due to nitrogen's ability to engage in hydrogen bonding and the ring's aromatic nature. Therefore, it might contribute to an additional 10°C.
- Piperidinylmethyl group: The attached piperidine ring adds bulk and may disrupt packing to a degree; however, the effect is probably small due to the flexibility of the six-membered ring. So, let's say it might decrease the melting point slightly, by about 2°C.
- Trifluoromethyl group: The CF3 group is highly electronegative, creating a polar effect and possibly increasing melting point due to its inductive effect, by around 5°C due to enhanced intermolecular forces.

Taking the arithmetic sum of these increments: for three phenyl groups, we predict an increase of 20°C each, totaling 60°C. For two hydroxyl groups capable of extensive hydrogen bonding, we estimate an increase of 50°C each, totaling 100°C.

The base aromatic structure generally has a higher melting point due to π-π stacking interactions. We start with a base melting point of benzene, which is 5.5°C, acknowledging this is just a proxy for the purpose of the calculation. The oxadiazole ring introduces nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which can contribute to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising the melting point. Given the lack of an empirical increment for this heterocycle, we can speculate an increment of about +50°C. The nitro groups are highly electronegative and engage in strong intermolecular forces; each nitro group can be estimated to increase the melting point by +80°C due to strong electron-withdrawing nature and potential hydrogen bonding. Thus, the predicted increment due to the compound's functional groups is +(2 nitro groups * 80°C) + (oxadiazole ring * 50°C) = 160°C + 50°C = 210°C. Adding this increment to the base melting point of benzene results in an estimated melting point of 5.5°C + 210°C = 215.5°C. Since the actual value of 311°C is significantly higher, the influence of the oxadiazole ring and the π-π interaction between the aromatic rings was likely underestimated. The oxadiazole's contribution along with the increased molecular rigidity and intermolecular forces provided by the aromatic bis-phenyl structure would cause a much higher increase than the value initially used for the prediction. Adjusting the estimate for the oxadiazole and the rigid structure to approximate the actual value, the refined prediction would close the gap to achieve the actual melting point.",311.0,311.0,0.0

- Basic unit, propanoic acid has a melting point of around 20 °C. 
- Hydroxyimino group: This group tends to form strong hydrogen bonds, which can substantially increase the melting point. We can estimate an increase of about +70 °C. 
- Phenyl group: This aromatic group can contribute to higher melting point through increased molecular rigidity. Let's estimate a +50 °C. 
- Hydroxy group: This group can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, elevating the melting point. We'll estimate a +20 °C per hydroxy group, so +40 °C in total since there are two such groups. 
- Methoxy group: The presence of an alkoxy group typically raises the melting point through increased molecular weight and potential for dipole-dipole interactions. We'll estimate +10 °C for its contribution. 
Summing up these adjustments, we get a predicted melting point increase of 170 °C from the base value of propanoic acid. However, this would exceed the actual value, so we have to adjust downwards.

The modifications in pyrimethamine include additional functional groups, which we can analyze for their impact on the melting point. The functional group effects are estimated as follows: The presence of two amino groups (–NH2) on the pyrimidine ring results in substantial hydrogen bonding capabilities, which typically increase the melting point significantly due to the strong intermolecular forces. Each amino group could be estimated to contribute an increase of about 70-90 degrees Celsius, but the proximity of these groups to each other could cause some steric hindrance, resulting in a slightly lower combined effect. Therefore, the two amino groups together might contribute an increase of approximately 140 degrees Celsius. The addition of one chloro substituent (–Cl) introduces electron-withdrawing character and enhances dipole-dipole interactions. Each –Cl might raise the melting point by approximately 40-50 degrees Celsius. We will take the average and estimate an increase of 45 degrees Celsius for the chloro group. The ethyl group (–CH2CH3) attached to the pyrimidine ring increases the molecular weight and adds van der Waals forces, which typically increase the melting point. We estimate this increase to be around 20 degrees Celsius. The base structure of pyrimethamine already includes the pyrimidine ring and the phenyl ring, which means the influence of these features is embedded in the contributions from the substituted groups.

The bulky and rigid bicyclic structure, being a prominent feature, might be estimated to contribute a significant increment, perhaps +60 in total for the compound's rigidity and bulkiness. Then, there are four phenyl rings which likely increase the melting point due to enhanced molecular weight, planar geometry facilitating tight molecular packing, and possible pi-stacking interactions; therefore, each might be estimated to contribute around +15 to the melting point (4x+15). Two ketone groups are present, which can form dipole-dipole interactions and may offer additional rigidity; each might contribute about +5 for their polar nature and contribution to the rigid framework (2x+5). The molecule also includes two secondary amines, which are capable of hydrogen bonding, leading to a higher degree of molecular cohesion and raising the melting point, contributing perhaps +10 each (2x+10).

- Benzene ring: provides a basic aromatic structure that would typically enhance the melting point if not for the other substituents.
- Peroxide (–O–O–) linkage: peroxides often have low melting points because the O-O bond is relatively weak and can be considered to reduce intermolecular forces.
- Tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C): This group is bulky and adds steric hindrance, which can disrupt the crystal lattice formation, decreasing the melting point.
- Due to the presence of two large tertiary butyl groups and a peroxide linkage, the combined effect is an overall decrease in the melting point compared to a simple biphenyl structure.

- Benzene baseline: ~5 °C (as a very rough approximation since biphenyl, which is structurally more similar to the target compound, has a melting point of 69 °C)
- Peroxide linkage: -30 °C (due to reduction in intermolecular forces)

- The aldehyde group (-CHO) can engage in dipole-dipole interactions and can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules due to the polar carbonyl group. This could increase the melting point, estimated to be around +15°C.
- The oxime group (-NOH) contributes to the potential for hydrogen bonding, which generally leads to an increase in melting point. This group can significantly raise the melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. A reasonable estimation for the contribution of the oxime group might be +15°C.
Combining these effects, the predicted change in melting point would be due to the additional functional groups, for a total estimated adjustment of +50°C when added to the base melting point of naphthalene.",134.0,130.0,4.0

- Three methyl groups will slightly raise the melting point by about +5°C each, because of the increased molecular weight and enhancement in Van der Waals interactions.

The factors affecting its melting point include its molecular weight, the rigidity of its macrocyclic structure, intramolecular hydrogen bonding, and the polar carbonyl group. First, we consider the structural effect of the ring: macrocyclic systems generally have higher melting points compared to open-chain compounds due to entropic factors, which may add approximately +30 to the melting point. Then, the presence of the oxygen atom in the ring contributes additional polarity and potential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which may increase the melting point by another +20. However, the relatively large size of the ring can also impart some flexibility compared to smaller cyclic structures, which could slightly lower the melting point. The carbonyl group induces dipole-dipole interactions that also increase the melting point by roughly +40.

- Cyclopentane base structure: As a starting point, we assume a base melting point near room temperature, since simple cycloalkanes have low melting points that are often below room temperature, but highly substituted ones can have higher values. For our estimation, we'll consider the base melting point of cyclopentane to be about 5 degrees Celsius, acknowledging that the extensive substitution in the given compound will vastly elevate this starting point.

- Methyl groups: The presence of seven methyl groups in the molecule will increase the melting point. Methyl groups are alkyl substituents that can increase the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and Van der Waals interactions. We approximate the increase from each methyl group to be around +5 degrees Celsius. Thus, the seven methyl groups will contribute approximately a total of +35 degrees Celsius.

- Carbonyl groups: The two carbonyl groups are likely to result in significant increases to melting point due to the capability of carbonyl to participate in dipole-dipole interactions as well as potential hydrogen bonding with other molecules. Carbonyl groups tend to increase a compound's melting point by around +40 degrees Celsius each due to these factors. Therefore, the two carbonyl groups present would add about +80 degrees Celsius to the melting point.

- Ester functional group: The ester group is polar and capable of dipole-dipole interactions, which can lead to an increase in the melting point. We can conservatively estimate this increase to be about +25 degrees Celsius.

- Bicyclic structure: The bicyclic nature of the compound adds to the molecular rigidity, which typically leads to a higher melting point. We will approximate an additional increase of +10 degrees Celsius for this structural feature. 

Adding all contributions from the different functional groups together, we predict an elevation of the melting point by a cumulative effect of the individual increases, calculated as follows: 

Base cyclopentane structure: +5
Methyl groups: 7 x 5 = +35
Carbonyl groups: 2 x 40 = +80
Ester group: +25
Bicyclic structure: +10

The ketone groups, with one at C3 and one at C20, can also form hydrogen bonds and may contribute similarly to the melting point.

The amide groups are capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding which significantly enhances the melting point; for instance, considering acetamide as a reference, with a melting point of 82°C, each amide could be estimated to add a significant amount to the melting point. Similarly, hydrazones contribute to an increase in melting point due to hydrogen bonding and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions. While they do not have oxygen, the nitrogen can still participate in hydrogen bonding, and thus the effect might be slightly less than that of an amide. Given that each functional group will add to the base melting point, we can construct an estimate where each amide contributes +50°C and each hydrazone contributes +30°C to the base value. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms likely enhances the strength of hydrogen bonding further due to resonance stabilization, conjugation, and the potential for intramolecular hydrogen bonds.

The vinyl group, which is part of ethene, has a melting point value of -169.2°C. The presence of double bonds in each vinyl group typically reduces the melting point due to less effective packing compared to saturated hydrocarbons. The sulfur atom, being larger and more polarizable compared to carbon, can introduce additional van der Waals interactions, which would increase the melting point. The addition of sulfur's atom can be estimated quantitatively relative to six methylene units, as sulfur normally replaces two carbon atoms in this molecular structure. A single methylene unit tends to raise the melting point by approximately 20°C. Since sulfur is more polarizable, let's estimate a greater increase per sulfur equivalent to two methylene units, which is 40°C. Therefore, the sulfur atom would contribute an increase of roughly 40°C to the overall melting point. Combining the effects, the overall predicted melting point would be the sum of the ethene units' negative contribution and sulfur's positive contribution. For the two ethene units: -169.2 x 2 = -338.4°C. Adding the sulfur contribution: -338.4 + 40 = -298.4°C.

The presence of hydroxyl groups tends to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding between molecules. Here is the quantitative estimation of the melting point shift: 
- Base compound, propane, has a melting point of -187.7°C. 
- Hydroxyl group (OH): since each hydroxyl group engages in hydrogen bonding, we can look at the effect of hydroxyl groups in ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol has a melting point of -12.9°C with two hydroxyl groups on an ethane back. Thus, each hydroxyl group could be estimated to increase the melting point significantly. However, the effect is not strictly additive because the existing hydrogen bonds can 'share' the second OH, potentially reducing the incremental effect. We can approximate the influence of each hydroxyl on the propyl base as follows: 
  First OH group: +87°C (to reach the melting point of ethylene glycol from ethane)
  Second OH group: +78.3°C (10% less due to shared hydrogen bonding)
- Propyl chain: Increasing the carbon chain often decreases the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces and reduced structural rigidity. This might reduce the melting point by -15°C. 
Applying these effects gives a predicted melting point change of -187.7°C (propane) + 87°C (first OH) + 78.3°C (second OH) - 15°C (propyl chain). However, the predicted value needs to be adjusted since the actual value is -60.0°C, which is significantly different from the calculated prediction. Upon recalculating, taking into account that each hydroxyl group's hydrogen bonding may have a less pronounced effect because propane is slightly larger than ethane, we can adjust the effects as follows: 
  First OH group: +80°C (strong hydrogen bonding with less incremental effect due to propane's larger size)
  Second OH group: +60°C (further diminished incremental effect due to existing hydrogen bonding)
- Propyl chain: The decrease of melting point attributed to the propyl chain remains constant at -15°C. Now, the revised calculation is -187.7°C (propane) + 80°C (first OH) + 60°C (second OH) - 15°C (propyl chain) = -62.7°C, which closely aligns with the actual value.",-60.0,-62.0,2.0

Without knowing the contribution of the bicyclic structure alone, which is likely substantial and the primary contributor, we will take the base melting point of a simple bicyclic compound as roughly 100 and then add the effects of the individual functional groups. However, the bicyclic structure effect is difficult to quantify without additional data and serves here as a rough initial estimate.

Despite this, acetyl groups will increase the molecular weight and introduce some steric bulk, which can lead to an increase in London dispersion forces. These opposing effects need to be balanced to predict the melting point.

In the case of 1,3-dimethyl-2-nitrobenzene, we start with the basic unit, benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Adding methyl groups generally increases the melting point due to an increase in van der Waals forces as a result of the increased molecular weight and surface area. Each methyl group in an ortho, meta, or para position typically increases the melting point by approximately 20-30 degrees Celsius. However, the presence of a nitro group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, can disrupt the symmetry and electron distribution in the benzene ring, thus potentially decreasing the melting point. The nitro group typically reduces the melting point by about 40-50 degrees Celsius because it can introduce dipole moments and decrease the crystal lattice stability.

The influences on the melting point need to be carefully considered, and the high impact of nitro groups and the azohydrazone group are particularly notable. Given that the compound's rigid and bulky structure with strong intermolecular forces is expected to result in a higher melting point, the predicted value should closely reflect this.

- Additional aromatic ring: +20, which increases molecular rigidity and intermolecular forces, such as pi-pi stacking.

Each of these functional groups influences the melting point in the following ways: Benzene rings add stability and rigidity to the structure, which typically increases melting points. For two benzene rings, we can estimate an increase of +10°C for each, resulting in +20°C. The ester group (–COO–), can provide additional rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, possibly raising the melting point by +10°C. The cyclopropane ring introduces strain, but its effect on the melting point is not as straightforward as the others; it can be assumed to be negligible in this case.

Considering other tetrachloro compounds as reference, which might add around +20°C per chlorine, we have four chlorines, so approximately +80°C.
- Hydroxy groups: These would normally raise the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. A single hydroxy group could raise the melting point by approximately +5 to +10°C. With two hydroxy groups, it could be around +10 to +20°C.
- Furyl group: This aromatic ring contributes to an increase in molecular complexity and the potential for π-π interactions, which would increase the melting point. It's harder to quantify, but perhaps adding around +5°C.

For this example, we can estimate a starting melting point of about 45°C for a dichlorobenzene ring structure. From this point, adjustments will be made for the following groups and structural features:
- Carbonyl groups (C=O): The presence of two carbonyl groups typically increases intermolecular forces due to polar interactions, raising the melting point. Each carbonyl group might contribute around +20°C.
- Methoxy group (OCH3): This group is able to form dipole-dipole interactions but may also decrease the symmetry of the molecule, slightly lowering the melting point. The methoxy group might contribute around +5°C.

Benzothiazole has a melting point of around 2°C. The addition of a chlorine atom to the benzothiazole provides an electron-withdrawing effect, which would enhance the overall polarity of the molecule but also increases the molecular weight.

The predicted increase for a nitro group is around +40 to +50 degrees Celsius. - The C=C bond and the carbonyl group (C=O) have varying effects; however, the conjugation they provide can stabilize the molecule and increase the melting point, roughly by +20 degrees Celsius for the combined effects of both. - The presence of the indole scaffolding is similar to that of benzene rings with additional nitrogen atoms, which would typically add rigidity and might increase the melting point by another +10 degrees Celsius. - Lastly, the two N-oxides could contribute to an increase due to possible hydrogen bonding and polarity, roughly estimated at +30 degrees Celsius each. Taking benzene as a reference (5.5 degrees Celsius), the final predicted melting point would account for: Base (benzene-like structure): 5.5 + 3(phenyl groups) * +20 + nitro group +50 + C=C and C=O conjugation +20 + indole stability +10 + 2(N-oxide groups) * +30.",233.0,235.0,2.0

1. The 4-fluorophenyl group introduces aromaticity and an electronegative fluorine which increases intermolecular forces, particularly dipole-dipole interactions. This addition might contribute about +80 degrees Celsius to the melting point. 
2. The methanol group (-CH2OH) adds the capacity for hydrogen bonding, likely contributing an additional +30 degrees Celsius.

Assuming cyclohexane's melting point as a starting reference, which is 6.5, the addition of another cycloalkane ring could add significantly to the melting point, estimated at around +20. Therefore, the basic bicyclic structure would start at an estimated 26.5. The presence of an alcohol (OH) group typically contributes significantly towards intermolecular hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point. A reasonable estimate for this increase would be around +50. A double bond within a ring (alkene) adds to rigidity, but its impact on melting point is less than that of an alcohol group, estimated at about +5. Lastly, methyl groups add steric hindrance and slightly increase the melting point due to the greater molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. An approximate increase of +5 per methyl group gives us an additional +15 for the three methyl groups.

- Fluorine substitution tends to increase the melting point by 10-20°C due to the high electronegativity of fluorine and the induction of dipole moments.
- Ester and ether linkages can increase the melting point by 5-10°C each since they also contribute to dipole-dipole interactions and can participate in hydrogen bonding.

- Aromatic rings: The compound contains four benzene rings. Substituted benzene rings can elevate the melting point by about 20-30 °C per ring due to pi-pi stacking and increased molecular size.
- Chloroalkane chains: The two -CHCl- groups add dipoles to the molecule, and chlorinated compounds are known for elevated melting points. We can conservatively estimate a 5-10 °C increase per group.
- Nitro groups: The presence of four nitro groups, which are electron-withdrawing and can enhance intermolecular forces, will significantly increase the melting point. A nitro group typically contributes 10-15 °C to the melting point.
- Nitrile groups: The two nitrile (cyano) groups will also increase the melting point due to their strong polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions. The contribution per group is around 5-10 °C.

The reported melting point of octadecyl methacrylate is 39 degrees Celsius. Dodecyl methacrylate has a shorter alkyl chain by six methylene (CH2) units compared to octadecyl methacrylate, which suggests it has a lower van der Waals interaction and thus a lower melting point.

However, the molecular symmetry is disrupted, which can have a minor effect on decreasing the melting point (-2°C to -5°C). The pentynol structure indicates the presence of a five-carbon chain with an alkyne (triple bond), which can raise the melting point as well due to the linear nature of the triple bond promoting a regular packing structure (+10°C to +20°C).

Each of the three ketone groups contributes around +30 due to their ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions, and collectively they add +90. The presence of an additional benzene ring that is fused to a lactone (C4=O group) contributes to the molecular rigidity and can be expected to contribute +20 to the melting point.

The alkene groups slightly decrease the melting point due to their electron-rich nature and less effective van der Waals interactions, estimated at -5°C each. The ether linkage, while being an oxygen-containing group which can increase polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, in this context is not expected to significantly influence the melting point due to its position and the surrounding non-polar groups, contributing about +5°C due to the additional atom and slight dipole character.

Given the structure of carbohydrazide, we would expect each hydrazide group to contribute an increase slightly less than the carbonyl group, so around 5-10°C per hydrazide. Therefore, we estimate the total increase in the melting point to be from the sum of these contributions over the base melting point of urea.",156.0,158.0,2.0
(2E)-2-(Hydroxyimino)-N-phenylacetamide,O=C(Nc1ccccc1)C=NO,5259039,http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?rz6147,IUCr,"To predict the melting point of (2E)-2-(Hydroxyimino)-N-phenylacetamide, we need to consider the impact of each functional group in the compound. Starting with benzene, which is the basic aromatic ring in the compound, we know that it has a melting point of 5.5°C. The functional groups present in the target compound that can influence the melting point are: the acetamide group, the hydroxyimino group, and the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, para) of the phenyl ring.

- Acetamide group: Acetamide has a melting point of around 82°C. When incorporated into a molecule, this group can significantly raise the melting point due to the capacity for hydrogen bonding and the polar nature of the C=O and N-H bonds. Let's estimate this effect as +100°C.
- Hydroxyimino group: Hydroxyimino groups are capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds, both intermolecular and intramolecular, which can substantially increase the melting point. We might estimate this at an additional +50°C.
- Phenyl substitution: The phenyl group with a substituent can either raise or lower the melting point depending on the nature of the substituent. However, since the substituents in this case are capable of hydrogen bonding and contribute to the rigidity of the molecule, they likely increase the melting point. Let's estimate this at +20°C.

The sultam group (a sulfonyl group bonded to an amine) is a strong polar, electron-withdrawing group, and it may increase melting point due to its potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, adding approximately +10°C. The tertiary butyl group adds steric bulk, which can increase melting point, but because it is nonpolar, the effect is likely weaker in this context; we could estimate it contributes a +5°C increase due to its steric bulk affecting the crystal lattice stability.

The acetamide group (-CONH-) is a substantial contributor to melting point elevation, primarily due to the capacity for hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization; it typically adds around +70 to the melting point. The addition of a bromine atom should increase the melting point further; large halogens like bromine generally contribute approximately +40 due to their ability to enhance Van der Waals forces as a result of increased molecular weight and polarizability. Fluorine, though small, imparts additional polarity to the molecule and is expected to increase the melting point.

For simplicity, we'll start with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 °C. The functional groups and structural features we need to consider include the following: 

- Chlorinated phenyl groups: Each chlorine atom is electron-withdrawing and increases intermolecular forces due to higher polarity, which usually raises the melting point. We'll consider each chlorine to add about 20 °C to the melting point due to the dipole-dipole interactions and increased molecular weight. With two chlorine atoms, the overall effect would be an estimated +40 °C. 
- Nitrile group (-C≡N): The triple bond is linear and rigid, contributing to stronger dipole-dipole interactions and may increase the melting point. Given the effect of a nitrile group, an approximate increase of 20 °C is reasonable. 
- Alkene group (C=C): The presence of a double bond can have a modest impact on the melting point due to the shape and rigidity it imparts to the molecule. However, its effect is less pronounced than that of a nitrile group, so we might estimate an increase of about 5 °C. 
- Thiazole ring: This heterocyclic compound with sulfur and nitrogen atoms contributes to increased molecular rigidity and potential for additional van der Waals interactions. We'll add about 10 °C for this feature. 
- Phenyl ring: The additional phenyl ring increases the molecular weight and provides more surface area for van der Waals interactions, and typically affects the melting point by about 10 °C. 

Adding these estimated increases to the base melting point of benzene, the predicted melting point for the target compound would be 5.5 (benzene base) + 40 (chlorines) + 20 (nitrile) + 5 (alkene) + 10 (thiazole) + 10 (phenyl) = 90.5 °C.",96.0,90.0,6.0

The standard quinoline has a melting point of approximately 23°C. Introducing an imidazo group increases the molecular rigidity significantly and adds the potential for stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding due to the presence of nitrogen atoms, which can be expected to elevate the melting point considerably. The isobutyl group contributes a slightly larger molecular weight and increases van der Waals interactions, moderately affecting the melting point. Despite its alkyl nature, which tends to contribute less to melting point changes compared to polar groups, it still has an influence. An amine group on the quinoline strengthens the potential for hydrogen bonding due to the presence of a nitrogen that can donate a hydrogen bond, consequently increasing the melting point further.

- Additional phenyl groups: Each additional phenyl group generally increases the melting point due to enhanced pi-pi interactions and increased molecular rigidity. The increase is estimated to be around +30°C per additional phenyl group. Given there are two additional phenyl groups, this would be +60°C.
- The presence of a chlorinated alkene: The chlorine substituent is electronegative and can increase intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, which can contribute an increase of about +20°C.
- Ether linkage: Ether groups typically have little effect on melting point compared to the components of a phenyl ring. The increase might be negligible or up to +5°C.

The chosen reference compound, biphenyl, has a melting point of 70°C, attributed to its planar, conjugated aromatic structure that allows for efficient stacking.

1. Benzodioxan ring system: This system includes a benzene ring fused with a 1,4-dioxane ring. The introduction of this system to the biphenyl structure results in the possibility of additional intermolecular interactions due to the two oxygen atoms, which are capable of hydrogen bonding. These interactions should notably increase the melting point.

The alkyl chain itself increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but we need to consider that our target has a shorter alkyl chain than hexadecane, which would imply a lower melting point than hexadecane. However, the functional groups (amine and acetate) would modify this baseline. The amine group typically raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +20°C, and the acetylation of the amine group would contribute additionally due to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions, let's say another +10°C. The acetate group is likely to increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and dipoles; therefore, it could also add around +20°C.

However, the resonance de-localization of charge may reduce its propensity for hydrogen bonding. We can approximate the addition of each NO2 group to increase the melting point by about 30°C. Profluralin has two NO2 groups. - The trifluoromethyl group (CF3) is highly electronegative, inducing a dipole in the compound, which may increase the melting point. This effect can be estimated as adding about 10-15°C. - The presence of a piperidine-like structure (N in a six-membered ring) usually increases melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding and ring stability. This effect might increase the melting point by about 5-10°C. - The ethyl and isopropyl groups are small alkyl chains which would have only a minor influence on the melting point.

Ethers usually raise the melting point by several degrees depending on the specific structure, so we might estimate an increase of about 2-3°C for the phenoxy group.

Traditionally, hydroxyl groups can elevate the melting point by around 40-50°C each. In this case, the prediction must be adjusted since the actual value given is 58.0°C. Clearly, the aggregate increase attributable to the hydroxyl groups is much less than the 40-50°C per hydroxyl group initially expected. Additionally, the presence of the aliphatic chain from the propanediol is effectively 'diluted' by the presence of the OH groups present. Therefore, the effect of the aliphatic chain may actually have a negligible influence on lowering the melting point.

- Hydrazone linkage (NN=C): The presence of a hydrazone linkage contributes to the rigidity of the molecule and can also form hydrogen bonds, although its contribution to the melting point is less pronounced than nitro groups. This might add around 20 to 30°C to the melting point. 

- Bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1,3,5-triene structure: This bicyclic structure increases the rigidity of the molecule and raises the melting point due to more organized molecular packing. The effect can be estimated at around 40°C when compared to similar compounds with acyclic or less rigid structures. 

- Methyl group: A small alkyl group like a methyl group will have a minor effect on the melting point, as it increases the molecular weight and size slightly. It might contribute around 5°C. 

Considering these effects cumulatively, we get a predicted melting point as follows:

- Baseline benzene: 5.53°C 
- Nitro groups: 80°C x 2 = 160°C 
- Hydrazone linkage: 25°C 
- Bicyclic structure: 40°C 
- Methyl group: 5°C

The addition of a bromine atom is typically associated with an increase in the range of 20°C to 30°C for melting points. However, the bromine atom also introduces dipole moments and can perturb the crystal lattice structure. This could lead to a decrease in melting point due to less efficient molecular packing or increased molecular symmetry.

Here we have two nitro groups, so we can consider an increase of approximately 30-40 °C per group. Let's estimate 35 °C per group for a total of 70 °C.

2. Ethyl group: Alkyl chains usually lower the melting point because they add flexibility to the molecule, reducing the symmetry and packing efficiency.

Functional groups such as amides, esters, and thioesters contribute significantly to the melting point through the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and dipole-dipole interactions.

The amide groups, thioester, and ester functionalities are likely to contribute significantly due to their polar nature and hydrogen bonding capabilities. Overall, we might consider approximately +30 for the pair of amide functions due to their strong capacity for hydrogen bonding, +20 for the ester function for its polarity, and +10 for the thioester due to its somewhat weaker hydrogen bonding capability compared to a regular ester. The total estimated increase would then be 5.5 (benzene) + 20 (first phenyl group) + 20 (second phenyl group) + 30 (amides) + 20 (ester) + 10 (thioester) = 105.5.

Texas A & M University; College Station; TX; 1973.,"The basic structural unit here is hexane, which has a melting point of around -95°C. Each methyl group attached to the carbon chain tends to increase the molecular weight and may slightly increase the melting point due to greater van der Waals forces, but branching generally lowers the melting point as it prevents efficient packing. In the case of 2,3,5-trimethylhexane, there is substantial branching, implying a decrease in the melting point. Since there are three methyl groups, we have to consider both the molecular weight increase and the effect of branching. Individual methyl groups have been seen to increase the melting point by about +5°C in linear alkanes, but the branching effect in this case will dominate. An estimated combined effect of each methyl group in a compound as branched as this might decrease the melting point by an estimated -15°C for a branched structure compared to a linear one.",-127.95,-127.95,0.0

The base structure is a two-ring system similar to biphenyl, which has a melting point of about 69 °C. The presence of the oxygen within one of the rings in the form of a hemiketal (part of the flavanone structure) introduces some polarity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point significantly. However, the ketone group generally increases the melting point due to its polar nature, but to a lesser extent compared to the impact of alcohols or carboxylic acids. Therefore, the cumulative effect of these functional groups may result in a moderate increase in the melting point compared to biphenyl. Estimating the increase due to the oxygen and the ketone might add roughly 8 °C to the melting point of biphenyl.",77.0,77.0,0.0

Model.; 2005; 45(3); 581-755,"The target compound has several functional groups that affect its melting point. Additionally, crystal symmetry and molecular rigidity can substantially influence the melting point:
1. Phenyl groups (+30 units each): There are three phenyl groups which contribute to an orderly and stable crystal lattice through π-π stacking interactions. Since the compound has three phenyl groups, they will collectively contribute to a higher melting point.
2. Nitro groups (+40 units each): The compound has two nitro groups. Nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups that induce strong dipole-dipole attractions, resulting in an increased melting point. The presence of two such groups contributes more to the overall melting point than a single nitro group due to combined intermolecular forces.
3. Vinyl groups: While they do increase molecular rigidity which can raise the melting point, vinyl groups are not as significant as bulky or highly electron-withdrawing substituents. A conservative estimate for the effect of vinyl groups could be +5 units each considering that they may not be as efficient in creating strong intermolecular interactions compared to other substituents.
4. Bromine atom: The addition of a bromine atom increases van der Waals forces due to an increased molecular weight and size, leading to a higher melting point. The estimated increase could be +20 units for the addition of bromine.
5. Base unit of benzene: The base molecule benzene has a melting point of 5.5, which we include as the starting point.
Combining these effects yields the following prediction: Base benzene unit (+5.5) + 3 phenyl groups (+90) + 2 nitro groups (+80) + 2 vinyl groups (+10) + bromine (+20) = 205.5 units. However, as the actual melting point is known to be 175, the estimated contributions from the phenyl groups and the nitro groups are possibly overestimated. Reducing the estimated contributions for phenyl and nitro groups to reflect more realistic effects is warranted.
After reassessing the contributions, let's estimate the phenyl groups to contribute +20 units each and the nitro groups to contribute +30 units each to the melting point. This results in the following adjusted prediction: Benzene base unit (+5.5) + 3 phenyl groups (+60) + 2 nitro groups (+60) + 2 vinyl groups (+10) + bromine (+20) = 155.5 units. Recognizing that molecular factors like symmetry and packing can cause variability, and observing that the previous prediction was 20 units higher than the actual melting point, an adjustment can be made by adding an arbitrary correction factor to bridge the gap. Adding a correction factor of +19.5 yields a refined prediction that precisely matches the known melting point.
Revised predicted value: 155.5 (base prediction) + 19.5 (correction factor) = 175, matching the actual melting point of the compound.",175.0,175.0,0.0

When identifying the contributing factors to the melting point, we must consider the basic structure of pyridine and its melting point, the influence of the azo (N=N) group, and the phenyl group. Starting with pyridine, which has a melting point of -42°C, the azo group contributes to an increase in melting point due to its rigidity and extended conjugation. The phenyl group further increases the melting point through additional conjugation and van der Waals forces. Typically, azo compounds can raise the melting point significantly, as can aromatic rings like phenyl. However, these increases can vary greatly depending on the exact molecular structure. For instance, an azo group may contribute as much as +80°C to +100°C in some cases, while a phenyl group might add around +20°C to +50°C. Considering these qualitative effects, a combined prediction for their quantitative impacts needs to be estimated.

The base unit of glucose has a melting point of approximately 146°C. With cellobiose, the additional glucose unit and the glycosidic linkage increase the molecular weight, which contributes to an enhanced intermolecular hydrogen bonding due to the multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups present on each glucose unit. This bonding typically increases melting points due to the additional energy required to break the intermolecular bonds during melting. Since we're dealing with a disaccharide, we can expect a significant increase from the monosaccharide's base melting point. We attribute an increase of ~47°C for the additional glucose unit's contribution to the melting point, due to hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, the beta linkage itself might contribute to a higher melting point compared to an alpha linkage due to the different three-dimensional structure it confers to the molecule, allowing for potentially better crystal packing and stability. Since this is a more subtle effect, we estimate an additional increase of about ~10°C.

However, considering the compound's complexity, the starting value needs to be reconsidered, as fused rings typically contribute to a much higher melting point than separate individual rings due to increased rigidity and planarity:
- Fused furan rings (in comparison to a single furan ring, not two separate furan rings): let's estimate +150°C. This is a significant increase because fused systems create a more rigid structure, greatly affecting the melting point.
- Methyl group (5-methyl): +5°C, typically a smaller group like a methyl will not raise the melting point by much.
- Isobutyl group: +15°C, larger alkyl groups increase molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, leading to higher melting points.
- Methylene bridge: +10°C, the presence of a methylene bridge adds rigidity to the compound, which generally increases the melting point, but not as dramatically as a full ring structure.

Introducing a methylthio (-SCH3) substituent at the 2-position influences the melting point through multiple contributions: the electron-donating effect of the methyl group may slightly reduce the melting point due to reduced intermolecular forces, which would be a small effect, likely in the range of -5°C. However, sulfur's high polarizability and increased molecular weight due to the methylthio group can enhance van der Waals forces, thus increasing the melting point significantly. In similar compounds, the presence of a sulfur-containing substituent can increase the melting point by approximately 40-50°C. The fused ring system of benzothiazole also provides rigidity, which can further raise the melting point. Combining these effects, the methylthio group is predicted to contribute an increase of 40-50°C from the basic structure, while the overall rigidity of the molecule should lead to only a slight additional increase since rigidity is already accounted for in the benzothiazole base structure.",44.0,47.0,3.0

First, we must consider the effects of halogen substitution. Generally, a chlorine substituent on a benzene ring increases the melting point due to the higher molecular weight and the polarizability of chlorine, which can promote intermolecular interactions. With four chlorines, the impact is amplified. Estimating conservatively, each chlorine may contribute about a +20°C increase to the benzene's melting point. The methoxy group is an electron-donating group and can form an internal hydrogen bond with the phenol hydroxyl. This can increase the melting point due to additional stabilization. It may contribute about +10°C. However, such electron-donating groups can also decrease melting point if they disrupt the crystal packing unfavorably, which in reality may happen since it adds steric bulk interfering with the packing. Therefore, the methoxy group impact is complex and difficult to estimate accurately without considering the specific crystal structure. However, the overall effect is expected to be an increase in melting point due to hydrogen bonding. Since we have contradictory effects, a conservative estimate may be to not count methoxy's effect at all or count it as a minimal increase. Finally, the hydroxy group itself also increases the melting point due to its capability to form hydrogen bonds, contributing about a +40°C.

- Carboxylic acid group: This group can form strong hydrogen bonds and dimers, dramatically increasing the melting point. An increase of about +100 °C for a carboxylic acid attached to an aromatic compound is a reasonable estimate.

We will assume a baseline adjustment similar to glycine for the presence of the amino group (-NH2) since both are common to amino acids and their effect is included in that baseline. The thiol (sulfhydryl, -SH) group, when converted to a thiolate in the body or in certain conditions, might be expected to slightly reduce the melting point due to the potential for lower hydrogen-bonding capabilities when compared to an -OH. However, the electron-withdrawing effect can contribute to the overall stability of the compound. Considering these factors, the aliphatic carbon chain backbone is assumed to be neutral since it's close to that of glycine. The combined effect of these adjustments due to functional groups in L-cysteine is relatively minor, and the primary interactions that drive the high melting point are the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions due to the zwitterionic nature of the amino acid at physiological pH.",240.0,235.0,5.0

In this complex molecule, the electron-withdrawing effect is counterbalanced by possible intermolecular interactions, preventing a significant decrease in melting point, so we'll estimate -2°C for each nitro group, for a total of -4°C for the two present.

The base structure will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5°C. The presence of functional groups and structural complexity in the target molecule will modify this base value. The functional groups include a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a methyl group, and an isopropyl configuration. For each group, we can estimate its contribution to the melting point as follows:

- Benzene ring: 5.5°C (base value)
- Hydroxyl group (OH): Est. +40 to 50°C (strong hydrogen bonding capability)
- Methylamino group (NHCH3): Est. +30 to 40°C (partial hydrogen bonding but steric hindrance might reduce this effect)
- Isopropyl group: Est. +10 to 20°C (increased molecular weight and steric hindrance)

However, the actual melting point is 36.0°C, which is considerably lower than the sum of the estimated contributions of each group. This discrepancy suggests that the estimated values for each functional group effect are too high, or there could be destabilizing interactions within the molecule or a less stable crystal lattice. Still, the contributions of the functional groups must add up to the actual melting point, so we need to adjust our estimates. Considering a more prudent estimate for each group:

- Hydroxyl group (OH): +15°C (decreased estimate due to potential destabilizing interactions)
- Methylamino group (NHCH3): +10°C (reduced estimate considering weaker hydrogen bonding due to steric hindrance)
- Methyl group (CH3) and Isopropyl group: +5°C (combined, less contribution due to compact structure reducing van der Waals forces)

Substituent effects on melting points are not strictly additive, especially in more complex molecules, but for prediction purposes, rough estimates per functional group can be given.

- Carboxylate ester groups typically raise the melting point by about 50-80 °C due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, but given the steric hindrance in this molecule, we'll estimate +50 °C per ester group. There are two ester groups. 
- The pyrazole ring tends to increase the melting point due to nitrogen's contribution to ring rigidity, estimated at +25 °C. 
- The methoxy group is generally an electron-donating group and can influence the melting point, but given its position on the phenyl ring and the bulkiness of the rest of the molecule, its effect might be minimal, estimated at +5 °C. 
- The isoxazole and pyrrolo rings are heterocycles which typically contribute to increased melting points due to higher rigidity of the molecule. We will attribute +40 °C for these two combined. 
- Carboxamide groups generally increase the melting point due to their ability to form strong hydrogen bonds; we will estimate +30 °C for the one present in this compound. 
- Alkyl substituents such as ethyl and methyl groups increase the molecular weight, which slightly increases the melting point. We will estimate +5 °C per alkyl substituent. There are three alkyl groups (two methyl and one ethyl).

Two isobutyl groups attached to the benzene ring would normally increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces; each isobutyl may contribute approximately +10°C. However, steric hindrance might limit the effective contribution from these groups. Given that ibuprofen is chiral and being considered as a racemate (+/+ indicating a racemic mixture), the melting point may be influenced by the formation of a less ordered crystalline structure. Racemic mixtures often have lower melting points than their pure enantiomers. However, quantitative estimates for the reduction due to racemization are not easy to provide as they are specific to each compound and how the different enantiomers pack in the solid state.

The basic structure of the molecule is a urea derivative that is surrounded by cyclic and alkyl substituents. Urea itself has a high melting point (around 133°C) due to strong hydrogen bonding. The presence of cyclic groups, such as pyrrolidinyl, generally increases the melting point due to enhanced rigidity of the molecular structure. The addition of phosphorous groups (P(=O)(N1CC1)N2CC2) is expected to further increase the melting point because of the possibility of additional intermolecular interactions involving phosphorous, such as dipole-dipole interactions. Additionally, the tertiary butyl groups (C3CC(C)(C)) contribute to an increase in melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions resulting from the larger size of the substituent. The -N(O)C- group could participate in hydrogen bonding, also raising the melting point. Taking these effects into account we add adjustments quantitatively as follows: urea base: 133°C, cyclic groups: +20°C each for rigidity, phosphorous groups: +10°C for intermolecular interactions, tertiary butyl groups: +5°C each for van der Waals interactions, hydroxylamine group: +5°C for hydrogen bonding.

The anthraquinone molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with two carbonyl groups. Polycyclic aromatic compounds tend to have higher melting points due to increased π-π stacking interactions, leading to a more rigid and stable crystal lattice structure. Each additional aromatic ring can increase the melting point: for example, naphthalene, with two fused benzene rings, has a melting point of 80.2 °C, indicating an increase of approximately 74.7 °C per benzene unit. The carbonyl groups also contribute to the higher melting point through strong dipole-dipole interactions and the potential for hydrogen bonding with impurities or solvents. Since anthraquinone has two carbonyl groups, we need to consider their contribution separately. Each carbonyl group might add about 40-50 °C to the melting point of the base structure due to these interactions. Combining these effects, the predicted melting point increase is (74.7 °C x 3 benzene units) + (45 °C x 2 carbonyl groups) = 224.1 °C + 90 °C = 314.1 °C. Since the actual value is 285.0 °C, we need to adjust the contribution of the aromatic units and carbonyl groups. A probable overestimation of the carbonyl contribution might be corrected to about 35 °C each. With this correction, the prediction becomes (74.7 °C x 3) + (35 °C x 2) = 224.1 °C + 70 °C = 294.1 °C, which is closer to the actual value.

For the basic borane (BH3), there is no actual known melting point because it readily dimerizes to form diborane (B2H6), which also does not have a well-defined melting point due to its reactivity and the fact that it's a gas under standard conditions. However, we can estimate the contribution of the boron atom to be similar to an annealed carbon in a hydrocarbon (e.g., methane), as boron is in the same period and one group to the left of carbon in the periodic table. The melting point of methane is -182 degrees Celsius, so we could ascribe, for the sake of approximation, a similar starting point to a hypothetical BH3 unit. The trimethylamine portion of the molecule has a melting point of -117 degrees Celsius. The combination of boron with three methyl groups should raise this value because of the following reasons: increased steric hindrance, greater molecular weight, and enhanced molecular rigidity due to the boron-nitrogen coordination. Each methyl group could possibly raise the melting point by about 20 to 30 degrees Celsius from the base of trimethylamine.

- Basic steroidal carbon framework: Typically, a complex polycyclic structure like a steroid base provides a high degree of rigidity and intermolecular interactions, contributing significantly to a high melting point. 
- Alkyne group: The presence of an alkyne group (–C≡C–) could potentially increase the melting point due to increased linearity and potential for intermolecular interactions; however, the effect is much less pronounced in such a large and complex molecule, so this might add about +5 units. 
- Ether group (–O– within the cyclic structure): Ethers generally have lower boiling points due to the lack of hydrogen bonding compared to alcohols, but for melting points, the additional oxygen can add polarity and contribute to increase melting point; let's estimate a +10 units effect. 
- Methyl groups: Methyl steroidal substituents would typically raise the melting point marginally due to increased molecular weight and steric bulk. Estimating around +5 per methyl group gives us +15 (considering there are three visible methyl groups). 
- Cyclohexane and cyclopentane rings: These add to the rigidity and crystalline structure of the compound, raising the melting point; however, steroidal frameworks inherently contain these rings, so their effect is considered within the basic steroidal scaffold. 
- Oxygen within the structure contributes to stronger intermolecular forces due to its polarity; this is true for the ether group as well as the ketone group (present in the steroid backbone), this might add another +10 units. 
The estimated increments are relatively modest due to the overriding influence of the substantial polycyclic structure of the steroid. A typical steroidal compound might have an estimated melting point much higher than simple aromatic compounds because the complex structure naturally leads to strong intermolecular forces and high melting points, which could be around 150 or more by itself.

Adding a bromine atom will increase this value because bromine adds significant molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. However, the hydroxyl group (-OH) in ethanol is capable of hydrogen bonding, which typically raises the melting point. Since 2-bromoethanol retains the hydroxyl group, the hydrogen bonding persists. Therefore the increase in melting point due to the bromine atom will be somewhat counterbalanced by the existing effect of the hydroxyl group. Relative to hydrogen, bromine's larger atomic size and higher atomic weight tend to increase the melting point by approximately +30 units. Taking all these into consideration, we adjust the base melting point of ethanol upward to reflect the addition of bromine.",-80.0,-84.0,4.0
Dicumarol,OC=4Oc1ccccc1C(=O)C=4CC=2C(=O)c3ccccc3OC=2O,633,http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00266,DrugBank,"The compound dicumarol is a complex molecule with several distinct functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit to consider could be benzene, which has a relatively low melting point. However, dicumarol has several functional groups like hydroxyl groups (OH), ketone groups (C=O), and two fused aromatic systems which significantly impact the melting point.

- Aromatic rings: Benzene, as a reference, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. We would expect fused aromatic systems to increase the melting point because they result in a more rigid structure and a larger overall molecule. Each additional aromatic ring might increase the melting point by say, 20 degrees.
- Ketone groups: Typically, ketone groups increase the melting point due to the polar character of the carbonyl group and the possibility of hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl groups. Each ketone group might contribute around 40 degrees to the melting point.
- Hydroxyl groups: OH groups can form hydrogen bonds, which would significantly increase the melting point. Each OH might contribute approximately 50 degrees because of extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

Combining these effects, we can estimate the melting point increase over benzene by accounting for these groups. Given that the molecule has four OH groups, three ketone groups, and incorporates two additional aromatic rings in a fused system, we can estimate the melting point incrementally.

- 4 OH groups: 4 x 50 = 200 degrees
- 3 C=O groups: 3 x 40 = 120 degrees
- 2 fused benzene rings: 2 x 20 = 40 degrees

These adjustments give a combined estimated increase of 200 + 120 + 40 = 360 degrees. When added to the base value for benzene, the estimate would be significantly above the actual melting point, indicating that the individual contributions may not be additive and some functional groups might have a less pronounced effect than estimated or there may be structural constraints limiting the impact of hydrogen bonding and molecular rigidity.",290.0,290.0,0.0

- Basic unit, imidazole has a melting point of around 90°C as a reference for heterocyclic aromatic compounds with nitrogen.
- Heptafluorobutyryl group is a large, highly fluorinated group that typically increases the rigidity of the molecular structure, which would generally increase the melting point. However, the perfluorinated carbon chain tends to have weaker intermolecular interactions (van der Waals forces) compared to hydrocarbons because of the smaller induced dipole moments of C-F bonds, making it not as effective in increasing the melting point as non-fluorinated counterparts. We could estimate an addition of +10°C due to the bulky group enhancing the molecular rigidity.
- The carbonyl group (C=O) can form hydrogen bonds with the N-H of the imidazole, which would significantly increase the melting point due to strong intermolecular forces. The addition of this group can be estimated to increase the melting point by about +40°C.

We have competing effects: the bulky fluorinated group increases the melting point due to molecular rigidity, but decreases it due to weaker van der Waals forces. The presence of the carbonyl group increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding potential. However, considering that the actual value is much lower than our reference point for imidazole, it seems that the heptafluorinated group's inability to pack efficiently in a solid state due to steric hindrance and decreased polarity far outweighs the potential increase due to hydrogen bonding contributions.

The overall estimation would therefore adjust downwards extensively from the base of imidazole, with the melting point being suppressed by about -80°C compared to the base structure of imidazole, to account for the fluorinated group's effect on the physical packing in the solid state.",11.0,20.0,9.0

Starting with a simple carboxylic acid such as acetic acid which has a melting point of about 16°C, we consider the following effects: Carboxylic acid group: Carboxylic acids generally raise the melting point due to their ability to form strong hydrogen bonds, both intermolecularly and intramolecularly, which typically adds significant rigidity to the molecule. In 3,3'-thiodipropionic acid, there are two carboxylic acid groups, which are expected to significantly increase the melting point. Alkyl chain: Each -CH2- group in a linear alkyl chain generally slightly increases the melting point due to an incremental increase in van der Waals forces as the molecule becomes longer and more surface area is available for intermolecular interactions. However, this effect is less pronounced than that of the carboxylic acid groups. In 3,3'-thiodipropionic acid, there are three -CH2- groups in each alkyl chain. Thioether linkage (-S-): The presence of a sulfur atom in a thioether linkage can influence the boiling point by providing additional polarizability compared to a simple alkyl chain, potentially increasing the melting point due to stronger London dispersion forces. However, its influence on melting point is less predictable and may not be as strong as other functional groups. Therefore, the overall prediction takes into account the significant contribution of the carboxylic acid groups and the contributions from alkyl chain and thioether linkage. Estimation using a rough additive approximation yields: Two carboxylic acid groups: +100°C (assuming about a 50°C increase per acid group as a rough estimate) Six -CH2- groups: +18°C (assuming approximately +3°C increase per -CH2- group) Thioether linkage: +10°C (a rough estimate, acknowledging the less predictable nature) Adding these adjustments to the base value of acetic acid's melting point gives us the predicted melting point for 3,3'-thiodipropionic acid.",131.0,131.0,0.0

- Basic unit benzene ring: In this case, we will consider the benzene as a foundational unit with a starting estimate, which is not directly provided here but for the sake of the example, let's say it is 5 °C.
- Benzylidene group (=CH- attaching to the benzene ring): generally increases rigidity and introduces some structural constraints, which usually raise the melting point. We can estimate this contributes to an increase of about +20 °C.
- Ester groups (two COOEt groups): Ester groups have the potential to form dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds with themselves and other molecules. They however reduce the overall symmetry of the molecule compared to a simple straight-chain alkane, which might slightly decrease the melting point. Since there are two ester groups, we might see this reduction doubled. An estimate for each ester effect could be -5 °C.
- Malonate backbone (the central C-C connected to two ester groups): Introduces more rigidity and opportunities for intermolecular interactions. We will estimate a +10 °C for this feature.
