        "Reason": "The basic unit for pyridazine would be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. However, the presence of two nitrogen atoms replacing two CH groups in the ring decreases the symmetry of the molecule compared to benzene and increases the polarity. Each nitrogen in the ring could decrease the melting point by approximately -6 to -8\u00b0C due to the contribution of intermolecular hydrogen bonding with neighboring molecules being less effective than in benzene. Additionally, the presence of a second nitrogen adjacent to the first may not have a simple additive effect because the changes they induce in electronic distribution and molecular packing could be non-linear. We can estimate the net effect to be a reduction of about 7\u00b0C for each nitrogen atom.",
