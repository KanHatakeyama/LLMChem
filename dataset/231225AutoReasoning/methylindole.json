        "Reason": "The basic unit here is indole, which has a melting point of around 52\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group (CH3) to the molecule tends to increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular size and van der Waals forces. However, indole's melting point is also determined by resonance stability and hydrogen bonding capabilities of the NH group. Methyl substituents on an aromatic ring typically raise the melting point by about 20 to 30\u00b0C under standard conditions, but the resonance stabilization and hydrogen bonding in indole may reduce this effect. Therefore, we could conservatively estimate the contribution of the methyl group to be around +10\u00b0C.",
