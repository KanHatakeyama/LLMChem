        "Reason": "The target compound, cyanogen, contains cyano groups that significantly influence the melting point. Starting with a base compound like ethane (having a melting point around -172 degrees Celsius), we incorporate the effects of the cyano groups. Each cyano group is highly electronegative, rigid, and capable of strong dipole-dipole interactions. Although these groups may increase the boiling point due to strong dipole forces, their linear and compact structure makes the compound relatively volatile, not increasing the melting point as much as the boiling point. Estimating the influence of each cyano group to be about +20 degrees Celsius due to these considerations, we calculate the predicted melting point.",

        "Reason": "Starting from the base compound of ethane, which has a melting point of approximately -172 degrees Celsius, we consider the effects of replacing hydrogen atoms with cyano groups. Each cyano group brings highly electronegative elements (nitrogen and carbon in a triple bond), promoting stronger intermolecular forces compared to ethane. These forces can be attributed mainly to dipole-dipole interactions, given that cyano groups have a strong permanent dipole moment. Despite the increase in intermolecular forces, the linear and non-bulky nature of the cyano groups does not lead to a significant increase in the melting point, as these structures tend to pack less effectively in the solid state, which could mitigate the impact of stronger dipole-dipole interactions. Thus, the effect of introducing each cyano group is estimated to increase the melting point by roughly +70 degrees Celsius compared to ethane.",
