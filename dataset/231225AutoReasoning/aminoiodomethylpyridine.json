        "Reason": "The molecule 2-amino-3-iodo-5-methylpyridine has several functional groups affecting its melting point. The base structure, pyridine, has a melting point of -42\u00b0C (231 K). Amino (-NH2) and iodo (I) substituents both increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding (amino group) and stronger van der Waals interactions (iodo group). The methyl (CH3) group is smaller and has less impact on the melting point compared to iodo and amino groups but still increases it slightly due to increased molecular weight. Amino group: +40 to +50\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions; Iodo group: +60 to +70\u00b0C due to significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces; Methyl group: +5 to +10\u00b0C due to a minor increase in molecular weight. The sum of the specific values provides the predicted melting point.",
