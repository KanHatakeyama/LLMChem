        "Reason": "The basic unit, ethene (or ethylene), has a melting point of around -169.2 degrees Celsius. The addition of a chlorine atom to one of the carbons in ethene increases the molecular weight and polarizability which should raise the melting point, but chlorine's electronegativity and the resultant dipole also contribute to an increased intermolecular force compared to ethene. The polar chloro group should have a significant effect on the melting point, more so than an equivalent hydrocarbon substituent due to the polarity it contributes. We can estimate the addition of a chlorine atom to raise the melting point by approximately 10-20 degrees Celsius, considering its size and electronegativity.",
