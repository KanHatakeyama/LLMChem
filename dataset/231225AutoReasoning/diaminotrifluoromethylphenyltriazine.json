        "Reason": "The target compound, 2,4-diamino-6-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3,5-triazine, is based on a triazine ring which contributes to a higher melting point due to its aromatic nature and nitrogen content. A basic triazine has a melting point of approximately 120 degrees Celsius. Each amino group, being polar and having the ability to form hydrogen bonds, can increase the melting point by about 30 degrees. The compound has two amino groups which in total add about 60 degrees to the base value. The presence of a phenyl ring adds an additional aromatic system to the molecule, which typically increases the melting point by about 20 degrees because of the increased molecular rigidity and pi stacking. Furthermore, the trifluoromethyl group attached to the phenyl ring is a strongly electronegative substituent that increases the compound's thermal stability, contributing approximately 10 degrees increase to the melting point due to its induction effects and the strong carbon-fluorine bonds.",
        "Prediction": "210 degrees Celsius. (Base triazine: 120 + Amino groups: 60 + Phenyl: 20 + Trifluoromethyl: 10)",
