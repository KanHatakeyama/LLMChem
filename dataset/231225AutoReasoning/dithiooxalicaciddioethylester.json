        "Reason": "The molecule in question is composed of a dithiooxalic acid core with two ethyl ester groups:\n- Base unit (similar to dithiooxalic acid which is a derivative of oxalic acid with a melting point around 190\u00b0C): -125\u00b0C (since thiocarbonyl groups generally lower the melting point compared to carbonyl due to weaker intermolecular interactions and lower symmetry).\n- Ethyl ester groups: -2x18\u00b0C (the introduction of alkoxy carbonyl groups usually reduces the melting point compared to the acid, due to losing the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the molecules).\n\nTherefore, by adding the effects of the changes to the base unit, we can estimate the melting point of the compound.",
