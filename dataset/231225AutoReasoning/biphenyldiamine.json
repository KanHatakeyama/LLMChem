        "Reason": "The target compound, 2,4'-biphenyldiamine, consists of two benzene rings connected by a single covalent bond, and each ring has an amino (-NH2) group attached to it. To predict the melting point, consider benzene as the base structure plus the influence of added functional groups and structural changes:\n- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.\n- The addition of a second benzene ring in a biphenyl configuration adds to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, increasing the possible pi-pi stacking and hence Van der Waals interactions, which could increase the melting point by, say, +80\u00b0C.\n- Amino groups are capable of hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point due to intermolecular attractions. Each amino group is expected to contribute considerably to the melting point, let's estimate +20\u00b0C for each, so +40\u00b0C in total for two amino groups.\nThe aforementioned numbers are just estimations, and the final prediction may need to be adjusted to reflect the actual melting point.",

The molecule has two aromatic rings connected by a single bond, enhancing pi-pi interactions and Van der Waals forces due to increased planarity and rigidity, which could hypothetically increase the melting point by an estimated +30\u00b0C. The amino groups contribute to the melting point through hydrogen bonding; each amino group can be estimated to add about +10\u00b0C to the melting point.
