        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point around -42\u00b0C. The introduction of a chlorine atom typically raises the melting point due to the increase in polarizability and possible dipole-dipole interactions; this effect can be estimated at +50\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group also raises the melting point due to its strong electronegativity, which contributes to dipole-dipole interactions, as well as its size increasing the molecular weight; its effect might be estimated at around +25\u00b0C. Combining these effects, we calculate the expected change in melting point as a sum of the contributions from each substituent.",
