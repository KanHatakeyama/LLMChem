        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-Octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane, we will consider the effects of fluorination and the presence of iodine atoms in the molecule. Starting with the basic butane molecule, which has a melting point of -138.3\u00b0C, fluorination generally increases melting point due to the higher electronegativity of fluorine compared to hydrogen, which leads to stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine substitution should significantly raise the melting point. We can estimate this effect to be around +10\u00b0C per fluorine atom. However, the presence of heavy iodine atoms likely has a larger effect due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each iodine might contribute around +25\u00b0C to the melting point. There are 8 fluorine and 2 iodine atoms in the compound.",
        "Prediction": "-138.3 (butane base) + 8(10) (fluorine) + 2(25) (iodine) = -138.3 + 80 + 50 = -8.3",
        "Prediction(integer)": -8.0
