        "Reason": "Our target compound 2-iodobutane ('CCC(C)I') can be thought of as starting from butane, which has a melting point around -138 degrees Celsius. Each functional group in the molecule will affect this baseline melting point. The alkyl chain (butane) provides a base melting point, while the iodine atom, being large and heavy, will significantly influence the melting point. Typically, the presence of a halogen like iodine raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and the polar nature of the carbon-halogen bond leading to stronger intermolecular interactions. In the case of iodobutane, the iodine atom is likely to raise the melting point. However, since butane and 2-iodobutane differ in their branching as well, the branched compound (2-iodobutane) would generally have a lower melting point than a straight-chain isomer due to less efficient packing. Iodine atom: +30 (increase due to molecular weight and polarizability), Branching effect: -4 (reduction in melting point due to less efficient packing).",
