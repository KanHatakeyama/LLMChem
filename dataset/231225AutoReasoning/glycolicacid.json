        "Reason": "Base molecule, methanol has a melting point of -97.6\u00b0C. The carboxyl group (COOH) generally raises the melting point because it allows the molecule to participate in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which would increase the melting point significant amount (let's estimate +170\u00b0C). Additionally, the hydroxyl group (OH) attached to the adjacent carbon also participates in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point further; however, its effect will be less than that of the carboxyl group due to already being accounted in the hydrogen bonding of the carboxyl group, and it being a single hydroxyl group (let's estimate an additional +5\u00b0C).",
