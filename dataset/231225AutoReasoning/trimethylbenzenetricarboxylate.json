        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Each carboxylate ester (C(=O)OC) group increases the melting point due to its capacity for increased hydrogen bonding and dipolar interactions as well as the rigid structure it confers to the molecule. Given that there are three such groups, and the melting point elevation provided by each is approximately +40 degrees Celsius, we can sum the effects. The three methyl (CH3) groups, however, have a smaller effect on the melting point, slightly increasing it by about +5 degrees Celsius each due to increased Van der Waals forces and molecular weight. Summing the contributions: Benzene (5.5) + 3 carboxylate ester groups (3*40) + 3 methyl groups (3*5).",
