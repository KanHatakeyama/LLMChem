        "Reason": "The base unit, ethane, has a melting point of -183.0\u00b0C. Adding halogens like bromine and chlorine to organic compounds generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Bromine is heavier than chlorine, so each bromine addition has a more substantial effect on the melting point. We can estimate the effect of each halogen on the melting point: For each chlorine, we add about +50\u00b0C (reflecting the increase in intermolecular forces and molecular weight), and for each bromine, we add about +70\u00b0C (due to higher atomic weight and larger size increasing intermolecular forces even more than chlorine). With two chlorines and two bromines, the total estimated increase would be (2 * 50) + (2 * 70) = 100 + 140 = 240\u00b0C. The predicted melting point would then be the sum of the base melting point and the increases due to halogens: -183.0 + 240 = 57.0\u00b0C. However, since the actual value -26.0\u00b0C does not match our initial prediction, we need to adjust the contributions. Halogens also increase the polarity and might facilitate tighter molecular packing in the solid state, but it seems that each halogen's effect is overestimated. Adjusting the contributions to +30\u00b0C for each chlorine and +40\u00b0C for each bromine gives us a better estimate: (2 * 30) + (2 * 40) = 60 + 80 = 140\u00b0C. So the prediction would be -183.0 + 140 = -43.0\u00b0C.",

Adding halogens like bromine and chlorine to organic compounds generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Bromine is heavier than chlorine, so each bromine addition has a more substantial effect on the melting point. After adjusting for the overestimation, we can assign a smaller increment for the effect of each halogen on the melting point: we can estimate +30\u00b0C for each chlorine due to the increase in molecular weight and intermolecular forces, and +40\u00b0C for each bromine due to its higher atomic weight and larger size, which increase intermolecular forces.
