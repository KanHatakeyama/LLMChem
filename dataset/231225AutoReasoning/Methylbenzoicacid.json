        "Reason": "Starting from benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, the introduction of functional groups will alter this value. The addition of a methyl group typically raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and Van der Waals forces; let's estimate this increase at +20 degrees. A carboxylic acid group significantly raises the melting point because it can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and dimerize; we can estimate this increase at about +80 degrees. Therefore: Benzene base (+5.5) + Methyl group (+20) + Carboxylic acid group (+80) = 106 degrees Celsius.",
