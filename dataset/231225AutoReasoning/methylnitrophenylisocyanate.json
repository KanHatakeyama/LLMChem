        "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 2-methyl-4-nitrophenyl isocyanate, we need to consider the effects of the functional groups involved. The basic structure is a benzene ring, which typically has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. A methyl group (\u2013CH3) is usually a weak electron donor via the inductive effect and can slightly increase the melting point, say by about 5\u00b0C. The nitro group (\u2013NO2) is an electron-withdrawing group and often has a significant impact on melting point due to its ability to facilitate intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding; it might increase the melting point by about 80\u00b0C. The isocyanate group (\u2013N=C=O) is polar and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, potentially raising the melting point further by approximately 30\u00b0C. Adding this all up, we predict an increase in melting point due to each functional group: 5\u00b0C for the methyl group, 80\u00b0C for the nitro group, and 30\u00b0C for the isocyanate group. Starting with the base value for benzene, the calculation yields the predicted melting point.",

A methyl group (\u2013CH3) typically increases the melting point slightly due to its larger molecular weight and weak electron donor characteristics, let's estimate this increase to be about 5\u00b0C. The nitro group (\u2013NO2) is strongly electron-withdrawing and enhances intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can drastically increase the melting point; we can estimate this increase to be around 50\u00b0C due to its significant impact. The isocyanate group (\u2013N=C=O) is a highly polar group that can form strong dipole-dipole interactions, likely increasing the melting point by around 20\u00b0C. Adding these effects to the base melting point of benzene gives us the predicted melting point for the compound.",
