Dibenz[a,h]anthracene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of four fused benzene rings, which significantly increases the molecular complexity and rigidity of the structure, resulting in a higher melting point. Fused benzene rings: each additional ring adds approximately +60 to +100 degrees Celsius because of increased pi-pi interactions and molecular rigidity. Predicting a roughly additive effect of these increments for four rings would result in an increase of (+60 * 3) to (+100 * 3), since the first ring is our reference point (benzene itself).",
