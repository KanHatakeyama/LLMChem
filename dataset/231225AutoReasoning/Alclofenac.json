        "Reason": "Alclofenac has several functional groups that influence its melting point. Starting with benzene as the basic unit which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we consider the following modifications: - The presence of chlorine substituent would increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and electronegativity which enhances intermolecular interactions, such as dipole-dipole attractions. This effect might add approximately +40\u00b0C. - The ethyl (C=C) group slightly increases the molecular weight and can introduce some steric hinderance, possibly resulting in a +5\u00b0C increase. - The ester group (COO) raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules and the polarity it introduces; this could be a +50\u00b0C increase. - However, the presence of the acetyl (CC(=O)O) group introduces a rigid planar structure that can stack well, significantly raising the melting point. This could contribute as much as +80\u00b0C to the melting point. Combining these adjustments, we get the total predicted increase in melting point.",

        "Reason": "Alclofenac features a benzene ring as its core structure, which has a baseline melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Addition of functional groups will modify this base value. - The chlorine atom, due to its high electronegativity and the polarizability of the resulting C-Cl bond, as well as the additional van der Waals forces it facilitates, typically increases the melting point. This addition may contribute an estimated +40\u00b0C. - The vinyl group (ethenyl, C=C) is a relatively small group and not highly electron-withdrawing, so its effect on the melting point would likely be relatively modest, perhaps around +5\u00b0C. - The ester group (COO) is a polar functional group capable of engaging in dipole-dipole interactions, and might raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to these intermolecular forces. - The acetyl group (CC(=O)O) is planar and may enable better packing and stacking in the solid state, potentially adding another +20\u00b0C to the melting point. Adding these values to the baseline gives an estimated total increase.",
