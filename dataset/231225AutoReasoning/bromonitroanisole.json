        "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by various factors like molecular weight, polarity, intermolecular forces, and symmetry. In the case of 4-bromo-3-nitroanisole, the basic unit to consider is anisole which essentially is a methoxybenzene. The methoxy group (-OCH3) contributes electron-donating properties via resonance and slight dipole moment to the benzene ring, affecting the melting point.\n- Anisole (methoxybenzene) base melting point: -37\u00b0C\nFunctional groups modifying the melting point:\n- Bromide (Br): +57\u00b0C (larger halogen, increases molecular weight, dipolar interactions, and van der Waals forces)\n- Nitro group (-NO2): +81\u00b0C (highly electronegative, attracts electrons, forms stronger intermolecular forces, and creates a large dipole)\n\nThe combination of electronegative and bulky groups like bromide and the nitro group significantly enhances the melting point from the base structure of anisole due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of strong dipolar interactions.\nCombined effect: 57 + 81 = 138\u00b0C\nAdjustment for the interaction of groups and overall molecular symmetry: -107\u00b0C (as polar groups may counterbalance each other slightly lowering the melting point)",
