        "Reason": "The base structure for 17-oxoandrostan-3-yl acetate can be considered as androstane, which is a tetracyclic hydrocarbon ring with a rough estimation of a melting point around 100\u00b0C, comparable to other similar sized steroidal hydrocarbons. Each functional group will alter this baseline melting point: the ketone (oxo) group generally increases the melting point due to polarizability and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, adding roughly +20\u00b0C. The ester (acetate) group is polar and capable of dipole-dipole interactions, which also raises the melting point, although to a lesser extent than the ketone. The ester group can be estimated to add around +10\u00b0C. However, due to the steroidal structure which is rigid and bulky, it contributes to a higher melting point through increased van der Waals interactions and packing efficiency in the solid state. This can add another +8\u00b0C. Therefore, adding these contributions together gives the predicted melting point.",
