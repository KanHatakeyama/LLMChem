        "Reason": "The basic structure for comparison is the steroid nucleus which typically has a melting point range of 170-200. The basic steroid nucleus contains four fused rings - three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring. Fluprednisolone has several functional groups grafted onto this basic structure: a fluorine atom, a ketone group, a methyl group, an alcoholic hydroxyl group, and a carboxylic acid ester group. The fluorine atom, being highly electronegative, increases intermolecular forces very slightly: +5. The ketone groups have polar carbon-oxygen double bonds which lead to dipole-dipole interactions: +20 for the contribution of each ketone group to the overall melting point. The methyl group, being electron-donating and nonpolar, has a very small effect on melting point, but can be estimated as: +5 due to slightly increased van der Waals forces. The primary hydroxyl group contributes to hydrogen bonding, thus significantly increasing the melting point by: +20. The carboxylic acid ester has polar characteristics contributing to dipole-dipole attractions and also has a potential role in hydrogen bonding: +15. Adding these adjustments to the lower end of the typical steroid nucleus melting point gives an approximate total increase.",
        "Prediction": "Melting point = 170 (base steroid) + 5 (fluorine) + 2x20 (two ketone groups) + 5 (methyl group) + 20 (primary hydroxyl group) + 15 (carboxylic acid ester) = 255\u00b0C",

        "Reason": "The basic structure for comparison is the steroid nucleus which typically has a melting point range of 170-200. Fluprednisolone has additional functional groups attached to this base structure. A fluorine atom will increase the melting point, given that it is highly electronegative and enhances intermolecular forces, approximately: +5. Each ketone group contributes to dipole-dipole interactions significantly; however, an estimate of +20 for each ketone group is too high for compounds like steroids with multiple ring structures. A more modest increase per ketone would likely be: +5. The methyl group's influence is relatively minor due to the substantial existing molecular framework of the steroid, which mitigates the incremental effect of smaller alkyl groups on melting point; a potential contribution might be closer to: +2. The hydroxyl group, capable of strong hydrogen bonding, can substantially increase the melting point, but +20 might also be high considering the overall molecular context and steric effects, likely: +10. The carboxylic acid ester, while polar and capable of participating in hydrogen bonding, probably does not add as much to the melting point as a free acid would; therefore, the increase could be more conservative, for instance: +10. Adjusting these contributions, the predicted value should be recalibrated.",

        "Reason": "The compound fluprednisolone consists of several functional groups and structural features that affect its melting point:\n- Steroid backbone: Steroids typically have a high melting point due to their rigid, planar structure and strong intermolecular forces, so this provides a high basal value.\n- Hydroxyl groups (-OH): Each hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds, which usually increases the melting point significantly. Assuming we have 3 hydroxyl groups, if each contributes +30 degrees to the melting point: 3 * 30 = +90.\n- Ketone groups (C=O): Ketones can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. Let's estimate two ketone groups to contribute +20 degrees each to the melting point: 2 * 20 = +40.\n- Fluorine substitution: Fluorine is highly electronegative and its presence could increase the melting point due to strong dipole-dipole interactions. The impact of one fluorine might add +10.\n- Methyl groups (CH3): The presence of methyl groups may have a mixed effect. They can increase the molecular weight and the surface area for van der Waals interactions, but they might also hinder packing.
