        "Reason": "The basic structure is benzene which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of the nitrile (C#N) group tends to increase the melting point through strong dipole-dipole attraction and possible linear interaction with other molecules, we can estimate this increase to be around +80\u00b0C. Each nitro (NO2) group is highly electron-withdrawing and introduces more intermolecular attraction through dipole-dipole interactions, not to mention the possible formation of hydrogen bonds with other molecules, so we can add approximately +40\u00b0C per nitro group. There are two nitro groups, which implies an accumulative increase of around 80\u00b0C above the contribution of the nitrile group. Therefore, adding all these contributions to the base value of benzene gives us the predicted melting point.",

        "Reason": "The basic structure of 2,6-dinitrobenzonitrile is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitrile (C#N) group increases the melting point due to strong dipole-dipole attractions and possible cyano stacking interactions, contributing an estimated increase of about +80\u00b0C. Each nitro (NO2) group is an electron-withdrawing group that can significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to participate in intermolecular attractions such as dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding. We can estimate each nitro group to contribute an increase of about +30\u00b0C. With two nitro groups, the total increase would be approximately +60\u00b0C. Combining these effects gives us an overall prediction for the melting point.",
