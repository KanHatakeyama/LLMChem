The effects of the substituents can be considered as follows: \n- Cyclobutyl group: +20\u00b0C (due to increased molecular weight and hydrophobic character, leading to stronger Van der Waals forces).\n- Phenyl group: +15\u00b0C (due to the introduction of aromatic character and potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, further increasing intermolecular forces).\nAdding the effects of both groups to the base structure's melting point gives an approximate predicted value.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit to consider is hydantoin, which has a melting point of around 220\u00b0C. The substituents affect the melting point as follows: the cyclobutyl group adds significant steric bulk and hydrophobic character, which would typically increase the melting point by enhancing Van der Waals interactions. However, the increase will not be as large as +20\u00b0C since the ring is relatively small and less flexible compared to larger alkyl groups, so we assign it a smaller increment of around +10\u00b0C. The phenyl group contributes to the melting point through \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and an increase in the molecular surface area, which enhances intermolecular forces. This effect can be quantified as a +5\u00b0C increase. Combining these increments with the base structure's melting point gives an approximate predicted value.",
