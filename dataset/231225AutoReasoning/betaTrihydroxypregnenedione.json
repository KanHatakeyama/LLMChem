        "Reason": "The target compound, also known as hydrocortisone, has a basic pregnane steroid structure which itself is derived from cholestane. Cholestane has reported melting point of around 80-100 degrees Celsius. The introduction of functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH) and ketone (=O) groups generally increases the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds which require additional energy to break.\n\nFor each hydroxyl group, the increase in melting point could be estimated at around +20 due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. With three hydroxyl groups present, this would contribute to an increase of approximately +60.\n\nThe ketone groups, with one at C3 and one at C20, can also form hydrogen bonds and may contribute similarly to the melting point. Since these groups are conjugated with the steroid framework, they would individually contribute less than a free hydroxyl group. We can estimate an increase of around +15 for each ketone group, accumulating to +30.\n\nAdding these increments to the estimated base value of cholestane, the prediction for the melting point of hydrocortisone would be:\nBase value (cholestane): 90 (average of the range)\nHydroxyl groups: +60 (3 groups)\nKetone groups: +30 (2 groups)\nPredominant steroidal structure and molecular complexity would further affect the melting point, potentially adding another +40 due to increased molecular rigidity and intermolecular interactions.\n\nThe cumulative estimation would thus be 220 degrees Celsius.",
