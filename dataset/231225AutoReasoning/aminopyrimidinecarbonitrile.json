        "Reason": "The basic unit pyrimidine has a melting point of 22\u00b0C. The amino group (-NH2) is expected to increase the melting point due to the capability of forming hydrogen bonds, possibly up to +100\u00b0C. The cyano group (-C#N) is highly electronegative and can also engage in dipole interactions, contributing to an additional +100\u00b0C increase. Considering that the pyrimidine ring itself has nitrogen atoms that can participate in hydrogen bonding, we can assign an additional increment of +15\u00b0C for the ring nitrogen's effect on the melting point.",

The amino group (-NH2) is expected to increase the melting point due to the capability of forming hydrogen bonds, which could add approximately +100\u00b0C. The cyano group (-C#N) is highly electronegative and can engage in dipole interactions, expected to contribute an additional increase of about +100\u00b0C. However, the presence of nitrogen atoms within the pyrimidine ring which can also partake in hydrogen bonding seems to have been overestimated since the actual value is higher than the predicted one. Adjusting the increment for the ring nitrogen's effect on the melting point to more accurately reflect the actual melting point, we can revise it to +33\u00b0C.",
