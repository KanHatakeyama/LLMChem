        "Reason": "The basic unit, ethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. Each additional methylene group (CH2) in a saturated hydrocarbon chain generally raises the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius because of the increased van der Waals forces. The hydroxyl group (-OH) significantly raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +40 degrees Celsius. So we have the effect of one extra methylene group (+5) and a hydroxyl group (+40) on the base value of ethane.",
