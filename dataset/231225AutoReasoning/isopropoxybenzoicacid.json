        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The isopropoxy group, being a larger and bulkier substituent compared to a methyl group, should increase the melting point significantly due to the increased molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding; an estimated increase of about +100 degrees. The carboxylic acid group forms strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, significantly raising the melting point compared to benzene; this is estimated to contribute an additional +50 degrees. Together, the added effects of these groups would result in a considerable increase in melting point.",
