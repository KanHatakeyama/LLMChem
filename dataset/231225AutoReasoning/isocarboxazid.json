        "Reason": "Considering isocarboxazid's structure, we can break it down to various functional groups and predict the melting point shift accordingly. Starting with a basic phenyl ring (as in benzene), which has an average melting point around 5\u00b0C, we then look at the functional groups attached to it. The phenylhydrazine part of the molecule (C(=O)NNC) can contribute significantly to the melting point due to potential for hydrogen bonding and the dimerization capacity of hydrazides, and might increase it by approximately 40-50\u00b0C. The isonitrile group directly bound to the aromatic ring (no1) is less common, but it generally would increase the melting point due to the presence of a heteroatom (nitrogen) which contributes to intermolecular interactions, so we would add about 30-35\u00b0C. The methyl group attached to the nitrogen (C) has a minor effect but might contribute an increase of around 5-10\u00b0C as it could slightly improve the crystallinity of the compound. Additionally, the presence of another aromatic ring (the benzyl part) also adds to the overall crystallinity and rigidity of the molecule, possibly increasing the melting point by another 5-10\u00b0C. Considering all these effects cumulatively, we can provide an estimation for the melting point.",
