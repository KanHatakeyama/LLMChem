        "Reason": "The basic unit for this structure would be propane, which has a melting point of -187.7 degrees Celsius. Phenyl groups significantly increase the melting point due to the addition of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and increased molecular weight. Each phenyl would increase the melting point considerably. However, because there are two phenyl groups and they are on the same carbon, the symmetry of the molecule can cause an increase in the melting point that may not be exactly additive because of possible intermolecular packing efficiencies. Therefore, although each phenyl could theoretically contribute immensely to the melting point, the combined effect may lead to a more moderate increase. As an estimate, each phenyl group could contribute around +100 degrees Celsius, considering their ability to engage in strong intermolecular interactions and significantly increase the molecular weight of the compound.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for this structure is propane, which has a melting point of -187.7 degrees Celsius. Adding phenyl groups to this structure introduces \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and significantly increases the molecular weight, both of which contribute to an increase in melting point. Each phenyl group also adds rigidity to the molecular structure, further raising the melting point. The two phenyl groups together can have a synergistic effect due to molecular symmetry, which might influence how molecules pack in the solid state, potentially leading to an even higher increase in melting point. However, this effect is not strictly additive as molecular packing can become more efficient with symmetry. A reasonable estimate for the effect of each phenyl group could be around +108 degrees Celsius to the melting point of propane.",
