        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a sulfonamide group greatly increases the melting point due to the introduction of strong intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can be estimated as +110\u00b0C. The bromo group also increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated as +30\u00b0C. The methyl group makes the molecule slightly bulkier, which can increase the melting point, estimated as +5\u00b0C.",
