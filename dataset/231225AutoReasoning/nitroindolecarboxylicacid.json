        "Reason": "The basic unit indole has an estimated melting point in the range of 52\u00b0C. Adding a nitro group increases the melting point due to the introduction of a strong electron-withdrawing group that can form additional intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding with the NH or OH groups of adjacent molecules (+80). Carboxylic acid groups are known to raise the melting point significantly because they can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds (+130). Thus, the presence of both a nitro and a carboxylic acid group in the compound would have a cumulative effect.",
