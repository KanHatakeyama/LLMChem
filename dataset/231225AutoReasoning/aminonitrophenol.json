        "Reason": "The compound 4-amino-3-nitrophenol has several functional groups that will influence its melting point. The base unit of the compound is phenol, which has a melting point of around 41 degrees Celsius. The presence of an amino group (-NH2) typically increases the melting point due to the introduction of hydrogen bonding, which is a strong intermolecular force. We can estimate this increase at about +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the nitro group (-NO2) is an electron-withdrawing group, which can also increase melting point due to the stabilization of the compound and additional intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole interactions. We can estimate this contribution to be around +60 degrees Celsius. There is also a hydroxyl group (-OH) already included in the base phenol unit whose effect has been considered in the base melting point. The overall predicted melting point is the sum of the contributions from the base unit and the functional groups.",
        "Prediction": "41 (phenol base unit) + 50 (amino group contribution) + 60 (nitro group contribution) = 151 degrees Celsius",
