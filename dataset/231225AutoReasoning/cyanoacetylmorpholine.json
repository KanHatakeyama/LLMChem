        "Reason": "The target compound, 4-(cyanoacetyl)morpholine, can be broken down into individual functional group contributions to predict its melting point. The base structure can be considered as morpholine, which has a melting point of -5 degrees Celsius. Adding a cyano group (nitrile) typically raises the melting point by approximately 40 to 80 degrees due to the increase in polarity and possible dipole-dipole interactions. The acetyl group (ketone) typically increases the melting point by approximately 20 to 50 degrees due to the dipole associated with the carbonyl and the increase in molecular weight. The combination of these effects should provide an estimate for the melting point of the target compound.",
        "Prediction": "The base structure, morpholine, contributes -5. Adding the cyano group introduces +60 (as an average increase contribution) and the acetyl group adds another +35 (as a midpoint of the provided range). Summing these values gives us an estimated melting point of 90 degrees Celsius, which is close to the actual value of 87 degrees Celsius.",
