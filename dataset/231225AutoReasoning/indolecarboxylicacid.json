        "Reason": "Indole-2-carboxylic acid consists of an indole core with a carboxylic acid substitution. Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, we add the effects of various functionalities. The indole structure, which is fused with a pyrrole ring, would raise the melting point significantly due to the rigid and planar structure contributing to strong pi-pi stacking interactions; this could add approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid group can form strong hydrogen bonds, further raising the melting point; let's estimate about +100 degrees Celsius for that functionality. Summing these adjustments, we would predict a melting point increase relative to benzene.",
