        "Reason": "The target compound N,N-diethylbenzamide consists of a benzamide base with two ethyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom. Benzamide itself has a melting point around 130\u00b0C. The introduction of N,N-diethyl groups has a significant influence on the melting point due to increased steric hindrance and decreased ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which is essential for higher melting points. Each ethyl group is expected to lower the melting point as follows: Ethyl group: -50 (due to increased steric hindrance and reduced hydrogen bonding capability). Therefore, the addition of two ethyl groups would lead to: 2 x (-50) = -100\u00b0C shift from the benzamide base melting point.",
