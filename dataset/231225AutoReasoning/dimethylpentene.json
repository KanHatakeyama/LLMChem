        "Reason": "The molecule 2,4-dimethyl-2-pentene consists of a five-carbon chain with two double bonds at the 2nd and 4th positions. In comparison to alkanes, alkenes generally have lower melting points due to the reduced van der Waals forces since they are less 'spherical' in shape. The presence of methyl groups slightly increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and size, which can increase the van der Waals interactions between molecules. However, the branching of the methyl groups also tends to decrease the melting point because it prevents the molecules from packing closely together in a solid lattice structure. For an unbranched pentene, we might expect a melting point near that of 1-pentene, which has a melting point of -138.4 \u00b0C. Adding two methyl groups to this base molecule might increase the melting point by several degrees each, but the molecule is also highly branched, which counters this effect and probably reduces the melting point to a comparable or even lower value than 1-pentene. Let's predict that each methyl group adds around +5 \u00b0C but the branching brings it down by -10 \u00b0C. Hence the net effect per methyl group is about -5 \u00b0C.",
