        "Reason": "The base unit to consider for 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diethyl ester is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of carboxylic acid ester groups (two ester groups in this case) usually increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. However, in the case of esters compared to acids, the ability to form hydrogen bonds is decreased because the -OH is replaced with an -OR group, which lowers the melting point relative to the acid. Each ester group being bulky may increase the melting point by about 20 to 30\u00b0C due to added molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. However, the molecule is highly symmetrical, which often facilitates close packing in the solid state and can raise the melting point significantly. Therefore, the increase in the melting point due to the ester groups might be slightly offset by the symmetry of the molecule. Considering these effects, the melting point is increased by approximately 25\u00b0C for each ester group.",

        "Reason": "The base unit to consider for 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diethyl ester is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The two ester groups in the structure would generally increase the melting point due to the added molecular weight and the increased van der Waals forces from the larger size. Each ester group being bulky may increase the melting point by about 3-5\u00b0C. The high symmetry of the molecule tends to facilitate closer molecular packing, which usually increases the melting point. However, esters are not capable of hydrogen bonding as strongly as carboxylic acids, which slightly moderates the increase. Therefore, the melting point increase is adjusted to a smaller value given the balance of these factors.",
