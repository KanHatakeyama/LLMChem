The hydroxyl group typically increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, contributing approximately +100 degrees Celsius. The methyl group generally increases the melting point owing to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, contributing approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Combining these effects, the expected increase in the melting point is +120 degrees Celsius.",
