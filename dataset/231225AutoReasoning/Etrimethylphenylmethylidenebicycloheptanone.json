            "Trimethyl groups": "+15 (three methyl groups add steric bulk and improve crystallinity, but as they are not providing additional hydrogen bonding, their contribution is less than that of functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding)",
            "Additional double bond": "+6 (the presence of a double bond in the conformation restricts rotation and increases the melting point slightly due to greater rigidity)",
            "Molecular symmetry": "+5 (the molecular symmetry may facilitate better packing in the solid state)"
