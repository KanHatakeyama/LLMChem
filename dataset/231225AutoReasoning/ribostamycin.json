        "Reason": "Ribostamycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, consisting of multiple sugar rings, hydroxyl groups, and amino groups. Melting point prediction for complex molecules like ribostamycin requires considering the number of hydrogen-bonding groups and the molecule's overall stability and rigidity.\n\n- Basic unit (glycosidic structure): Since there's no simple analogous compound to ribostamycin that we can use as a baseline, we must consider the scaffold of multiple sugar rings as a starting point. These glycosidic linkages generally give the molecule a higher melting point because of the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds they form. Let's estimate the value for this structure at around 140\u00b0C.\n\n- Hydroxyl groups: Each hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point. Ribostamycin has multiple hydroxyl groups. An approximate increase in melting point for each hydroxyl group should be around +5\u00b0C. Ribostamycin has 9 hydroxyl groups, which, collectively, could add approximately +45\u00b0C to the melting point.\n\n- Amino groups: Similar to hydroxyl groups, amino groups also form hydrogen bonds, further increasing the melting point. The amino groups in ribostamycin contribute to its water solubility and stability through hydrogen bonding. Assuming each amino group increases the melting point by approximately +3\u00b0C and ribostamycin features 3 amino groups, this would total an increase of about +9\u00b0C.\n\nSumming these adjustments, we predict a melting point of around 140 + 45 + 9 = 194\u00b0C for ribostamycin.",
