        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is naphthalene, which has a melting point of around 80 degrees Celsius. The presence of two bromine atoms in the 2,6-positions of the naphthalene significantly affects the melting point. Each bromine atom, being a heavy substituent with a considerable atomic mass, contributes to an increase in the intermolecular van der Waals forces, thereby raising the melting point. A single bromine atom can raise the melting point by roughly 40 degrees Celsius given its effect on similar aromatic compounds. Therefore, the contribution of two bromine atoms is expected to be additive, resulting in an increase of 80 degrees Celsius.",
