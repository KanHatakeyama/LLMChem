        "Reason": "The basic unit for the target compound, fluorenone, has a known melting point of about 82-83 degrees Celsius. The introduction of bromine atoms will significantly raise the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the polarizability of bromine, contributing to stronger intermolecular van der Waals forces. Each bromine is expected to add significantly to the melting point, and based on similar compounds, the addition can be estimated to be around +60 degrees Celsius per bromine atom. The molecular symmetry does not change significantly with the substitution of bromine atoms in the fluorenone structure, maintaining a similar crystal packing efficiency.",
