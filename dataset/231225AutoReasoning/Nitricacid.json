        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be water (H2O), which has a melting point of 0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group (NO2) in nitric acid stabilizes the molecule through resonance and electronegativity differences, which can decrease the melting point due to the alterations in intermolecular forces. However, the increased molecular weight and presence of hydrogen bonding could have increasing effects on the melting point. The nitro group is a significant contributor due to its highly polar nature, but it's important to quantify its effects. Given that the structures and hydrogen-bonding capabilities are similar between water and HNO3, but the nitro group adds significant polarity and resonance stabilization, I estimate that this could decrease the melting point by about 40 to 50 degrees Celsius compared to water.",
