        "Reason": "The basic unit for consideration here is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The compound has several -O- (ether) groups, which tend to lower the melting point slightly compared to a hydrocarbon chain because of lessened van der Waals forces, but the hydroxyl (-OH) groups contribute to hydrogen bonding, which significantly raises the melting point. As we have four -OH groups, this effect is amplified. Ether linkage: -20\u00b0C (each) because they make the molecule more rigid and less compact, but this is offset by hydrogen bonding. Hydroxyl group: +60\u00b0C (each) due to strong hydrogen bonding between molecules.",
