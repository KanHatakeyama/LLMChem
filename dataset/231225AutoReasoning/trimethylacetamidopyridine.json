        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of around -42\u00b0C which serves as our starting point. The presence of an amide functional group (acetamido) usually raises the melting point due to the ability of the nitrogen to participate in hydrogen bonding: +70\u00b0C. The introduction of three methyl groups as part of a tertiary butyl structure (2,2,2-trimethyl) generally increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular size and van der Waals forces: +50\u00b0C each for the first two methyl groups and +20\u00b0C for the steric hindrance of the third one being less effective due to diminishing returns in hindrance and van der Waals forces. Even though each methyl group does not contribute equally, for predictive ease, a rounded average effect per methyl group is considered.",
