        "Reason": "The target compound, 2-(p-hydroxyphenylazo)benzoic acid, can be analyzed by considering the basic units and the impact of the various functional groups present in its structure:\n\n- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of approximately 5.5\u00b0C.\n- Carboxylic acid group: Typically, this group increases the melting point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dimer formation, which can contribute an increase of about 100\u00b0C.\n- Azo group (N=N): Introduces rigidity to the molecule and may raise the melting point due to increased molecular symmetry, adding roughly 40\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C.\n- Hydroxyl groups (p-OH): These groups can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, further increasing the melting point. Two p-OH groups could add approximately 2*(20\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C) due to hydrogen bonding and contribution to molecular symmetry.\n\nAdding the contributions from the basic benzene rings and all functionalities together should allow us to predict the melting point.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point of 2-(p-hydroxyphenylazo)benzoic acid is approximately 5.5 (basic benzene ring) + 100 (carboxylic acid group) + 45 (estimated mid-point for azo group) + 2*30 (mid-point for two hydroxyl groups) = 5.5 + 100 + 45 + 60 = 210.5\u00b0C.",
