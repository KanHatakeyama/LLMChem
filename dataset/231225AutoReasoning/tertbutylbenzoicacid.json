        "Reason": "The base unit for comparison is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius. Adding a tert-butyl group, which is a bulky substituent, will increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance which can enhance the crystal packing efficiency. The tert-butyl group is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately 40-45 degrees Celsius.",
