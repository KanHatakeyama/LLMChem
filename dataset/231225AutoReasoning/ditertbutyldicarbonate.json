        "Reason": "The molecule di-tert-butyl dicarbonate consists of a central dicarbonate group that is bound to two tert-butyl groups. The tert-butyl groups are large and bulky, providing steric hindrance which disrupts the crystal lattice, leading to a lower melting point. Additionally, carbonates often have strong intermolecular forces due to their potential for hydrogen bonding and dipolar interactions. In this case, the tert-butyl groups may interfere with these interactions. - Central carbonate group: -5 (estimate for disrupting crystal packing compared to more symmetrical carbonates) - Each tert-butyl group: -20 (the large size adds steric hindrance which lowers melting point, two such groups would amplify the effect) - Basic unit (dimethyl carbonate), which has a relatively high melting point due to stronger polar interactions: 2 to 4 (but the extreme bulkiness of the tert-butyl groups greatly reduces this effect, therefore providing a negligible impact)",

        "Reason": "The di-tert-butyl dicarbonate molecule has two very bulky tert-butyl groups that add significant steric hindrance, which can disrupt the regular packing of molecules in a crystal and result in a lower melting point. The functionality of a central carbonate group normally contributes to higher melting points due to the potential for stronger intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding. However, the bulkiness of the tert-butyl groups likely impedes close packing and strong intermolecular interactions, diminishing this effect.",

        "Reason": "The compound di-tert-butyl dicarbonate consists of two tert-butyl groups, a carbonate group, and two ester linkages. Starting with a simple hydrocarbon such as butane (melting point -138.3 \u00b0C), we consider the effects of the functional groups. Each tert-butyl group, being bulky, increases the melting point significantly due to increased van der Waals interactions, which can be estimated as +80 \u00b0C per tert-butyl group. The central carbonate moiety contributes to a higher degree of rigidity and stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole interactions; we can approximate its effect as +60 \u00b0C. The ester linkages, which can participate in dipole-dipole interactions are less significant but still may contribute; an estimate would be +15 \u00b0C. However, the ester groups' contribution might be mitigated by the tert-butyl groups' steric hindrance which can prevent optimal packing, so their effect could potentially be less than the raw contribution of ester groups in simpler molecules.",
