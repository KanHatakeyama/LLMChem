        "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is propane, which has a melting point of -187.7 degrees Celsius. Adding fluorine atoms generally increases the melting point due to the increased polarity and the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond. Each fluorine could be estimated to raise the melting point. For the first fluoro substituent on propane, we might estimate an increase of approximately +35 degrees due to enhanced dipole moments and van der Waals forces. The addition of the second fluorine in 2,2-difluoropropane should also increase the melting point, but not by the same magnitude as the first due to the presence of a fluorine already influencing the molecular structure; the second fluorine's effect might be slightly less, at around +30 degrees. Thus, the total estimated increase is +65 degrees Celsius.",

Adding fluorine atoms generally increases the melting point due to increased polarity and the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond, which leads to stronger intermolecular forces. Each fluorine is estimated to raise the melting point. For the first fluorine substituent on propane, we might estimate an increase of approximately +42 degrees due to enhanced dipole moments and van der Waals forces. Given the symmetry of 2,2-difluoro- configuration, the second fluorine would likely have a similar effect as the first. Taking this into account, the second fluorine's effect is estimated to be an additional +42 degrees. Thus, the total estimated increase is +84 degrees Celsius.",
