        "Reason": "- Basic unit, pyridine has a melting point of -42 degrees Celsius. - Methyl group: +51 degrees Celsius (due to larger molecular weight, slightly increases hydrophobicity which might increase van der Waals interactions). - Aldehyde group: -20 degrees Celsius (the polar carbonyl group allows for stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, but slightly hampers crystalline packing due to steric hindrance, and the result is a slightly lower increase than expected). - Overall, the larger molecular weight is the major contributing factor for the increase in the melting point, followed by the effects of the functional groups on the molecular interactions. However, the presence of the nitrogen in the ring also impacts the electronic distribution and slightly lowers the melting point from what would be expected by just considering the functional groups. Therefore, the analisys leads to a moderate increase in melting point over pyridine.",
