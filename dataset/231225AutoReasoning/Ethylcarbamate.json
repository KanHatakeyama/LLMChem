        "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be methane, with a melting point of -182.5 degrees Celsius. The amine functional group (-NH2) generally increases the melting point due to the introduction of hydrogen bonding interactions, which could be estimated at +100 degrees. The carbonyl group (C=O) also increases the melting point due to its polarity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, adding another +80 degrees. The ethoxy group (-OCC) should raise the melting point further due to increased molecular weight and size, as well as the possibility of weak dipole interactions, which gives a smaller increase of about +50 degrees. Combining these changes sequentially to the base melting point of methane gives an approximate calculation.",
