        "Reason": "The base molecule for methyl valerate, pentane, has a melting point of -130 degrees Celsius. The ester functional group (from valeric acid and methanol) generally increases the melting point due to the presence of polar carbonyl (C=O) and alkoxy (O-C) groups, which create dipole-dipole interactions. The ester group in methyl valerate can be predicted to raise the melting point by approximately 40 degrees. However, this compound still has a relatively small molecular weight and a largely non-polar carbon chain that reduces the potential for intermolecular interaction, which generally leads to a lower melting point than more polar compounds of a similar size.",
