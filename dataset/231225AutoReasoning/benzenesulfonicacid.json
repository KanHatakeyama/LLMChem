        "Reason": "The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a sulfonic acid group, which is highly polar and capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, significantly increases the melting point. Additionally, the sulfonic acid group adds two dimensions of effects: the increase in molecular weight and the highly electronegative oxygen atoms, which can engage in dipole-dipole interactions. It is expected that the sulfonic acid group would add significantly to the melting point, we can estimate an addition of approximately 50\u00b0C due to these factors.",

The presence of a sulfonic acid group, which is highly polar and capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, significantly increases the melting point. The sulfonic acid group influences the melting point in two ways: an increase in molecular weight, which usually leads to an increase in melting point due to greater London dispersion forces, and the presence of highly electronegative oxygen atoms, which can engage in strong dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding with other molecules. However, the estimated addition of approximately 50\u00b0C due to these factors appears to be overestimated considering the actual value is 56.5\u00b0C. A more conservative estimate of increase is needed. Taking into account these combined effects, an addition of around 40\u00b0C to the benzene's melting point seems more aligned with the observed value.",

The addition of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) introduces strong polar character and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, both of which significantly raise the melting point. The presence of this functional group with its three oxygen atoms can be expected to add substantially to the melting point, perhaps by around 50 degrees Celsius due to these strong intermolecular forces.",
