        "Reason": "The basic unit for 2,6-octadiene can be considered as ethene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. Each additional methylene (-CH2-) group in a non-branched alkane typically raises the melting point by about +2\u00b0C. 2,6-octadiene has six more -CH2- groups than ethene. Additionally, each double bond tends to lower the melting point because it restricts the free rotation making the molecule less able to pack efficiently in the solid phase. However, since the molecule is non-linear and already has a low melting point, the effect of the additional double bonds beyond the first one will be minimal. For this prediction, we consider only a small decrease due to the double bonds beyond the first. The first double bond in 2,6-octadiene lowers the melting point substantially, so we estimate this reduction to be -30\u00b0C. The additional double bond will be approximated with a -5\u00b0C decrease to account for its minimal effect in this unsaturated hydrocarbon.",
