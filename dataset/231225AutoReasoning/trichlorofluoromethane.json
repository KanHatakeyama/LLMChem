The chlorines introduce both a significant increase in molecular weight and increased intermolecular forces due to their polarizability, which would increase the boiling point. Each chlorine in a chloromethane compound contributes approximately +30; however, this is not linear, and the effect diminishes with substitution due to steric hindrance, so the third chlorine may not add as much. The fluorine atom is smaller than chlorine, but it is highly electronegative, which slightly increases the boiling point but less so than a chlorine atom. So for the first and second chlorine, we add +30 each, for the third chlorine due to diminishing effect we add +20, and for the fluorine, we add +5.",

        "Reason": "Our target compound, trichlorofluoromethane has a basic structure of methane which has a melting point of -182.5\u00b0C. The introduction of halogen atoms typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals forces. Each chlorine atom adds significantly to the molecular weight and also increases polarity. We can estimate the influence of each Cl to be about +20\u00b0C to the melting point, and the one F atom to be about +5\u00b0C, given that it is less massive and less polarizing than Cl but still adds to the molecular weight and polarity. Therefore, the addition of three chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom are predicted to increase the melting point significantly from the base value for methane.",
