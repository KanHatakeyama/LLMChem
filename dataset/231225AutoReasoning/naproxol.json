        "Reason": "The target compound naproxol has two primary functional groups affecting its melting point: the aromatic rings and the ether linkages. Starting with the basic unit, benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The addition of ether linkages usually raises the melting point as it increases the polarity of the molecule, but the exact value can vary significantly depending on the structure. In this case, we can estimate a moderate increase of around +20 degrees Celsius for each of the two ether linkages due to the additional possibility for dipole-dipole interactions. Additionally, the interaction between the two aromatic rings (biphenyl structure) may raise the melting point due to the increased planarity and stacking potential of the molecule, we can estimate an increase of about +30 degrees Celsius. The combined structure with fused rings also contributes to planarity and rigidity, increasing intermolecular interaction, which we can approximate at an additional +10 degrees Celsius. Combining these effects gives us an estimated total increase of +80 degrees Celsius from the base melting point of benzene.",
