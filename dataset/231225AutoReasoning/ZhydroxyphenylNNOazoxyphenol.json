        "Reason": "The target compound has two main functional groups that will affect its melting point: phenol groups and an azoxy linkage. Starting with the basic benzene unit, which has a melting point around 5.5 degrees Celsius, each functional group will contribute as follows:\n- Phenol group: +60 degrees Celsius per group. The presence of a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which makes the compound more rigid, requiring more energy to break the bonds and transition into a liquid state. There are two phenol groups in the molecule.\n- Azoxy linkage: +55 degrees Celsius. The azoxy group has a resonance-stabilized structure, which increases the rigidity of the molecule and provides more intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions that need to be overcome to melt the compound.\nThe effects are additive because the functional groups do not interact in a way that would otherwise affect the melting point significantly.\nPrediction calculation: 5.5 (benzene) + 2 * 60 (phenol groups) + 55 (azoxy linkage) = 180.5 degrees Celsius.",
