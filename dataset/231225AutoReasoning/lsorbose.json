        "Reason": "L-sorbose is a sugar molecule with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, an aldehyde group, and an internal ketone group. Each of these functional groups contribute to the melting point as follows:\n- Hydroxyl groups: Each -OH group forms hydrogen bonds, which typically increase the melting point. There are 4 -OH groups that do not participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, providing a rough estimate increase of +20\u00b0C each for extensive hydrogen bonding.\n- Aldehyde group: Provides polarity but with less hydrogen bonding capacity than an alcohol, estimating at +10\u00b0C.\n- Internal ketone group: The ketone is less polar than an aldehyde and contributes less to hydrogen bonding compared to -OH groups, giving an estimated increase of +5\u00b0C.\n- Starting with a basic monosaccharide structure (such as glucose) which has a melting point of approximately 146\u00b0C, the effects of these groups can be added:\n146 (monosaccharide base) + 4(20) (hydroxyl groups) + 10 (aldehyde) + 5 (ketone) = 146 + 80 + 10 + 5.",

        "Reason": "L-sorbose is a sugar molecule with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, an aldehyde group, and an internal ketone group. Each of these functional groups contribute differently to the melting point. Hydroxyl groups contribute to extensive hydrogen bonding; however, due to steric hindrance and intramolecular interactions, not all hydroxyls contribute equally. A slight increase of +5\u00b0C per freely interacting -OH group is estimated. The aldehyde group contributes to polarity, estimating an increase of +5\u00b0C. The internal ketone group contributes less to hydrogen bonding than the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups, with a minor increase estimated at +2\u00b0C. Starting from the monosaccharide base structure like glucose, with a melting point of approximately 146\u00b0C, the predicted adjustments would be: 146 (base) + 4(5) (four hydroxyl groups) + 5 (aldehyde) + 2 (ketone) = 146 + 20 + 5 + 2.",
