        "Reason": "The compound butyl benzoate consists of a benzoate ester with a butyl group attached to it. The basic unit for this compound is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius due to the ability of the carboxylic acid group to engage in strong hydrogen bonding, increasing intermolecular forces. The functional group changes to consider are: the ester group (-COO-) replacing the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group and the addition of a butyl group. The ester group reduces the potential for hydrogen bonding compared to carboxylic acids, which generally lowers the melting point by about 40 to 50 degrees. Addition of the butyl group increases the molecular weight and size of the molecule, slightly increasing the van der Waals forces and could raise the melting point, but to a much lesser extent, potentially by about 5 degrees.",

        "Reason": "The compound butyl benzoate consists of a benzoate ester connected with a butyl group to the benzene ring. The base structure, benzoic acid, has a melting point of 122 C. The conversion to an ester generally reduces the melting point due to the loss of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that carboxylic acids exhibit, decreasing the melting point substantially, typically by 40 to 50 degrees Celsius. The butyl group adds to the molecular weight and increases the van der Waals interactions. However, this effect is modest in comparison to the loss of hydrogen bonding, and it can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately 5 degrees. Thus, the two primary structural changes will have competing effects on the melting point.",

        "Reason": "The target compound butyl benzoate consists of the benzene ring as a base unit and the butyl ester group. The base unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The ester functional group generally lowers the melting point relative to benzene because of a reduction in polarizability and associated van der Waals forces as compared to a similar-sized alkyl chain. Benzene's high symmetry and pi-stacking ability often lead to higher melting points compared to its derivatives. We estimate the butyl group has a slight effect on decreasing the melting point further because it is a bulky non-polar group that reduces the overall symmetry and can disrupt crystal packing. Ester (-O-CO-) linkage has a greater impact due to the presence of a polar carbonyl group, but in the case of esters bonded to aromatic rings, the decreased crystallinity generally prevails. Overall, the combination of these effects leads to a decrease in melting point. Estimated decrease due to ester group: -15, due to butyl group: -3.",
