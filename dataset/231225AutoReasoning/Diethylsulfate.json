        "Reason": "Diethyl sulfate has a molecular structure that includes a sulfate group (SO4) and two ethyl groups (CH2CH3), linked via oxygen atoms. We will consider the effects of these groups on the melting point: \n- Sulfate group: This is a highly polar group that can form strong dipole-dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonds with water. Polar groups tend to increase the melting point. Let's estimate this increment to be +80.\n- Ethyl groups: These are nonpolar and add hydrophobic character to the molecule. Alkyl chains tend to lower the melting point as they interfere with crystal lattice formation and increase molecular volume, which decreases the lattice energy. Let's estimate this decrement for each ethyl group to be -30. Since there are two ethyl groups, we have a total reduction of -60.\n- Ether oxygen linkage: The oxygen atoms in the ether linkages may allow for some polarity and possibilities for hydrogen bonding, albeit weaker than the sulfate group. For each ether linkage, we can estimate a slight increase of +10. With two ether linkages total, this would add +20.\n\nConsidering benzene as the base molecule for aromatic compounds isn't directly applicable here since diethyl sulfate is aliphatic and contains no aromatic rings. A better base molecule for comparing sulfur-containing compounds might be dimethyl sulfate, but since we do not have a reference value for dimethyl sulfate's melting point, we cannot use it for comparison. Therefore, our starting reference point will be zero, and we will only consider the specific functional groups' contributions discussed above.",
