        "Reason": "The compound 4-chloro-3-fluorobenzonitrile includes a benzene ring as its core structure, which typically has a melting point around 5.5 \u00b0C (benzene). The nitrile group (-C\u2261N) tends to increase melting points due to its polarity and potential for strong dipole-dipole interactions and cyano group ring interaction; the increment can be estimated (+40). Fluorine being highly electronegative and small adds to the dipole moment and has potential for strong dipole-dipole interactions; however, since it's a small atom, the increase in melting point is modest (+10). Chlorine is a larger halogen than fluorine and contributes to increased dispersion forces as well as possible dipolar interactions, leading to a greater increment than fluorine in the melting point (+20). However, since these groups are positionally separated on the ring, there might be less synergistic effect than if they were adjacent. The influence of the substituents is additive.",
