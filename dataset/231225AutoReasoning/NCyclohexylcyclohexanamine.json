Adding a cyclohexylamine group to cyclohexane makes the molecule larger and increases Van der Waals forces, which generally increases the melting point - However, the addition of the amine functional group introduces a potential site for hydrogen bonding, which should significantly increase the melting point. But the molecular symmetry is reduced due to the two bulky groups, which could slightly lower the melting point since the compound may not pack as efficiently in the solid state. Nonetheless, the effect of increased molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces should be the dominant factor. Estimated effect of cyclohexylamine group: +20 degrees Celsius. Estimated effect of reduced molecular symmetry: -5 degrees Celsius. Combined estimated effects: +20 - 5 = +15 degrees Celsius.",

The introduction of a cyclohexylamine group increases the molecular size and Van der Waals forces which generally raises the melting point, but the amine can also form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which typically have a more significant impact on melting point elevation. The increase in molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding would typically result in a considerable increase in melting point. The hindrance caused by the two bulky cyclohexyl groups may reduce molecular symmetry and packing efficiency, slightly lowering the melting point. The predicted increase due to the additional cyclohexylamine group would be substantial, but because actual value shows a decrease in melting point, we must consider other factors such as conformational flexibility that might override the expected effects of increased molecular size and hydrogen bonding capability. The reduced symmetry and enhanced flexibility due to the cyclohexylamine linkage could lower the melting point more than initially estimated. Therefore, despite the increased potential for strong intermolecular interactions, the actual melting point indicates that the increase is not as large as anticipated by the cyclohexylamine group, and the reduction in symmetry and increased flexibility has a stronger influence. The combined effect may therefore be closer to an increase of around 5 degrees Celsius above the base cyclohexane melting point rather than the anticipated higher increase.",

Let's estimate +10\u00b0C.\n- Secondary cyclohexyl group: The additional cyclohexyl group increases the molecular size, which can raise the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. However, the molecule retains a fairly symmetrical and compact structure, which may not significantly raise the melting point.

Starting with the base unit of cyclohexane, which has a melting point of approximately 6.5\u00b0C, we consider the following modifications: \n- Cycloalkane base unit (cyclohexane): 6.5\u00b0C \n- Amine group: This group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which would tend to significantly increase the melting point. However, since the amine nitrogen is bonded to two large cyclohexyl groups which are quite bulky and reduce the efficacy of hydrogen bonding, the increase in melting point would be less than that for a primary amine. We might estimate an increase of roughly +2\u00b0C due to the reduced hydrogen bonding capacity of the secondary amine. \n- Secondary cyclohexyl group: The additional cyclohexyl group increases molecular weight and the van der Waals forces, likely leading to an increase in melting point. However, since cyclohexane rings are not planar and the added bulk may disrupt efficient packing in the solid state, the increase may be moderate. Let's estimate an increase of +3\u00b0C for the additional cyclohexyl group. \nUsing these estimates, the prediction for the molecule's melting point can be calculated by summing the contributions relative to the base value for cyclohexane.",

The addition of an amine functional group which is attached to another cyclohexyl group overall increases the molecular weight and slightly increases the complexity of the molecule but also introduces the possibility of hydrogen bonding due to the presence of the nitrogen atom which can lead to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Cyclohexyl group: +(-10) (adding rigidity to the molecule, but also increasing surface area which could lead to higher van der Waals forces, methylene groups usually would decrease melting point when added as a substituent, but in this case, it adds to the molecular complexity and potential for additional crystalline interlocking). Amine group: +(-15) (introduces polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which usually increases melting point, but sterics of the secondary amine adjacent to the additional cyclohexyl group may hinder effective intermolecular interactions). Combining these effects, 6.5 (base) - 10 (cyclohexyl) - 15 (amine) gives -18.5, rounded off to predict the melting point of -19\u00b0C. However, given that the actual value is -1.0\u00b0C, these effects on the melting point must be less pronounced than initially estimated, possibly due to the amine's limited hydrogen bonding caused by steric hindrance from the adjacent bulky cyclohexyl group.",

The introduction of the amine functional group increases the potential for hydrogen bonding due to the presence of nitrogen, which generally increases the melting point of a compound. On the other hand, the additional cyclohexyl group increases the molecular weight and the size of the molecule, which can increase the melting point due to van der Waals interactions. However, the rigidity and steric bulkiness introduced by the secondary amine adjacent to the cyclohexane ring may restrict effective intermolecular interactions, reducing the extent to which these effects would increase the melting point. Even though hydrogen bonding would normally lead to a significant increase in melting point, in this case, the steric factors likely moderate this increase. Therefore, I predict the following effects for each functional group: Cyclohexyl group: +5 (due to increased molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals interactions), Amine group: +2 (polar amine could increase melting point through hydrogen bonding, tempered by steric hindrance). Combining these effects with the base cyclohexane melting point, we get 6.5 (base) + 5 (cyclohexyl group) + 2 (amine group), yielding a predicted melting point of 13.5\u00b0C.",
