        "Reason": "The basic unit for consideration is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The substitution of hydrogen in the benzene ring with halogens such as chlorine and fluorine increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the introduction of stronger intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole forces. Chlorine substitution: +50 (due to larger molecular weight and increased dipole moments). Fluorine substitution: +30 (although smaller than chlorine, fluorine has a significant electronegativity, contributing to increased intermolecular forces). The boronic acid group (B(OH)2) also increases the melting point substantially because of the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the boron\u2019s ability to coordinate with oxygen atoms. This creates a more complex molecular lattice, leading to a higher melting point. The boronic acid group contributes approximately +150 to the melting point.",

Fluorine substitution: +40 (due to the electronegativity and dipole-dipole interactions). The presence of the boronic acid group (B(OH)2) contributes significantly to the melting point due to the ability for hydrogen bonding and dative bonding with the boron atom.
