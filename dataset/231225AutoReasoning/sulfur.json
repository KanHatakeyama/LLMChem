        "Reason": "The basic unit in this case is atomic sulfur, which typically exists as S8 rings in its solid form. Elemental sulfur's crystals are held together by relatively weak van der Waals forces between S8 molecules which determines its melting point. The lack of additional functional groups and the simple molecular structure suggests the melting point is mainly influenced by the molecular interactions between these S8 rings.",
