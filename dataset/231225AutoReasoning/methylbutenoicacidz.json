        "Reason": "The target compound, 2-methyl-2-butenoic acid, contains several functional groups that affect its melting point. Starting with the base structure of butanoic acid, which has a melting point of around -5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methyl group slightly increases the molecular weight and adds some steric hindrance, typically raising the melting point by a few degrees (+3 degrees Celsius). The presence of a double bond (alkene group) in the 2-position generally decreases the melting point compared to a saturated acid due to less effective packing of the molecules (-5 degrees Celsius). Furthermore, the presence of a carboxylic acid group generally increases the melting point because of the capacity of forming strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds (+10 degrees Celsius). Combining these factors, the overall predicted shift in melting point relative to butanoic acid is small.",

        "Reason": "The target compound, 2-methyl-2-butenoic acid, is modified from butanoic acid which has a melting point of around -5 degrees Celsius. The addition of a methyl group typically raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and steric hindrance, which could be expected to increase the melting point by approximately +3 degrees Celsius. The alkene group, which causes less effective molecular packing due to its geometric shape, commonly lowers the melting point by about -5 degrees Celsius. However, the presence of the carboxylic acid group greatly increases the melting point because it allows for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which could increase the melting point by about +50 degrees Celsius. Considering these adjustments, the overall increase would be the sum: -5 (base) +3 (methyl) -5 (alkene) +50 (carboxylic acid) = +43 degrees Celsius.",
