        "Reason": "The basic unit, naphthalene, has a melting point of 80.5\u00b0C. Adding methyl groups to a structure generally increases the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and Van der Waals forces, though the substituted position can affect the magnitude of this change: ortho-substitutions can lead to sterical hindrance, slightly decreasing stability and thus, may not increase the melting point as much as other positions might. In the case of 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene, there are two methyl groups in the molecule, one at the 2nd and another at the 6th position of the naphthalene ring, which also contributes to a more symmetrical structure and could increase the melting point. Considering the effect per methyl group to be approximately +15.75\u00b0C (compared to a methyl group's effect in a simpler aromatic compound such as toluene, which is around +30\u00b0C, but acknowledging a possible decrease due to sterical hindrance and the extended aromatic system), we can estimate the melting point shift for two methyl groups.",
