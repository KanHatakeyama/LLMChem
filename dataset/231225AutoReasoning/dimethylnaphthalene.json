        "Reason": "The basic unit for 1,7-dimethylnaphthalene would be naphthalene. The melting point of naphthalene is 80.2\u00b0C. The addition of methyl groups generally decreases the melting point because they disrupt the regular stacking of the molecules, which weakens the intermolecular forces such as van der Waals forces. Since there are two methyl groups, one at the 1 position and the other at the 7 position of naphthalene, the symmetry of the molecule is slightly disturbed, but steric hindrance is not significantly increased due to the positions being far from each other, so the decrease in melting point is not as drastic as it might be with other substitutions. We can estimate the effect of one methyl group to decrease the melting point by about 40 to 50\u00b0C (based on similar aromatic compounds). Since there are two, we will double this effect.",
