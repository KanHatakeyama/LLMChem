        "Reason": "The target compound, norphenazone, has the following functional groups that influence its melting point: a phenyl group (benzene ring), an amide group, and a diazene group. The basic unit here could be considered as the benzene ring, which has a reference melting point (though for boiling point) of 5.5\u00b0C. Amide groups typically increase the melting point due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding and resonance stability, which can be estimated to add about +80\u00b0C. Diazene groups do not generally have a strong effect on melting point, but let's estimate a small increase of +10\u00b0C due to the potential for molecular rigidity and some degree of polarity. The substituted carbon (a tertiary carbon with two hydrogens replaced by nitrogen) could slightly decrease the symmetry and hence slightly lower the melting point by about -5\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The target compound, norphenazone, consists of a phenyl ring and contains an amide group and a diazene group. These functional groups significantly influence its melting point. The phenyl group serves as the basic unit, with a reference melting point close to that of benzene, which is 5.5\u00b0C. The amide group is expected to raise the melting point due to its capability for hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, an increase that can be roughly quantified as +100\u00b0C. The diazene group, with its N=N double bond, may introduce some rigidity and polarity, which generally contributes to a higher melting point; this effect might add around +20\u00b0C. The tertiary carbon linked to nitrogen atoms may have a minor impact but typically won't drastically alter the melting point. Combining the effects, the predicted melting point is an accumulation of the increments due to each functional group.",
