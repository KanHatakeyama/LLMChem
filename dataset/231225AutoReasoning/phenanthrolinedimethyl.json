        "Reason": "The base structure for this compound is phenanthroline, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups (one at the 2- and the other at the 9-position of the phenanthroline) will increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and a slight increase in the symmetry of the molecule, which might contribute to better molecular packing. Each methyl group can be expected to raise the melting point by approximately 20 to 30 degrees Celsius.",
