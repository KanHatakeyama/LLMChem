Here are the functional group effects considered quantitatively for this prediction:\n- Basic saturated hydrocarbon chain: +30 (due to van der Waals forces)\n- Ester group: +40 (polar and can form dipole-dipole interactions)\n- Multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups: +50 (highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding)\n- Ether group: +5 (slightly polar)\n- Keto groups: +20 (polar)\n- Amino group: +10 (polar and possible hydrogen bond donor)\n- Tetrahydrofuran rings: +15 each (due to ring strain and some polarity)\n- Tetrahydropyran rings: +20 each (due to ring strain and some polarity)\nNote: These values are additive estimates based on the impact of each group on the melting point compared to simple hydrocarbons. They are approximations, as the precise effect of each group can depend on the compound's specific structure and intermolecular forces.",
