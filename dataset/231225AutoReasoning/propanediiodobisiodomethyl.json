        "Reason": "The base structure for the compound is propane, which has a melting point of -188. The introduction of four iodine atoms significantly increases the molecular weight and molecular size, which typically leads to an increase in the melting point due to greater London dispersion forces. Each iodine might add roughly +100 to +110 due to these forces and due to the fact that halogens can lead to stronger intermolecular interactions. Since there are four iodine atoms, this yields an incremental increase of approximately +400 to +440.",
