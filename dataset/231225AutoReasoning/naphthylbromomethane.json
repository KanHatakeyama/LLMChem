        "Reason": "The basic unit for the target compound is naphthalene, which has a melting point of 80.1\u00b0C. Adding a bromomethyl group will affect the melting point in several ways. Firstly, the bromine atom is quite heavy, which might tend to increase the melting point due to a larger molar mass. This could potentially increase the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. However, the presence of a bromomethyl group also adds polarizability but also potentially disrupts the crystalline structure because of steric hindrance, which typically reduces the melting point. The reduction might be around -44\u00b0C, giving prominence to the structural disruption over the molar mass effect.",
