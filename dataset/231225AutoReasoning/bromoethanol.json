        "Reason": "The base unit ethanol has a melting point of -114.1 \u00b0C. Adding a bromine atom will increase this value because bromine adds significant molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. However, the hydroxyl group (-OH) in ethanol is capable of hydrogen bonding, which typically raises the melting point. Since 2-bromoethanol retains the hydroxyl group, the hydrogen bonding persists. Therefore the increase in melting point due to the bromine atom will be somewhat counterbalanced by the existing effect of the hydroxyl group. Relative to hydrogen, bromine's larger atomic size and higher atomic weight tend to increase the melting point by approximately +30 units. Taking all these into consideration, we adjust the base melting point of ethanol upward to reflect the addition of bromine.",
