        "Reason": "The structure of prazepam consists of multiple functional groups that influence its melting point. To begin with, the basic unit we can consider is a biphenyl structure, which typically has a melting point around 70\u00b0C due to its planar structure and strong intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. The biphenyl is also substituted with additional functional groups that affect the melting point. Each chlorine atom typically raises the melting point by about 20\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. The compound has one chlorine atom, so we add 20\u00b0C to our base value. The presence of a diazepine ring, which includes a nitrogen atom connected to a carbonyl group, can raise the melting point due to additional hydrogen-bonding capacity from the nitrogen (estimation: +50\u00b0C), and the carbonyl group can also form hydrogen bonds (+25\u00b0C). Furthermore, a dimethylcyclohexane ring is present, which introduces steric hindrance and reduces the planarity and symmetry of the molecule, potentially lowering the melting point slightly (estimation: -10\u00b0C). Combining these effects, we get an estimated increase of 85\u00b0C over the basic biphenyl structure.",
