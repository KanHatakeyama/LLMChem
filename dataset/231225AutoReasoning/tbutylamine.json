        "Reason": "The base structure of an amine such as ethylamine has a melting point in the range of -81 degrees Celsius. In the case of t-butylamine, the significant steric hindrance and bulkiness of the t-butyl group (tert-butyl) attached to the nitrogen atom will increase the molecule's size, but will have a less pronounced effect on the melting point due to the flexibility and less ordered packing of the molecules. Usually, bulkier groups tend to disrupt crystalline lattice and, thus, can decrease the melting point. However, the presence of the nitrogen should lead to stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding when compared to a purely hydrocarbon t-butyl group, which can slightly increase the melting point. The overall effect of the t-butyl group in comparison to ethylamine may be predicted to slightly increase the melting point of the molecule due to the aforementioned hydrogen bonding. Considering the melting points of similar alkylamines and accounting for the t-butyl group, it is expected to have a melting point slightly higher than ethylamine, but the overall effect of the t-butyl group on melting point is expected to be relatively moderate.",
