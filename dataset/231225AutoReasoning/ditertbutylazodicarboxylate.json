        "Reason": "The target compound, di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate, is composed of several functional groups. Its structure can be dissected as follows: the basic unit we consider is azodicarboxylate, which by comparison to similar azo compounds is expected to have a moderate melting point due to the presence of dinitrogen linkage which introduces rigidity and potential for crystalline packing. Adding two tert-butyl groups increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, likely raising the melting point. Tert-butyl groups are known to increase melting points because of their bulky nature, which can facilitate better crystal lattice packing. We can estimate the increase by tert-butyl groups to be in the range of +20 to +30 degrees Celsius per tert-butyl group. There are two of these groups, which results in a cumulative effect. Additionally, the ester groups in the compound may have a moderate influence on the melting point, possibly raising it slightly due to the polarity they introduce, let's estimate this effect at +5 to +10 degrees. As a starting point, similar azo compounds with less bulky groups might have a melting point in the range of 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. Combining all these effects leads to the predicted melting point.",

        "Reason": "The base structure for di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate is azodicarboxylate; similar azo compounds have an estimated melting point around 50 to 60 degrees Celsius due to the rigidity and crystalline packing potential introduced by the dinitrogen linkage. Each tert-butyl group contributes significantly to the melting point because of increased molecular weight and steric hindrance, which often raises the melting point by about +20 to +30 degrees Celsius due to better crystal lattice packing. Given that there are two tert-butyl groups, this effect is cumulative. Additionally, the ester functional groups contribute a smaller increase estimated between +5 to +10 degrees Celsius due to the polarity, which could strengthen intermolecular interactions. Therefore, we add these effects to the baseline melting point of azodicarboxylate.",

        "Reason": "The basic units for di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate to consider are the tert-butyl groups and the azodicarboxylate moiety. The melting point is based on a combination of factors including molecular size, symmetry, polarity, and hydrogen bonding capabilities. A similar compound to compare with is dimethyl azodicarboxylate (DMAD), which has a melting point closer to -1\u00b0C (272 K). Each tert-butyl group adds steric bulk and reduces the potential for close packing compared to methyl groups, thus, potentially lowering the melting point. However, tert-butyl groups are also larger and can increase the van der Waals interactions. For azodicarboxylate: ester groups typically raise the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions. Azodicarboxylate lacks hydrogen bond donors, which would have provided additional elevation of the melting point. The overall structure is relatively rigid and symmetrical, which would tend to raise the melting point. To estimate the effects, +30 units for each tert-butyl group (compared to methyl) for increased van der Waals interactions, and +20 units for the azodicarboxylate structure due to rigidity and symmetry compared to DMAD. We have two tert-butyl groups, so that's a total of +60 units from tert-butyl, and +20 from the core azodicarboxylate structure.",
