        "Reason": "The basic structure to consider for 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) is ethane, which has a melting point of around -183 degrees Celsius. The thiol groups (\u2013SH) tend to have hydrogen bonding, which will significantly increase the melting point. Two hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) contribute to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point even more. Hydroxyl groups each typically add around +100 degrees Celsius due to strong hydrogen bonding. Thiol groups also stabilize the structure via hydrogen bonding, but less so than hydroxyl groups, adding approximately +40 degrees Celsius each. Moreover, the molecule has a chiral center which increases the structural complexity and can slightly raise the melting point. However, DTT has S-S linkage which may slightly lower the melting point due to less effective packing compared to single S atoms. Overall, the combination of these groups leads to a much higher melting point than the base structure of ethane.",
