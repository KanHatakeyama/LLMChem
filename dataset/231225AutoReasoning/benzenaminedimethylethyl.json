        "Reason": "The basic structure to consider is benzene, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of the amine (NH2) group to benzene generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding can significantly raise the melting point, let's estimate this effect at about +50\u00b0C. However, the 4-tert-butyl (1,1-dimethylethyl) group is large and bulky, leading to steric hindrance that can slightly reduce the melting point due to a decrease in crystal packing efficiency. Let's estimate the effect of the t-butyl group to be -15\u00b0C. Combining these effects, we can predict the melting point of the target compound.",

The 4-tert-butyl (1,1-dimethylethyl) group, however, is large and bulky, which might disrupt crystal packing and slightly lower the melting point. Given that bulky groups can hinder solid packing, let's estimate the effect of the t-butyl group to be quite significant at -40\u00b0C.
