        "Reason": "The basic unit for N,N-dimethylbenzamide is benzamide, which has a melting point of 130\u00b0C due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and its resonance stability. The addition of two methyl groups to the nitrogen atom decreases the melting point. First, methyl groups increase steric hindrance, decreasing the ability to form strong intermolecular interactions. Second, they increase the overall molecular volume and surface area, leading to a decrease in the packing efficiency in the solid state. Lastly, they add a small amount of electron-donating inductive effect, which can slightly destabilize the resonance of the amide bond. The combined effect of the two N-methyl groups would likely reduce the melting point by around 86 \u00b0C.",
