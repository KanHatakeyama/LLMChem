        "Reason": "The compound butyl p-aminobenzoate includes various functional groups that influence its melting point. Starting with benzene as the basic unit, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we need to consider the effects of the substituents. The ester functional group (COO) tends to increase the melting point due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, although in the case of butyl ester, the increase might be moderate because the butyl group is not as polar or capable of strong hydrogen bonding, let's estimate this as a +30\u00b0C increase. The amino group (-NH2) attached to the benzene ring has the potential for hydrogen bonding as well, which can significantly increase the melting point, estimated at +50\u00b0C. The butyl group (C4H9-) is a larger alkyl chain which can increase the van der Waals forces and thus the melting point slightly, let's add +10\u00b0C for this. However, the combined effect of all the substituents might not be additive due to steric effects and the overall molecular shape that can affect the crystal lattice packing. Considering all these factors we get an estimate. However, since the actual melting point is known to be 58.0\u00b0C, the adjustments show that the initial estimations were higher than they should be. Therefore, the moderate impact of the butyl group and a less significant impact of the ester and amino groups in terms of melting point increase should be corrected to match the actual value.",
