        "Reason": "The basic unit here is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Adding a fused three-ring system, like in phenanthrene, significantly increases the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, leading to stronger pi-pi stacking interactions and a higher melting point. The influence of the fused three-ring system on the benzene baseline can be estimated to be around +125 degrees Celsius. The amino group on the other hand, while it introduces the potential for hydrogen bonding, would have a lesser impact due to the already substantial pi-pi interactions and the steric hindrance in the polycyclic system. The effect of an amino group can be estimated at around +7.8 degrees Celsius.",
