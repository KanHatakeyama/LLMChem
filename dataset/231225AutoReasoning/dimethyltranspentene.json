        "Reason": "The basic unit for our consideration will be ethene, which has a melting point of -169\u00b0C. Each methyl (CH3) group attached generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular size and van der Waals forces. In the case of 4,4-dimethyl-trans-2-pentene, we have three additional methyl groups compared to ethene, which we'll estimate to contribute roughly +10\u00b0C each to the melting point. The presence of the trans double bond will have a less pronounced effect on the melting point than a cis double bond due to less steric hindrance, but it may slightly increase the melting point due to more efficient packing in the solid state; we'll roughly estimate this increase to be +5\u00b0C.",
