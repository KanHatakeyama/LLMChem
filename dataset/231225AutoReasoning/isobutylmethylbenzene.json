Each methyl group has an effect of -5\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular symmetry causing a decrease in crystal packing efficiency. The isobutyl group causes a larger decrease because of its bulkier size contributing to a decrease in crystal packing efficiency and increase in molecular volume, estimated at -20\u00b0C.

        "Reason": "The target compound, 1-isobutyl-2-methyl-benzene, is derived from benzene. The benzene ring serves as the basic structural unit with a known melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Isobutyl and methyl substituents are added to the benzene ring. Each alkyl substituent generally decreases the melting point due to an increase in entropy and decrease in symmetry, compared to the highly symmetric benzene. The methyl group, being smaller, has a minor impact on the melting point, estimated at a decrease of -5 \u00b0C. The larger isobutyl group has a more significant effect, causing a further decrease, estimated at -25 \u00b0C, due to its bulkier size and the introduction of increased rotational freedom. Therefore, the combined effect of the isobutyl and methyl groups on the benzene ring is anticipated to be a decrease of -30 \u00b0C (5 from methyl and 25 from isobutyl).",

        "Reason": "To predict the melting point for 1-isobutyl-2-methyl-benzene, we start by considering the basic unit, which is benzene. The melting point of benzene is 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of alkyl groups generally tends to lower the melting point due to bulkiness that interferes with crystal lattice formation. The methyl group generally lowers the melting point by approximately -5 degrees Celsius. An isobutyl group is larger than a methyl group and would have a more pronounced effect on lowering the melting point. It may lower the melting point by an additional -15 degrees Celsius considering its larger size and branching compared to a methyl group. The combined effect of one isobutyl and one methyl substituent on the benzene ring would thus result in a melting point decrease of about -5 (methyl) + -15 (isobutyl) = -20 degrees Celsius from the melting point of benzene.",

        "Reason": "To predict the melting point for 1-isobutyl-2-methyl-benzene, we start with the base unit benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Alkyl groups, like the methyl and isobutyl attached to the benzene ring, generally lower the melting point because they disrupt the regularity of the crystal lattice due to their bulkiness, thus making the solid less stable. A methyl group typically decreases the melting point by about -5 degrees. An isobutyl group, being bulkier and causing more disruption in the crystal packing than a methyl group, might be expected to decrease it by a larger amount, possibly around -20 degrees given its increased size and branching. Combining these effects, the total predicted change in the melting point due to the substituents would be -5 (from methyl) + -20 (from isobutyl), equaling -25 degrees in total. The predicted melting point of 1-isobutyl-2-methyl-benzene would therefore be 5.5 (benzene base) - 25 (combined alkyl groups effect), which is -19.5 degrees Celsius.",
