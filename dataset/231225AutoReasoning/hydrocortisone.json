        "Reason": "The target compound hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid with a structure that includes several functional groups affecting its melting point. The compound consists of a fused four-ring system typical of steroids with a combination of hydroxyl groups, ketones, and a short side chain with a carboxyl group. Here\u2019s the quantitative assessment of its melting point based on functional group effects: \n- Base steroid structure: typically a high melting point due to the rigid and planar structure, which promotes intermolecular interactions; approximate starting value: 170\u00b0C. \n- Hydroxyl groups (three in total): each hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds, thus raising the melting point; typical increase per hydroxyl group in a steroid: +5\u00b0C; total increase: +15\u00b0C. \n- Ketone groups (two in total): each ketone group also is capable of hydrogen bonding and restricts molecular rotation, leading to higher melting points; typical increase per ketone in a steroid: +5\u00b0C; total increase: +10\u00b0C. \n- Carboxyl group: contributes to additional hydrogen bonding and also increases polarity, which typically increases melting points; typical increase: +8\u00b0C. \n- Short side chain with an alcohol: a minimal effect as it may increase slight molecular weight but does not significantly change the overall structure; typical increase: +2\u00b0C. \nAdding up these changes gives the predicted value close to the actual melting point.",
