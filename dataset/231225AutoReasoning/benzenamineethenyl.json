        "Reason": "The basic unit which is benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. An amino (NH2) group generally tends to increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding. However, in the case of aniline (benzenamine), the melting point is actually higher than that of benzene due to the presence of a more polar group attached directly to the ring, which significantly enhances intermolecular interactions. Aniline itself has a melting point of -6\u00b0C. The vinyl group (ethenyl) is less polar than the amino group and generally would not significantly increase the melting point. Here, the combination of the two additional groups, the amino and the ethenyl, have a combined effect that results in a melting point that is intermediate between that of benzene and that of aniline. The vinyl group would likely not contribute much to elevation of the melting point, perhaps slightly stabilizing the molecular structure.",
