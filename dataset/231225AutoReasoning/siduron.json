        "Reason": "The siduron molecule is composed of a benzene ring, cyclohexyl group, urea group, and a secondary amine linked to the aromatic ring. Here's a breakdown of each group's effect on the melting point compared to a basic benzene ring: Benzene ring (base compound): +0; Urea group: +80 (due to high polarity and ability to form strong hydrogen bonds); Cyclohexyl group: +30 (due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces); Secondary amine: +20 (due to moderate polarity and capability of hydrogen bonding).",
