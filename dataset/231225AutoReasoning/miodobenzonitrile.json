        "Reason": "The basic unit for m-iodobenzonitrile is benzene, which has a reference melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. A cyano group (nitrile) is present in the compound, which can increase the melting point due to its ability to accept hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, and contribute to the molecule's linearity, which promotes strong molecular packing; this effect can increase the melting point by approximately 70 degrees Celsius. The iodine substituent also present in this compound is a large, heavy atom that can increase the melting point due to increased London dispersion forces; the effect of an iodine atom can be estimated to raise the melting point by about 20 degrees Celsius. The total estimated increase is the sum of effects from the cyano and iodine groups.",

        "Reason": "The base molecule for m-iodobenzonitrile is benzene, which has a melting point of approximately 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a cyano group (nitrile) is known to significantly increase the melting point because it allows for strong dipole-dipole interactions due to its polarity, and can also take part in hydrogen bonding with potential external donors; this could contribute an estimated increase in melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. On the other hand, the iodine substituent, being a large and heavy halogen atom, would increase the melting point due to enhanced van der Waals (London dispersion) forces; this is estimated to contribute an increase of approximately -5 degrees Celsius, as heavier halogens like iodine can sometimes disrupt the crystalline structure and slightly lower the melting point compared to lighter halogens. Therefore, the cyano group has a strong melting point-raising effect, while the iodine\u2019s effect is relatively smaller and somewhat opposes the overall rise in melting point.",
