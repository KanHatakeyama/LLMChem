        "Reason": "The compound 7-amino-5-bromoindole is complex and its melting point can be reasoned through considering the effects of the specific functional groups present and the structure of the molecule. Starting with the basic indole unit, which combines a benzene ring with a pyrrole ring, indole itself has a melting point of 52 degrees Celsius. The amino group (-NH2) attached to the benzene ring generally increases the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, providing a stronger intermolecular force. This effect could increase the indole's melting point by roughly 40-50 degrees Celsius. On the other hand, the bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring and is significantly larger and heavier. This increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which usually elevates the melting point substantially as well, by approximately 20-30 degrees Celsius. Combining these effects, we can make a prediction.",
        "Prediction": "Indole basic unit: 52 degrees Celsius, Amino group: +40 to +50 degrees Celsius, Bromine substitution: +20 to +30 degrees Celsius. Predicted melting point: 112 to 132 degrees Celsius.",
