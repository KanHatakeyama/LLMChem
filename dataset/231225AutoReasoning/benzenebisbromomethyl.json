        "Reason": "The basic unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of each bromomethyl group contributes to raising the melting point due to increased molecular weight, polarity, and potential for intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole forces and possible halogen bonding. A bromomethyl group contains a bromine atom which significantly increases the molecular weight and polarizability compared to a methyl group. This addition typically raises the melting point by approximately 70\u00b0C per bromomethyl group. There are two bromomethyl groups attached to the benzene ring which overall increases the melting point significantly.",
