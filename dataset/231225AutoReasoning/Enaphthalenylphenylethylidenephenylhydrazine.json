        "Reason": "The compound in question is a derivative of hydrazine. The melting point of phenylhydrazine, a related structure, is around 19.5. Starting from this, the presence of three aromatic rings significantly increases the melting point due to the increased molecular complexity, pi-pi interactions, and van der Waals forces. Estimating the contribution of each aromatic ring: for the naphthalene ring and two phenyl rings, we approximately add +30 for naphthalene due to its larger size and condensed system, and +20 for each of the phenyl groups. The double bond contributes slightly due to restricted rotation, but not significantly enough to alter the melting point dramatically, hence we can estimate this increase to be around +5. The hydrazine moiety's influence on the melting point is minimized by the other substituents, so its effect is considered neutral in this context. This results in an overall estimated increase of 30 (naphthalene) + 2x20 (phenyl groups) + 5 (double bond) = 75. Adding this to the baseline of phenylhydrazine's melting point yields a predicted value.",
