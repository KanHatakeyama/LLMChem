        "Reason": "The tartaric acid molecule contains four hydroxyl groups and two carboxylic acid groups. The hydroxyl groups will contribute towards hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point significantly. Each hydroxyl group may contribute approximately +20 to the melting point relative to a similar non-hydrogen-bonding group. Carboxylic acid groups also engage in hydrogen bonding and can form strong intermolecular dimeric associations via a pair of hydrogen bonds. As a result, each carboxylic acid group can contribute even more, with an estimated value of +40 to the melting point. Therefore, the overall effect of the hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups should be substantial. However, these are incremental adjustments based on a hypothetical non-functionalized carbon backbone, and the actual melting point will depend on the cumulative effect of all functional groups and their specific arrangement within the molecular structure.",
        "Prediction": "If we start with a hypothetical base molecule with a melting point close to zero and sum the contributions: 4 hydroxyl groups at +20 each (4 * 20 = 80) and 2 carboxylic acid groups at +40 each (2 * 40 = 80), the predicted melting point would be approximately 0 (base) + 80 (for hydroxyl groups) + 80 (for carboxylic acids) = 160.",
