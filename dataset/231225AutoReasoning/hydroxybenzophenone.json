        "Reason": "The target compound, 4-hydroxybenzophenone, is composed of a benzophenone base structure with the addition of a hydroxy group. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of around 5.5 \u00b0C. When a carbonyl group is added to form benzophenone, the melting point significantly increases because carbonyl groups can form strong dipole-dipole interactions and have the potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which typically raises the melting point by roughly 100 \u00b0C. Adding a hydroxy group to the benzophenone also increases the melting point due to the ability of the hydroxy group to form hydrogen bonds, contributing an additional 30 \u00b0C to the melting point. Therefore, the total predicted increase due to both the carbonyl and hydroxy groups would be around 130 \u00b0C.",
