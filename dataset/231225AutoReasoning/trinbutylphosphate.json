        "Reason": "The base molecule here is phosphoric acid which has a melting point of 42.35\u00b0C. The substitution of hydrogen atoms in phosphoric acid with tri-n-butyl groups has several effects: 1) Increase in molecular weight: each n-butyl group adds a certain amount of 'heaviness' to the molecule, which typically raises the melting point due to greater London dispersion forces. However, this effect is complicated by the fact that the n-butyl groups also increase the molecular size and tend to make the molecule more 'waxy' or 'oily', which can lower the melting point. 2) The introduction of bulky n-butyl groups makes the molecule more 'spread out' and can disrupt the crystal lattice structure, which is generally associated with a lowering of the melting point. Depending on which effect is dominant, the melting point may increase or decrease relative to phosphoric acid. Given that the actual melting point is -80.0\u00b0C, which is significantly lower than phosphoric acid, the introduction of the n-butyl groups appears to greatly disrupt the crystal lattice structure, leading to a drastically lower melting point. Since each n-butyl group causes a similar disruption, we'll consider around -40\u00b0C for each n-butyl group attached.",
