        "Reason": "The basic unit of 3,3-dimethylbut-1-yne is acetylene, which has a melting point of -80.8. Two methyl groups are present, which slightly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals forces. However, as they are on the same carbon, the symmetrical effect may not be as large compared to when they are on different carbons, since steric hindrance will not significantly affect the melting behavior. Alkynes have generally lower melting points than alkanes and alkenes due to their linear geometry which leads to less efficient packing in the solid state. However, in this case the additional methyl groups make the molecule somewhat less linear. Each methyl group could be predicted to increase the melting point by approximately +1-2 degrees.",
