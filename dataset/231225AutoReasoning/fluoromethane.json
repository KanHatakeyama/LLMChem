        "Reason": "The starting reference compound here can be methane, which has a melting point of -182.5\u00b0C. Fluorine is more electronegative and pulls electron density away from the carbon, which increases the polarity of the molecule. This effect allows the molecules to engage in stronger dipole-dipole interactions compared to methane. However, as fluoromethane is still a gas at room temperature, these interactions do not raise the melting point to a high value. Furthermore, the small size of the molecule means induced-dipole interactions (London dispersion forces) are still relatively weak. The addition of a fluorine can be predicted to raise the melting point due to these increased dipole interactions by approximately +40\u00b0C.",
