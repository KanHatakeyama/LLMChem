        "Reason": "Kaempferol is a flavonoid compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a phenolic structure which contribute to its high melting point. The base structure is a fused-ring system (phenyl and pyran) which is known to have a high melting point due to the stability of the aromatic system. The hydroxyl groups (OH) form intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, significantly raising the melting point. For each hydroxyl group, we can estimate an increase in the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. A similar flavonoid, quercetin, which has a close structural resemblance, has a melting point of about 316\u00b0C. The melting point of kaempferol may be slightly lower due to it having one less hydroxyl group than quercetin.",
        "Prediction": "272\u00b0C (Baseline flavonoid fused-ring system: 250\u00b0C, 3 OH groups: +3x7.5\u00b0C = 22.5\u00b0C, one less OH group than quercetin: -1.5\u00b0C)",
