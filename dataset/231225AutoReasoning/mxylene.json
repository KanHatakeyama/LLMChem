        "Reason": "The melting point of m-xylene can be predicted based on the changes due to functional groups attached to the benzene ring. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point near 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the two methyl groups in m-xylene increases the melting point due to the larger molecular weight and increased London dispersion forces, but their meta positioning on the benzene ring means less symmetry and potential for reduced packing efficiency compared to the para-position, which can reduce the melting point slightly. Therefore, we will add the effect of each methyl group and subtract a small amount for the meta positioning. Methyl group: +20\u00b0C * 2 (since there are two methyl groups), Meta effect: -5\u00b0C (less optimal packing).",
