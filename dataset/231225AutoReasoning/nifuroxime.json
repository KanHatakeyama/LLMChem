        "Reason": "Nifuroxime is based on a heterocyclic aromatic compound, similar to furan. The core furan unit in nifuroxime, which has a melting point around 31 degrees Celsius, is modified significantly by the addition of various functional groups. The nitro group (\u2013NO2) significantly increases the melting point by around +80 degrees Celsius due to its strong electron-withdrawing effect, which stabilizes the aromatic ring and increases intermolecular forces such as dipole interactions. The oxime group (\u2013C=NOH) contributes an additional +40 degrees Celsius because of the hydrogen-bonding ability and dipole interactions. Lastly, the two chloro substituents also increase the melting point, each by approximately +10 degrees Celsius, due to their electron-withdrawing nature and additional van der Waals forces. The cumulative effect of all these functional groups on the furan unit results in the predicted melting point.",
        "Prediction": "Elsewhere, add first the individual contributions: Furan (+31), Nitro group (+80), Oxime group (+40), Chloro substituents (2 x +10). Then, calculate the total predicted melting point: 31 + 80 + 40 + 2(10) = 171 degrees Celsius.",
