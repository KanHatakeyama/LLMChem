        "Reason": "The target compound is Cyanamide with a molecular structure represented by N#CN. The basic unit to consider is the cyano group (-C\u2261N) attached to an amine (-NH2). Amines typically decrease the melting point due to their ability to donate a hydrogen bond, which can lead to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, but they also contribute to some degree of polarity which can raise the melting point. Cyano groups, being highly electronegative, highly polar, and capable of hydrogen bonding, tend to increase the melting point of a molecule. For the purpose of quantitative reasoning, let's assume the following effects for the functional groups based on literature and similar chemical structures: Amine group: -5 (due to hydrogen bond donation capability), Cyano group: +30 (due to strong polarity and hydrogen bonding).",
