        "Reason": "The melting point of quinoline is 23\u00b0C. 6-nitro group substitution generally increases the melting point due to the introduction of stronger intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and potential hydrogen bonding, which results in greater lattice energy in the solid state. Quinoline has a relatively low melting point because it's a lighter, aromatic molecule with modest dipole-dipole interactions. The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, which can stabilize the charge distribution, causing an increase in melting point. The effect can be estimated around +130\u00b0C for the nitro group effect on the aromatic system.",
