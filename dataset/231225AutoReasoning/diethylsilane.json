The addition of ethyl groups raises the melting point due to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each ethyl group (\u2013CH2CH3) contributes to the melting point increase compared to hydrogen atoms in silane. For similar compounds, an ethyl group can typically increase the melting point by roughly +10\u00b0C to +15\u00b0C per group. Diethylsilane has two ethyl groups, so the combined effect of two ethyl groups is approximately 2 x (+10 to +15\u00b0C).",
