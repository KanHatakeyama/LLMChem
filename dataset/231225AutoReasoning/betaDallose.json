        "Reason": "The basic unit we are considering is an open-chain form of an aliphatic hexose sugar. The open-chain form of glucose, which is structurally similar to allose, has a melting point around 146\u00b0C. For beta-D-allose, structural isomerism will very likely result in a similar melting point given that the hydroxyl groups (-OH) and the aldehyde group at the terminus of the molecule are present in both sugars and have similar intermolecular hydrogen bonding capabilities. The effect of each hydroxyl group is difficult to quantify individually; however, they collectively contribute to strong hydrogen bonding, which would increase the melting point relative to hydrocarbons of similar molecular weight. The stereochemistry at each carbon might result in minimal differences, but these are generally less significant in terms of melting point. The prediction should thus be close to that of glucose, adjusted slightly for the subtle differences in stereochemistry of allose compared to glucose. Since these differences likely won't significantly disrupt the hydrogen bonding network, the change in melting point should be minimal, and can be considered within a variation range of about 1-2\u00b0C either increase or decrease.",
