        "Reason": "The base structure of alkanes (e.g., octane C8H18) has a melting point around -57\u00b0C. Octanal has an aldehyde functional group which creates a small dipole, allowing for stronger intermolecular forces than alkanes but weaker than alcohols. For the aldehyde group, this could increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C. However, the overall effect on the melting point might be less than predicted due to the linear structure and large carbon chain which tend to decrease molecular compactness and intermolecular forces.",
