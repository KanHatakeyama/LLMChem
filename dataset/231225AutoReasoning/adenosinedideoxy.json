        "Reason": "The compound 'adenosine, 2',3'-dideoxy-' consists of a purine base (adenine) attached to a 2',3'-dideoxyribose sugar. The purine base is a bicyclic structure that would contribute to a higher melting point due to the rigid planar structure and potential for strong \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. Additionally, hydrogen bonding from the amine and from the remaining hydroxyl group on the sugar contribute to the melting point. However, the deoxyribose has two hydroxyl groups less than a normal ribose, which would decrease the melting point. The deoxyribose sugar itself also imparts a rigid structure due to the ring, contributing to a high melting point. A basic purine such as adenine has a melting point of around 360 (due to strong \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and hydrogen bonding). Deoxyribose contribution is less clear but would likely add less heat resistance than a fully hydroxylated ribose (which adds approximately +70). Although it's hard to quantify without exact analogue data, considering the decreased hydrogen bonding due to 2',3'-dideoxy modification, we can estimate a lower increase from the sugar. Therefore, a rough estimate for the effects could be: Adenine base: 360, Loss of two hydroxyl groups: -90 each, 5-membered ring (dideoxyribose): +50.",

        "Reason": "Adenosine, 2',3'-dideoxy-, contains a purine base (adenine), which has a melting point of around 360 due to strong \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and hydrogen bonding. The adenine part of the molecule, being a bicyclic aromatic structure, contributes significantly to a higher melting point. However, the molecule is a 2',3'-dideoxy derivative, meaning it lacks two hydroxyl groups present in regular ribose sugar. Each hydroxyl group contributes significantly to the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capabilities. The loss of these two hydroxyl groups is expected to reduce the melting point. For a rough estimation, if each hydroxyl group contributes around +70 to the melting point, the loss of two would deduct roughly 140 from the base value of adenine. The dideoxyribose sugar, being a 5-membered ring, does contribute to the melting point due to its rigid structure; however, without the hydroxyl groups, this effect is less than that of a fully hydroxylated sugar. A conservative estimation for the contribution of the dideoxyribose could be around +50. Hence, the predicted melting point would be the sum of the adenine melting point, minus the deductions for the missing hydroxyl groups, plus the contribution from the dideoxyribose.",
