        "Reason": "Starting with benzene as a base unit, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we consider the effects of the two substituents. The methyl group typically reduces melting point due to its electron-donating properties and increase in molecular size, which makes the overall molecule less symmetrical and can interfere with crystal packing. This impact can be estimated as -20\u00b0C decrease in melting point. The ethyl group would have a similar but slightly stronger effect, due to its larger size compared to methyl, estimated at -25\u00b0C. The proximity of the two groups (meta-position) might lessen the impact slightly, due to potential non-covalent interactions between them, but this effect will be minor, estimated at +5\u00b0C. Adding these effects to the base melting point of benzene gives us: 5.5 (base benzene) - 20 (methyl group) - 25 (ethyl group) + 5 (meta-position interaction) = -34.5\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "Starting with benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we adjust for the two substituents. A methyl group can lead to a decrease in melting point due to its electron-donating nature and its effect on molecular symmetry which generally disrupts crystal packing. This typically results in a decrease of about -20\u00b0C for the melting point. The ethyl group, being larger than a methyl group, can further disrupt the crystal packing due to its increased steric bulk. The additional -CH2- in the ethyl group likely contributes a similar decrease; therefore, the effect of the ethyl group on the melting point can be estimated as -30\u00b0C. The meta-arrangement of the substituents does provide some steric hindrance between the groups, which might slightly mitigate the lowering of the melting point. However, this kind of steric interaction is relatively weak compared to the overall effect of the substituent size and symmetry on the melting point, thus it is predicted to contribute a minor increase, estimated at +5\u00b0C. Therefore, the predicted changes to the melting point of benzene are: 5.5 (benzene) - 20 (methyl group) - 30 (ethyl group) + 5 (meta-interaction) = -39.5\u00b0C.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for this consideration is benzene, which has a melting point at 5.5\u00b0C. Adding a methyl group tends to increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the slight increase in London dispersion forces; we can estimate this increase to be +20\u00b0C. An ethyl group has a larger effect than a methyl group because it is bigger and provides more surface for dispersion forces; this additional ethyl group might further increase the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. However, the position of the substituents (meta-position in this case) introduces steric hindrance and decreases the symmetry of the molecule, which could disrupt crystalline packing and decrease the melting point. This steric effect might reduce the melting point by around -60\u00b0C. If we sum up all adjustments, we get an increase of 50\u00b0C from substituents and a decrease of 60\u00b0C from steric hindrance and loss of symmetry.",

        "Reason": "The basic unit for this consideration is benzene, which has a melting point at 5.5\u00b0C. Adding a methyl group to benzene increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the slight increase in London dispersion forces; this increase could be estimated to be +5\u00b0C, as the effect on melting point is less pronounced than on boiling point. An ethyl group would have a greater effect than a methyl group because of its larger size, but in the context of melting points, the increase would not be as large as in boiling points due to the packing considerations, so we could estimate this to be an additional +10\u00b0C. However, the meta-substitution pattern introduces steric hindrance and reduces the symmetry of the molecule, which impairs crystalline packing and can decrease the melting point. The effect of steric hindrance and loss of symmetry might not be as drastic as -60\u00b0C since the substituents are not bulky groups that significantly disrupt the structure, so a more modest decrease of -30\u00b0C might be more realistic. If we sum up all adjustments, we get an increase of 15\u00b0C from substituents and a decrease of 30\u00b0C from the steric effects.",
