        "Reason": "The melting point of a compound can be affected by various factors including molecular weight, polarity, and the presence of functional groups. For the target compound 1-bromo-2-chloro-4-nitrobenzene, we must consider these aspects:\n- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C.\n- Bromine substituent: +30 (due to the significant increase in molecular weight and size).\n- Chlorine substituent: +15 (due to the increase in molecular weight and inductive effect; less of an effect than bromine due to smaller size).\n- Nitro group: +20 (due to strong electron-withdrawing properties, which can strengthen the compound's internal lattice making it harder to melt).\nHowever, it's important to note that these individual contributions are estimates, and the overall melting point prediction should account for potential interactions between substituents as well.",
