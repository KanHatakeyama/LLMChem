        "Reason": "The target compound carbon disulfide has a basic building unit of sulfur (S), which forms part of the molecule as S=C=S. The influence of sulfur in forming the linear structure leads to weak van der Waals forces owing to the small size and relatively less electron cloud which results in relatively weak intermolecular forces. Additionally, compared to a similar linear molecule like carbon dioxide (CO2), the double bonded sulfur does not significantly increase the intermolecular forces as much as the oxygen would due to its lower electronegativity. The absence of complex functionality in this compound keeps the melting point low. Since sulfur's contribution to melting point is considerably less potent than that of oxygen, we can expect the melting point to be lower than CO2, which sublimates at -78.5 \u00b0C. Considering the effect of two sulfur atoms might slightly decrease the melting point compared to a compound with a single sulfur because of their relatively larger atomic size, lower electronegativity, and heavier molecular weight.",
