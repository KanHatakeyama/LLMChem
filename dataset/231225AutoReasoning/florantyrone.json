        "Reason": "The compound florantyrone consists of a naphthalene core with two additional rings fused on the sides, which makes it a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. This structure provides high rigidity and an extensive system of delocalized electrons, which greatly increases the melting point. Basic naphthalene has a melting point of about 80\u00b0C. Associated with this structure, florantyrone has two carboxylic acid groups, which are capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds act to increase the melting point because of the additional energy required to break them during the phase transition from solid to liquid. Each carboxylic acid group might roughly add about 40\u00b0C to the melting point. However, for highly conjugated and planar systems like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the added increments might be less than for aliphatic structures due to the already high base melting point and the effect of stacking interactions between the flat molecules. Therefore, a more conservative estimate might be an addition of about 30\u00b0C for each carboxylic group considering the pre-existing molecular stability due to \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between aromatic rings.",
        "Prediction": "140 (base naphthalene) + 30 (first carboxylic acid) + 30 (second carboxylic acid) = 200\u00b0C",
