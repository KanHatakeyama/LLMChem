        "Reason": "The compound (1r,4r)-(+)-camphor is a bicyclic ketone. The basic structure is the bicyclic ring system, which provides a certain amount of rigidity and thus a higher melting point compared to non-cyclic or smaller ring compounds. Next, we have a ketone functional group, which is capable of dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding with other molecules, which will raise the melting point. Additionally, the presence of methyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, albeit not as substantially as the ring structure and ketone functional group. Starting from a typical ketone's melting point, which could be on the lower side due to lesser molecular weight and size (for example, acetone has a melting point of -94.9 \u00b0C), we would expect significant increases due to the bicyclic structure and the ketone's ability to engage in stronger intermolecular forces. As a rough estimate: Bicyclic structure: +150\u00b0C due to rigidity and increased intermolecular contacts, Ketone group: +50\u00b0C due to capability of hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, Methyl groups: +20\u00b0C for the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. This would sum up to a substantial increase from a basic ketone's low melting point.",
