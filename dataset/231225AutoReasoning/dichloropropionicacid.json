        "Reason": "The basic unit, acetic acid has a melting point of 16.6. A chloro substituent generally decreases the melting point due to the additional polarity and possible steric hindrance it introduces; for each chloro group, the effect is approximately -20. However, the presence of two chloro groups close to each other can lead to intramolecular interactions that may mitigate this drop somewhat. The carboxyl group already present in acetic acid is the main driver for its melting point due to hydrogen bonding, so additional functional groups have a smaller relative effect. Considering the presence of two chloro groups, the net expected change would be roughly -40 from acetic acid.",
