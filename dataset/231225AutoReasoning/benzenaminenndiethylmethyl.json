        "Reason": "Target compound: N,N-diethyl-2-methylbenzenamine. Basic unit, benzenamine (aniline) has a melting point of -6\u00b0C. The N,N-diethyl substitution introduces steric hindrance and reduces the molecule's ability to hydrogen bond, which significantly lowers the melting point. The decrease due to diethyl groups is estimated at -50\u00b0C. The methyl group at the 2-position increases the molecular size and enhances van der Waals forces, slightly raising the melting point. The estimated increase for a methyl group is +5\u00b0C. The combination of diethyl and methyl groups affect the melting point in opposing ways, but the dominant effect is the disruption of hydrogen bonding, leading to a lower overall melting point.",
