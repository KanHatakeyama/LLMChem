        "Reason": "The basic unit, cyclooctane, has a melting point around -57\u00b0C. The addition of a double bond in cis-cyclooctene increases the melting point because of the restricted rotation and the increase in rigidity of the molecule. Typically, a double bond in a ring of this size could increase the melting point by approximately 30 to 40\u00b0C as it changes the packing of the molecules in the solid phase, making it more ordered than in cyclooctane. However, because the ring strain and the cis configuration introduce some extra flexibility to the molecule, the actual increase might be less than if it were a trans double bond or in a smaller ring.",
