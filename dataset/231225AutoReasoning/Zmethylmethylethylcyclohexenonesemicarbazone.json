        "Reason": "The basic structure to consider here is cyclohexanone, which has a melting point of 6.5 degrees Celsius. When predicting the melting point of the target compound, we need to account for the effects of the functional groups present.\n\n- The addition of a semicarbazone group typically raises the melting point significantly, due to the potential for strong hydrogen bonding and the rigid structure it imposes on the compound. This effect can increase the melting point by approximately 150 degrees Celsius.\n\n- The presence of two alkyl substituents (methyl and isopropyl) can further influence the melting point. Alkyl substituents generally raise the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces but have a smaller effect compared to polar functional groups. Each methyl group can raise the melting point by about 5 degrees Celsius, and the isopropyl group, being larger, could contribute an increase of about 12 degrees Celsius.\n\n- The alkene group typically has a minimal direct effect on the melting point compared to the aforementioned functional groups, so its effect will be considered negligible in this prediction.\n\nIn conclusion, we predict the compound's melting point by adding these increases to the base value of cyclohexanone.",
        "Prediction": "The predicted melting point of the compound is approximately 220 degrees Celsius (6.5 base + 150 semicarbazone + 2 * 5 methyl groups + 12 isopropyl group).",
