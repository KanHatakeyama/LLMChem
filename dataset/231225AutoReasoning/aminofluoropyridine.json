        "Reason": "The basic unit, pyridine, has a melting point of around -42 degrees Celsius. The amino group (-NH2) on the pyridine typically raises the melting point due to the possibility for hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +70 to +100 degrees Celsius. The fluorine substituent, being electronegative and small, might raise the melting point slightly, perhaps by +5 to +10 degrees Celsius, due to increased molecular polarity and possible dipole-dipole interactions. However, its small size might not contribute a large increment to the melting point.",
