        "Reason": "The compound (2-aminoethoxy)acetic acid has several functional groups that affect its melting point. The base structure is two carbon aliphatic chain, which has a very low melting point. However, having an amino (-NH2) group generally increases the melting point due to possibilities for hydrogen bonding (+50). An ether group (C-O-C) might slightly lower the melting point due to the ether oxygen's branching effect (-5). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) greatly increases the melting point because of the strong hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions it can participate in with neighboring molecules (+120). Combining these effects, we predict the melting point adjustment.",
        "Prediction": "Base aliphatic chain: assumed very low (5), Amino group: +50, Ether group: -5, Carboxylic acid group: +120; Predicted melting point = 5 + 50 - 5 + 120 = 170",
