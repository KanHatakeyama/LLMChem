        "Reason": "The basic unit here is benzene, which has a melting point of roughly 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a second benzene ring in naphthalene raises the melting point significantly due to the increased molecular weight and pi-pi stacking interactions, naphthalene itself has a melting point of around 80\u00b0C. The hydrazine group (-NHNH2) is capable of hydrogen bonding, and this typically raises the melting point further due to the increased intermolecular forces. However, the exact contribution of a hydrazine group is complex, given it can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds, but a rough estimate of its effect could be around +15\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C. Therefore, for 1-naphthylhydrazine, we are starting with the naphthalene base, and adding the effect of the hydrazine group.",

        "Reason": "The base unit is naphthalene, which has a melting point of approximately 80\u00b0C. Adding the functional hydrazine group (-NHNH2) brings the potential for both hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which should increase the melting point compared to naphthalene. The hydrazine group can have a complex impact on the melting point due to its potential for multiple hydrogen bonds. Estimating a conservative increase of approximately 20\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C for the presence of the hydrazine group would be a reasonable approximation based on its potential for extensive hydrogen bonding.",
