        "Reason": "The base unit for comparison will be decanoic acid, which has a melting point of 31.6\u00b0C. The presence of the double bond in 10-undecenoic acid reduces the melting point due to the double bond creating a kink in the molecule, which results in less efficient packing in the solid state. This reduction can be approximated at -10\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group affects the melting point by introducing the possibility for hydrogen bonding, which would typically raise the melting point; however, since we are starting with decanoic acid as the base, which already has a carboxylic acid group, there's no additional effect to consider for the melting point change.",
