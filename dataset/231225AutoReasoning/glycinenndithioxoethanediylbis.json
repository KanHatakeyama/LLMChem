        "Reason": "The basic unit can be considered as glycine, which has a melting point of approximately 233 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the dithiooxamide group (1,2-dithioxo-1,2-ethanediyl group) adds significant rigidity to the structure and increases potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Additionally, this group contributes to resonance stability and has bulky sulfur atoms, which may increase the melting point. However, the overall molecule is still relatively small, which limits the extent of these effects. The dithiooxamide group results in a decrease of melting point due to the less symmetrical nature of the molecule compared to the simple amino acid, glycine. Given this group typically lowers the melting point relative to more symmetrical di-carboxylic structures, we might predict a decrease of around -12.5 degrees Celsius from the basic glycine.",
