        "Reason": "The compound 1,3-dihydroxyacetone consists of a basic acetone unit with two additional hydroxyl (OH) groups on the first and third carbon atoms. The base structure, acetone, has a melting point of -94.9 degrees Celsius. Hydroxyl groups generally increase the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds, which stabilize the solid state and require more energy to break when transitioning to the liquid state. Each OH group might be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 80 degrees Celsius, as a general effect of strong hydrogen bonding.",
