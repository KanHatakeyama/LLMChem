            "Reason": "To predict the melting point of heroin, we must consider the following factors: Base structure - Morphine has a melting point of around 254 degrees Celsius. Structure modifications: Acetyl groups: -20 to -40 each (depending on their interaction with the overall molecule, here a conservative average of -30 is used due to the introduction of ester functional groups which generally lower the melting point because they often can't engage in as strong hydrogen bonding as hydroxyl groups they replace) Diphenyl linkage: -5 (adding rigidity to the structure, which might slightly increase the melting point, but since it replaces a hydrogen bond capable hydroxyl group, the net effect is likely a slight decrease). Total modification from 3 acetyl groups and 1 diphenyl linkage: 3(-30) + (-5) = -90 + (-5) = -95.",

            "Test (Predicted reason)": "\nHeroin's melting point is challenging to predict due to its complex structure, which includes a phenanthrene core, a nitro functional group, and a methyl ester group. The phenanthrene core has a high melting point due to its planarity and the presence of a conjugated double bond. The nitro functional group can increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The methyl ester group can also contribute to the melting point due to its dipole moment and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of these functional groups and their interactions with each other and the phenanthrene core can lead to a complex interplay of effects on the melting point.\n\nTo estimate the melting point of heroin, we need to consider the effects of each functional group and their interactions. The phenanthrene core has a melting point of around 200-250\u00b0C, while the nitro functional group can increase the melting point by around 50-100\u00b0C. The methyl ester group can also increase the melting point by around 20-30\u00b0C. The interactions between these functional groups can lead to a complex interplay of effects on the melting point, which can be difficult to predict accurately.\n\nBased on the available data, the melting point of heroin is estimated to be around 250-300\u00b0C. However, this value is subject to significant uncertainty due to the complexity of the molecule and the challenges of predicting the effects of the various functional groups on the melting point.\n##Prediction: 280.0 #include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\n\n",

            "Reason": "The base unit for 2-amino-5-chlorobenzonitrile is benzene with a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitrile group generally adds around +35\u00b0C due to its strong dipole and the potential for polar interactions. The amino group is likely to contribute +50\u00b0C because it can participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding and has its own dipole moment. The chlorine substituent is expected to contribute around +5\u00b0C, as while heavier halogens raise the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces, the effect is not as pronounced as with polar groups. All these effects combined especially considering the synergistic effect of hydrogen bonding that could occur between the amino and nitrile groups, can contribute to an overall increase. However, there might be some intramolecular interaction that could slightly reduce this expected increase, therefore, some balancing is needed when estimating the melting point.",

            "Reason": "The target compound, 4-Methylpentan-2-one, is an alkyl ketone. For the purpose of this exercise, we will consider pentane as the base hydrocarbon, which has a melting point of around -130\u00b0C. The addition of a methyl group typically causes the melting point to shift upwards because it increases the molecular weight and the surface area, which increases the van der Waals forces. This can be estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The introduction of a carbonyl group (C=O) has two opposing effects: it can cause a decrease due to steric strain and reduced rotational freedom around the C-C bond adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, but it can also introduce dipole-dipole interactions, which usually raise the melting point. Let's estimate the net effect of the ketone group to be an increase of about +45\u00b0C, considering that the dipole-dipole interactions have a substantial effect. Combining these adjustments, the predicted melting point would be -130\u00b0C + 5\u00b0C (from the methyl group) + 45\u00b0C (from the ketone group).",

As a rough estimate, a typical steroid compound without any functional groups might melt around 160\u00b0C.\n- Hydroxyl groups (OH): Generally, each hydroxyl group can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capability. For simple compounds, a single hydroxyl group might increase the temperature by about 5\u00b0C. Our compound has two hydroxyl groups, which could increase the melting point by 10\u00b0C total.\n- Ethynyl group (C#C): The presence of this group introduces additional rigidity and potential for pi-pi interactions, which might increase the melting point by around 10\u00b0C.\n- Methyl group (CH3): Branched structures such as methyl groups can also slightly increase the melting point.

The basic structure of xanthine has a melting point of approximately 237\u00b0C. Each functional group's contribution to the melting point can be estimated separately: the ketone groups (C=O) are strongly polar and can engage in hydrogen bonding, thereby significantly raising the melting point collectively by an estimated 40\u00b0C. The amine groups (N-CH3) introduce steric hindrance and provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point by approximately 15\u00b0C. The imidazole ring (part of the purine structure) also contributes to the stability and the rigidity of the molecule, which is expected to raise the melting point, but to a less extent than polar functional groups.
