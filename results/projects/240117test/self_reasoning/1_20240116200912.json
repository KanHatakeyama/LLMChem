    "Reason": "Pyrinoline is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The base structure is pyridine, which has a melting point of 10.5 degrees Celsius. The nitro functional group (NO2) typically raises the melting point by roughly 20-30 degrees due to increased polarity and dipole-dipole interactions. The presence of multiple nitro functional groups can amplify this effect. Additionally, the presence of multiple aromatic rings contributes to the rigidity of the molecule and increases intermolecular forces, potentially raising the melting point by 20-30 degrees for each ring system present. The sulfur atom in the sulfoxide functional group (SO) can also contribute to the melting point, as it is a heavy atom that increases the molecular weight and can form hydrogen bonds, potentially raising the melting point by 10-20 degrees.",
