    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The two ethenyl (vinyl) groups each introduce additional steric hindrance and electron donating ability via their alkene double bond, which typically decreases the melting point since they disrupt the crystal lattice and lower intermolecular attractions. However, the release of ring strain that comes with substitution at the meta positions tends to raise melting points. Nonetheless, the overall effect of the vinyl groups is more significant in this case. Estimating the influence of each vinyl group to be a decrease of around 30\u00b0C, we get a combined shift of -60\u00b0C.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Basic unit (benzene): 5.5\u00b0C\n- Two vinyl groups: -60\u00b0C \u2248 -30\u00b0C\nCombined estimated effect: 5.5\u00b0C - (-30\u00b0C) \u2248 -35.5\u00b0C",
