    "Reason": "- The base molecule, sulfoxide, has a melting point of 105 degrees Celsius. \n- The two benzene rings add significant molecular weight and polarizability, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees. \n- The sulfur atom adds additional electronegativity and polarizability, which can further increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees.",
