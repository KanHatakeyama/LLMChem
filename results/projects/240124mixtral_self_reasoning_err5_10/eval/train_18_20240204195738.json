Then, we account for the following functional group effects: \n- Phenyl groups: The two phenyl rings should significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. \n- Carbonyl groups: The two carbonyl groups (one from the ketone and one from the amide) can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure as well, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl. \n- Amide linkage: The amide group also has the potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing a similar effect as the carbonyl, so around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \n- Alkenyl linkage: The presence of a double bond adjacent to a phenyl group could moderately increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at about +5 to +10\u00b0C. \nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +60 to +100\u00b0C for the phenyl groups, +40 to +80\u00b0C for the carbonyl groups, +20 to +30\u00b0C for the amide group, and +5 to +10\u00b0C for the alkenyl linkage.",

The molecular structure also includes five methoxy groups; each can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each ether.

Since hydrogen bonds are already present in ethanol, the additional oxygen atom allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methoxy group into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding.

We can start with the basic unit of a phenyl group, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.\n- Phenyl groups: Dextromoramide has three phenyl groups, which should significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.\n- Amide linkages: The molecule has two amide linkages, which can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure. Each amide group may contribute around +20 to +40\u00b0C.\n- Tertiary amine: The tertiary amine group in dextromoramide can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. We can estimate this contribution to be around +5 to +10\u00b0C.\n- Methyl groups: The presence of methyl groups in the molecule can slightly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. We can estimate this contribution to be around +1 to +5\u00b0C for each methyl group.\nTaking these factors into account, we can estimate the melting point of dextromoramide by summing the contributions to the phenyl group's melting point: +60 to +100\u00b0C for the phenyl groups, +40 to +80\u00b0C for the amide linkages, and +5 to +10\u00b0C for the tertiary amine.\n##Prediction: 165.0\n\n\n#Problem",
