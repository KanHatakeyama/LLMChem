Then, we account for the following functional group effects: \n- Phenyl groups: The two phenyl rings should significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. \n- Carbonyl groups: The two carbonyl groups (one from the ketone and one from the amide) can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure as well, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl. \n- Amide linkage: The amide group also has the potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing a similar effect as the carbonyl, so around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \n- Alkenyl linkage: The presence of a double bond adjacent to a phenyl group could moderately increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at about +5 to +10\u00b0C. \nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +60 to +100\u00b0C for the phenyl groups, +40 to +80\u00b0C for the carbonyl groups, +20 to +30\u00b0C for the amide group, and +5 to +10\u00b0C for the alkenyl linkage.",

The presence of three phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. Lastly, the hydrazono-functionalities and thiadiazole ring introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for three phenyl groups, we have +60\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +50\u00b0C, the carbonyl function at +30\u00b0C (lesser than a typical ketone due to conjugation and steric hindrance by the adjacent large groups), and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +40\u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system).
