The trifluoromethyl group (\u2013CF3) is a bulky group that increases the molecular weight and volume, which might minutely raise the melting point. However, the presence of the fluorine atom and the trifluoromethyl group can lead to a significant increase due to the electronegativity of fluorine, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 4 fluorines) = 60 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 65.5\n\n\n#Problem",
