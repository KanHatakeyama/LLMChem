The molecular structure also includes five methoxy groups; each can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each ether.
