The chlorine atom is more electronegative than the fluorine atom, and it is also bulkier, which can lead to a more significant increase in the melting point. The chlorine atom is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 15-20\u00b0C, while the fluorine atom is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 5-10\u00b0C.
