    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine atom in the 3'-position and the fluorine atom in the 4'-position can influence the melting point due to the following factors: (1) The chlorine atom is a halogen and a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to the increased dipole moment and intermolecular forces. (2) The fluorine atom is also a halogen and an electron-withdrawing group, but it has a smaller effect than chlorine. The fluorine atom can increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to the increased dipole moment and intermolecular forces. (3) The presence of two halogens in the ortho-position can lead to a steric hindrance effect, which can decrease the melting point by approximately -5\u00b0C due to the disruption of the crystal lattice.",
