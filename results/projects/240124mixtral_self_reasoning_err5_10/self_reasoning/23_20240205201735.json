    "Reason": "3-hydroxybenzoic acid has a melting point of 212\u00b0C. The introduction of an iodine atom in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group and the carboxylic acid group in the molecule already allows for hydrogen bonding. The addition of the iodine atom does not significantly increase the hydrogen bonding potential. Therefore, the net effect should be an increase due to molecular size but not as significant as the increase observed with the hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups.",
