    "Reason": "##The basic unit for comparison is N-methylacetamide, which has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in isopropyl n-phenylcarbamate will affect its melting point: (1) The phenyl group, which could add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The isopropyl group (CC(C)) is a branched alkyl group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The carbamate group (OC(=O)N) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
