    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole is a compound that consists of a pyrrole ring connected to a phenylsulfonyl group. To estimate the melting point, we can compare it to the melting points of its constituent parts: pyrrole and phenylsulfonyl. Pyrrole has a melting point of -25.0\u00b0C, while phenylsulfonyl has a melting point of 110.0\u00b0C. The presence of the phenylsulfonyl group significantly increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding between the sulfonyl oxygen atoms and the pyrrole nitrogen atom. The melting point increase can be estimated to be around 100\u00b0C, resulting in a predicted melting point of 85.0\u00b0C for 1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole.",
