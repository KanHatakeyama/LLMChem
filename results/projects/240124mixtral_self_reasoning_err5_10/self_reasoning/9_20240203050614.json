    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol is a simple ether with a hydroxyl group. The melting point of ethanol is -114.1\u00b0C, and the melting point of methanol is -97.8\u00b0C. The presence of the ether linkage and the hydroxyl group will increase the melting point compared to ethanol and methanol due to the potential for hydrogen bonding. The ether linkage may contribute around +10 to +20\u00b0C, and the hydroxyl group may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
