    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is acetamide, which has a melting point of 82\u00b0C. The presence of the phenyl group in the acetamide structure increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The double bond in the phenyl group also increases the rigidity of the molecule, which can further increase the melting point. The addition of the phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
