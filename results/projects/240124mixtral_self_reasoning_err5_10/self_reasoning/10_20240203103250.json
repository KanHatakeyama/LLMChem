    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a compound with a cyclopentene ring and a methyl substituent. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5\u00b0C. The presence of the methyl group in 1-methylcyclopentene increases the molecular weight and introduces a degree of asymmetry, which can lead to a higher melting point. However, the effect of a single methyl group is relatively small compared to the overall molecular structure. The melting point increase due to the methyl group can be estimated to be around +5\u00b0C.",
