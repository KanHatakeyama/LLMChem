    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol is a compound with a polar ether group and a polar alcohol group. The alcohol group (-OH) is capable of forming hydrogen bonds, which increases the melting point. The ether group (-O-) is also polar, but it does not participate in hydrogen bonding as effectively as the alcohol group. The presence of the ether group will increase the molecular weight and volume, which might slightly raise the melting point. However, the ether group's effect on the melting point is not as significant as the alcohol group. The basic unit we can compare to is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The additional functional group in 2-Methoxyethanol will affect its melting point: (1) The ether group (O-) may add about +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and volume; (2) The alcohol group (-OH) can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
