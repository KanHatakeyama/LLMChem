    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene can be compared to 1-butene (with a melting point of -138.4\u00b0C) as the basic unit. The presence of the cyclopentene ring in 1-methylcyclopentene increases the molecular weight and introduces a more rigid structure, which can lead to a higher melting point. The cyclopentene ring has a relatively low ring strain compared to smaller rings, and the methyl group introduces a slight asymmetry. The overall impact of these structural modifications is a moderate increase in the melting point.",
