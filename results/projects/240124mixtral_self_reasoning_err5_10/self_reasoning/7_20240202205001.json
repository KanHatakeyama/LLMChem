    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione is a derivative of piperazine, which has a melting point of 106-107 \u00b0C. The ethyl group in this derivative increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of the two carbonyl groups in the piperazine ring introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should thus be a slightly increased melting point compared to piperazine due to the ethyl group, but not as high as the increase observed with the hydrogen bonding alone.",
