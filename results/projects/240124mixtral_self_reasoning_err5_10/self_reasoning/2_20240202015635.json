    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a hydrocarbon with a cyclic structure and a single methyl substituent. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5\u00b0C. The methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the cyclic structure of the molecule also introduces a degree of rigidity, which can lower the melting point compared to a linear alkene. The methyl group's effect on the melting point is expected to be relatively small compared to the influence of the cyclic structure.",
