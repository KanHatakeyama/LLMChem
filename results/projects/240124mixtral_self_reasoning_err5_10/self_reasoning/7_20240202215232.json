    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide is a compound with several functional groups. To estimate its melting point, we can compare it to a simpler compound, acetamide, which has a melting point of 82 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide will affect its melting point: (1) The benzyl group (c1ccc(cc1)) is a phenyl group with a methylene linker, which could add about +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The thiosemicarbazide group (NC(=S)NN) includes functionalities related to amides and thiols, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
