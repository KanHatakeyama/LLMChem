    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane is a perfluorinated compound, which is characterized by the presence of multiple fluorine atoms bonded to a carbon backbone. The melting point of such compounds is generally affected by the following factors: (1) The presence of fluorine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C for each fluorine atom; (2) The presence of multiple fluorine atoms on the same carbon atom can lead to a gauche effect, which can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C for each gauche interaction; (3) The overall molecular symmetry can also impact the melting point, with more symmetric molecules having a higher melting point. In this case, the molecule is linear and symmetric, which can contribute to a higher melting point.",
