    "Reason": "4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone is a compound with a phenolic ring and a ketone group. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The phenolic hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds, which will increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The ketone group can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions.",
