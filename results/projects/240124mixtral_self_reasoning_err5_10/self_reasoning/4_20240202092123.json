    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a cycloalkene with a methyl substituent. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5\u00b0C. The methyl group is a small alkyl substituent that increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. However, the methyl group also introduces a slight asymmetry in the molecule, which can reduce the melting point slightly. The overall impact of the methyl group is a modest increase in the melting point, estimated to be around +5\u00b0C.",
