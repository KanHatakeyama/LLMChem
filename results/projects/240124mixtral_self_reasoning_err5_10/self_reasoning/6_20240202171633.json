    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a hydrocarbon with a cyclic structure and a methyl substituent. The basic unit we can compare to is cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5\u00b0C. The methyl group in 1-methylcyclopentene increases the molecular weight and adds a degree of asymmetry, which can increase the melting point. However, the effect of a single methyl group is relatively small. We can estimate the melting point increase to be around +5\u00b0C due to the methyl group.",
