    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a derivative of cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group in the 1-position increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces a slight asymmetry in the molecule, which can reduce the crystal lattice stability and lower the melting point. The net effect should thus be a slightly increased melting point compared to cyclopentene, but not as high as the increase observed with the methyl group alone.",
