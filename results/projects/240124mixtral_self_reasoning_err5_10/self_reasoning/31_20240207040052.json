    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine atom in the 3'-position and the fluorine atom in the 4'-position can influence the melting point due to the following factors: (1) The chlorine atom is a halogen and a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to the increased dipole moment and intermolecular forces. (2) The fluorine atom is also an electron-withdrawing group, but it is smaller and less polar than chlorine. The fluorine atom can increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to the increased dipole moment and intermolecular forces. However, the overall effect of the two halogens might be slightly less than the sum of their individual contributions due to the potential for steric hindrance and the reduced ability to form hydrogen bonds.",
