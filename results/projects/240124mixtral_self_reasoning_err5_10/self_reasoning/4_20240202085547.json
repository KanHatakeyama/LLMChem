    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a symmetrical molecule with three phenyl rings connected in a linear fashion. The melting point of a single phenyl ring (benzene) is 5.5 degrees Celsius. The melting point of biphenyl (two connected phenyl rings) is 69-70 degrees Celsius. The addition of a third phenyl ring in 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl increases the molecular weight and the potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, which should further increase the melting point. The melting point of 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is approximately 215 degrees Celsius.",
