    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane is a perfluorinated compound, meaning that all hydrogen atoms in the ethane molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms. The presence of fluorine atoms in organic compounds generally increases the melting point due to the strong intermolecular forces between the molecules, which are a result of the high electronegativity of fluorine. However, the steric hindrance caused by the large size of fluorine atoms and the repulsion between the lone pairs of electrons on the fluorine atoms can counteract this effect. In the case of 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane, the steric hindrance and repulsion between the lone pairs of electrons on the fluorine atoms are expected to be more pronounced due to the presence of five fluorine atoms. This should result in a lower melting point compared to a non-perfluorinated compound with a similar molecular weight.",
