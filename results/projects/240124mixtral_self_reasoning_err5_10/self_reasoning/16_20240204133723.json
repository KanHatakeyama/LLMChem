    "Reason": "- Benzene ring: The benzene ring contributes to the overall rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, which can increase the melting point by about +25\u00b0C.\n- Azo (-N=N-) linkage: The azo linkage can increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and its rigid structure. The azo linkage can contribute around +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C.\n- Carboxylate groups: The carboxylate groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and contribute to the overall molecular rigidity. Each carboxylate group can contribute around +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C.\n- Alkyl chains: The alkyl chains can increase the molecular weight and size, which can increase the melting point. However, the alkyl chains can also increase the molecular flexibility, which can decrease the melting point. The net effect of the alkyl chains is estimated to be around +5\u00b0C to +10\u00b0C.\nTaking these factors into account, the estimated melting point of tetraethyl 2,2'-(benzene-1,3-diyldiimino)dipropanedioate is around +70\u00b0C to +90\u00b0C.",
