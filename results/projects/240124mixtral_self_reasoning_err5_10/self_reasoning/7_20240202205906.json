    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114 \u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine atom in the 3' position and the fluorine atom in the 4' position can influence the melting point through their electron-withdrawing effects and the potential for hydrogen bonding. Chlorine is a larger atom than fluorine, and its electron-withdrawing effect is stronger, so it will have a more significant impact on the melting point. The chlorine atom is expected to increase the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to its electron-withdrawing effect and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The fluorine atom is a smaller electron-withdrawing group, and it is expected to increase the melting point by about +2 \u00b0C due to its electron-withdrawing effect and the potential for hydrogen bonding.",
