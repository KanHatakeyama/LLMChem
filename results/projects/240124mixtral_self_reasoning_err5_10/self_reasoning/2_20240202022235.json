    "Reason": "3-methylquinoline n-oxide is a compound with a quinoline core structure, which is a bicyclic aromatic system. The presence of the quinoline core will contribute to the melting point due to the aromaticity and pi-stacking interactions. The melting point increase due to the quinoline core can be estimated to be around +50\u00b0C. The methyl group is a small alkyl substituent that will increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C to the melting point. The n-oxide functional group is a polar group that can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions, which will significantly increase the melting point. The n-oxide group can be estimated to contribute around +30\u00b0C to the melting point.",
