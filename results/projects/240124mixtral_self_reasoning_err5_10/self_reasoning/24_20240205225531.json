    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a linear trimesic acid derivative. The melting point of trimesic acid is 298 \u00b0C, and the melting point of benzene is 5.5 \u00b0C. The melting point of 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is expected to be higher than benzene due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Each phenyl ring can increase the melting point by approximately 100 \u00b0C due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
