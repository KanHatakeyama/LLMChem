    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114 degrees Celsius. The introduction of halogen atoms in the ortho and para positions of the phenyl ring will affect the melting point as follows: (1) The chlorine atom (Cl) is a larger halogen atom than fluorine (F) and is expected to have a more significant effect on the melting point. The chlorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; (2) The fluorine atom (F) is a smaller halogen atom and is expected to have a less significant effect on the melting point. The fluorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
