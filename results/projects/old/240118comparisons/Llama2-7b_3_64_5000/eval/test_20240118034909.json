A common steroid such as androstane has a melting point around 90-100\u00b0C. \n- An ethyl group might add around 5\u00b0C as it increases the molecular weight and surface area, improving the van der Waals interactions. \n- A hydroxyl group tends to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, if free to interact. However, on steroids, hydroxyl groups can be involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, limiting this effect. This may add approximately 10\u00b0C. \n- A ketone, especially within the steroidal environment, can enable additional polar interactions, possibly adding around 10\u00b0C to the melting point. However, within the steroidal environment, these effects might be subdued due to restricted access, considering the ketone is within the fused ring system. \nTaking into account the above functional group effects and base steroid melting point: 90 (base steroid) + 5 (ethyl) + 10 (hydroxyl) + 10 (ketone) gives us an estimated melting point.",

Adding chlorine atoms to the structure generally increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and possible intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole attractions. Each chlorine could add approximately +62.55\u00b0C to the melting point. Acetic anhydride has two acyl groups; in chloroacetic anhydride, there's an additional chlorine on each of these groups. This could mean an additive effect of the chlorines. Thus, we can estimate the increase due to chlorine substitution: -73.1 (base acetic anhydride) + 62.55 (first Cl) + 62.55 (second Cl) = 52\u00b0C.",

            "Reason": "The compound galanthamine has multiple functional groups that contribute to its melting point. The basic structure is a tricyclic system which usually contributes to a high melting point due to rigid structure. This can start with a reference point of naphthalene, a simpler bicyclic aromatic compound, which has a melting point of around 80. Adding more rings typically increases the melting point, so the tricyclic structure could add approximately +30 to the melting point. The compound also has an ether functional group (\u2013O\u2013), three of them, which generally have minor influence on the melting point but can contribute +5 for each due to their polar nature and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions. The tertiary amine (\u2013N(C)\u2013) can have variable effects on the melting point due to its potential for hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions. We might estimate this group could contribute +10. Altogether, the cumulative effect of the functional groups can be estimated quantitatively as follows:\n- Basic tricyclic structure: +30\n- Three ether groups: 3 * +5 = +15\n- Tertiary amine group: +10\n Therefore, the estimated melting point for galanthamine would be 80 + 30 + 15 + 10 = 135\u00b0C.",
