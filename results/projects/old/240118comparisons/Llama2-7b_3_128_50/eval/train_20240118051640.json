Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. Sesamolin has two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The molecular structure also includes five methoxy groups; each can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each ether. Additionally, sesamolin possesses a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",

Since there are four fluorine atoms\u2014three in the trifluoromethyl group and one directly bonded to the benzene ring\u2014it would be reasonable to estimate an increase for each. However, the presence of the trifluoromethyl group will have a more significant influence due to the cumulative effect of its three fluorine atoms. The melting point is also affected by factors such as symmetry and crystal packing efficiency; a trifluoromethyl group may decrease symmetry and disrupt efficient packing, potentially lowering the melting point. Bearing in mind these considerations and that the actual value is -49.0 \u00b0C, which suggests a net decrease from the benzene baseline, we would estimate the following effects quantitatively: Benzene base: 5.5 \u00b0C, fluorine on the benzene ring: -2 \u00b0C due to reduced molecular symmetry and efficient packing, trifluoromethyl group: -52.5 \u00b0C due to a strong cumulative effect of the three fluorines and further decrease in symmetry and packing.

The basic unit of analysis is the 1,2-propanediol moiety, which on its own exhibits intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thus increasing the melting point. Substituting hydrogen with a methoxyphenoxy group will raise the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces but will also contain aromaticity which discourages packing hence slightly lowering the melting point. A methoxy group will increase the molecular weight and volume, which might minutely raise the melting point. However, the presence of an ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) has a slight lowering effect because it does not participate in hydrogen bonding as intensely as a hydroxyl group would. Finally, the carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",

Then, we account for the following functional group effects: \n- Phenyl groups: The two phenyl rings should significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. \n- Carbonyl groups: The two carbonyl groups (one from the ketone and one from the amide) can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure as well, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl. \n- Amide linkage: The amide group also has the potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing a similar effect as the carbonyl, so around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \n- Alkenyl linkage: The presence of a double bond adjacent to a phenyl group could moderately increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at about +5 to +10\u00b0C. \nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +60 to +100\u00b0C for the phenyl groups, +40 to +80\u00b0C for the carbonyl groups, +20 to +30\u00b0C for the amide group, and +5 to +10\u00b0C for the alkenyl linkage.",

Typically, each ester group might be expected to add some increment to the melting point; however, the actual value suggests that the overall structure may not favor such an increase, potentially due to hindrance or packing effects from the large size of the molecule. On the other hand, the ethyl side chains, which are long aliphatic chains, tend to decrease the melting point by disrupting ordering in the crystalline state due to their bulkiness and flexibility. Still, they could also contribute to van der Waals interactions that might offset some melting point depression. Lastly, amide groups typically increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding capability and resonance stabilization. If each amide group adds a significant increment to the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding, then this might counterbalance the ethyl chain effects. Therefore, considering the actual value and the structure of the compound, the prediction requires adjustment. Since the actual melting point is 79.0\u00b0C, the original prediction should rather reflect the high impact of the amide groups and the overall structure, which seems to favor a higher melting point despite the presence of long ethyl chains.",

The effects of the functional groups are as follows:\n- Esters (R-COOR'): Since there are two ester groups, and each would typically increase the melting point due to polar carbonyl and alkoxy groups which can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, we can estimate an increase of approximately +40-50\u00b0C for each ester group.\n- Dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2): Tends to decrease the melting point due to its electron-donating effect that destabilizes the crystal lattice, estimate around -5\u00b0C.\n- Methoxy group (-OCH3) on the benzene ring: Increases the melting point due to its ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions, estimate around +10\u00b0C.\n- Alkene group (C=C): Usually has little effect on the melting point, estimate a change of 0\u00b0C.\nCombining these effects while acknowledging that these are rough estimates and the overall three-dimensional structure and possible intramolecular interactions could play a significant role, which is not accounted for in this simple additive model.\n- Benzene ring: 5.5\u00b0C\n- Esters: +90\u00b0C (2 x +45\u00b0C)\n- Dimethylamino group: -5\u00b0C\n- Methoxy groups: +10\u00b0C\n\nAdding these increments to the benzene base value, we get a rough estimate.",

In general, the following functional group effects can be considered for estimating the melting point: - The basic ester group (-COO-) typically raises the melting point due to polar interactions. +20\u00b0C. - Deuterium substitution (heavy hydrogen) can result in slightly higher melting points compared to hydrogen due to stronger carbon-deuterium bonds compared to carbon-hydrogen bonds. However, this effect is usually quite small, so we\u2019ll estimate a +3\u00b0C per deuterium substitution for the three positions with deuterium. As there are 9 deuterium atoms replacing hydrogen, this will be +27\u00b0C. - The double bond in an alkene can either slightly increase or decrease the melting point depending on the overall molecular symmetry and packing; in this case, it's a substituted alkene which might disrupt crystalline packing, so we'll estimate a -5\u00b0C. Using these estimates, we can predict the melting point of the non-deuterated base Methyl methacrylate, which is around 160\u00b0C.

However, since one of the hydrogen atoms is replaced by a methyl ester (\u2013COOCH3), the increase won't be as high as a carboxyl group. An ester group is less polar than a carboxylic acid, and its hydrogen bonding ability is weaker, so we could consider it having half the impact or around 20-25 degree increase. Additionally, the methyl group itself attached to the ester might have a minor influence, slightly increasing the melting point, but this is typically a small effect of a few degrees due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Combining these effects, we add the contribution of the carboxyl and ester groups to the base melting point of benzene.",
