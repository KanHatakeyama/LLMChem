A common steroid such as androstane has a melting point around 90-100\u00b0C. \n- An ethyl group might add around 5\u00b0C as it increases the molecular weight and surface area, improving the van der Waals interactions. \n- A hydroxyl group tends to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, if free to interact. However, on steroids, hydroxyl groups can be involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, limiting this effect.
