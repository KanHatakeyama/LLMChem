A common steroid such as androstane has a melting point around 90-100\u00b0C. \n- An ethyl group might add around 5\u00b0C as it increases the molecular weight and surface area, improving the van der Waals interactions. \n- A hydroxyl group tends to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, if free to interact. However, on steroids, hydroxyl groups can be involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, limiting this effect. This may add approximately 10\u00b0C. \n- A ketone, especially within the steroidal environment, can enable additional polar interactions, possibly adding around 10\u00b0C to the melting point.

Trifluridine has three fluorine substituents, resulting in a -15\u00b0C adjustment. - Deoxyribose sugar moiety might add significantly to the melting point due to increased molecular complexity and stronger intermolecular interactions.

We estimate an increase of approximately +40 \u00b0C for each ketone group, summing up to +80 \u00b0C for the two ketone groups present. \n- Ether group: Ethers slightly increase the melting point due to the additional atomic mass and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions, but the effect is less pronounced than for alcohols or acids. We estimate an increase of about +5 \u00b0C. \n- Secondary alcohol group: This group can form hydrogen bonds, leading to a significant increase in the melting point.

Quantitatively, each ester side chain with its conjugation can be estimated to raise the melting point by about +60 to +80 \u00b0C. The butenyl groups due to their larger molecular weight and increased London dispersion forces could add an extra +10 \u00b0C each.

However, these bulky groups can also disrupt crystal lattice packing and symmetry, which generally lowers the melting point. Esters can have a variable effect on melting point because while they add to molecular weight, they can also disrupt crystalline ordering due to their less rigid structure. Thioethers slightly increase melting point due to polarity. The disruptive influence of the butanoyloxymethyl and ester groups on the crystal lattice is underestimated. Taking into account the actual melting point, the combined effects of these groups result in a substantial decrease in melting point rather than the increase or minor decrease initially predicted.

The combined effects of these groups must be quantitatively evaluated against a simple reference structure such as benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The structural features and their corresponding adjustments are as follows:\n- Amide groups (CONH): Amide groups are capable of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the melting point. Given that hydrogen bonding makes these molecules stick tightly together, the contribution might be somewhat overestimated if we don't consider the efficiency of the packing. An estimated adjustment of +30\u00b0C per amide group might be more accurate.\n- Ether groups (COC): The ether groups have a moderate effect on the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions. A modest increase of +5\u00b0C per ether group is reasonable.\n- Aromatic rings: Additional rings add planarity and facilitate \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, improving crystal packing. Nevertheless, the contribution per ring could be less than earlier considered due to steric hindrance between bulky substituents, leading to a less optimal packing. An estimation of +15\u00b0C per additional aromatic ring is a conservative approach.\n- Hydroxyl group (OH) attached to the aromatic ring: This group can participate in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, but steric factors might limit its effect. Assigning a melting point increase of +30\u00b0C can account for such interactions.\n- Bulky groups (tert-butyl group): These can disrupt crystal packing and could marginally decrease the melting point, although they also increase the molecular weight, which usually increases the melting point. A net adjustment of 0\u00b0C is considered, assuming these effects cancel each other out.\nThe sum of these adjustments should provide a more sensible prediction of the compound's melting point, avoiding the overestimation seen in the initial approach.",

A reasonable estimation is +80 degrees Celsius from a base molecule without it.\n- Cyano group (\u2013C\u2261N): Polar cyano groups can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, albeit weaker than those involving overtly polar groups such as hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. This can reasonably add around +15 to the baseline.\n- Imidazole ring: The aromatic nature of the imidazole ring, coupled with the presence of nitrogen atoms able to engage in hydrogen bonding, can result in stronger intermolecular forces attributed to \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen bonding. This could contribute an additional +25 to the melting point.\n- Methylated thiol group (\u2013SCH3): Thiols usually have weaker van der Waals forces than alcohols, but the addition of the methyl group does slightly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals interactions. This could contribute +5.\n- Amine groups: They can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, although less extensive than thioureas. This could reasonably add another +15 to the melting point.\nTaking benzene as the reference baseline (with a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius) and adding the estimated contributions from the functional groups, we should arrive at a predicted melting point for Cimetidine.",

The basic structure is a tricyclic system which usually contributes to a high melting point due to rigid structure. This can start with a reference point of naphthalene, a simpler bicyclic aromatic compound, which has a melting point of around 80. Adding more rings typically increases the melting point, so the tricyclic structure could add approximately +30 to the melting point. The compound also has an ether functional group (\u2013O\u2013), three of them, which generally have minor influence on the melting point but can contribute +5 for each due to their polar nature and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions. The tertiary amine (\u2013N(C)\u2013) can have variable effects on the melting point due to its potential for hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions. We might estimate this group could contribute +10. Altogether, the cumulative effect of the functional groups can be estimated quantitatively as follows:\n- Basic tricyclic structure: +30\n- Three ether groups: 3 * +5 = +15\n- Tertiary amine group: +10\n Therefore, the estimated melting point for galanthamine would be 80 + 30 + 15 + 10 = 135\u00b0C.",
