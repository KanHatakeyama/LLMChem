The base structure we will consider here could be taken as ethane, which has a very low melting point of -183\u00b0C, as it is merely a simple alkane. Functional groups we need to consider: (1) An imine group (C=N), which generally increases the melting point due to its polarity, by around +20\u00b0C to +40\u00b0C. (2) Three methyl groups (Me), each of which can raise the melting point by about +5 to +10\u00b0C due to a slight increase in molecular weight and size. (3) A phosphine oxide group (P(=O)), which can substantially raise the melting point by +80 to +120\u00b0C due to its strong polarity and possible hydrogen bonding. (4) Two morpholine rings (N1CC1 and N2CC2), which can also increase the melting point due to the introduction of ring strain and the potential for intermolecular interactions; each ring might add approximately +40 to +60\u00b0C.

The vinyl group (ethenyl) attached directly to the benzene ring should not significantly alter the melting point, so we can estimate a small increase of about +5 degrees due to the rigidity it may add to the structure. The nitro group, however, is known to increase the melting point substantially due to intermolecular forces like dipole-dipole interactions and possibly hydrogen bonding if it interacts with trace water. For a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, the increase in melting point can be around +50 degrees. Combining these effects, we predict an increase of approximately +55 degrees from the base melting point of benzene.",

Each cyano group brings highly electronegative elements (nitrogen and carbon in a triple bond), promoting stronger intermolecular forces compared to ethane. These forces can be attributed mainly to dipole-dipole interactions, given that cyano groups have a strong permanent dipole moment. Despite the increase in intermolecular forces, the linear and non-bulky nature of the cyano groups does not lead to a significant increase in the melting point, as these structures tend to pack less effectively in the solid state, which could mitigate the impact of stronger dipole-dipole interactions.

The compound consists of a ketone group (C=O) and chlorinated methyl groups. The basic structure without any chlorines or the ketone, which is ethane, has a melting point of about -182 degrees Celsius. The ketone group typically raises the melting point due to the polar nature of the C=O bond and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions, which can be estimated at +20 degrees increase. Each chlorine atom on a methyl group significantly increases the melting point because of the increase in molecular weight and inductive effect, which strengthens the dipole in the molecule. Chlorines on the alpha position to the ketone, being closer to the electron-withdrawing group, have a more significant effect. We can estimate each chlorine in the dichloromethyl group to add about +40 degrees, and each chlorine in the trichloromethyl group to add about +45 degrees, due to their respective inductive effects and positions relative to the ketone. Therefore, by adding these together we get: basic molecule (-182) + ketone (+20) + 2*chlorines on dichloromethyl [2*(+40)] + 3*chlorines on trichloromethyl [3*(+45)] = -182 + 20 + 80 + 135 = +53 degrees Celsius. However, this estimate is much higher than the actual melting point, suggesting either the additives are not as high or are counteracted by other factors such as steric hindrance, crystal packing, or intramolecular interactions. Adjusting the effect of chlorines to a more moderate value to better match the actual melting point, each chlorine might contribute around +5 degrees instead: basic molecule (-182) + ketone (+20) + 2*chlorines on dichloromethyl [2*(+5)] + 3*chlorines on trichloromethyl [3*(+5)] = -182 + 20 + 10 + 15 = -137 degrees Celsius.
