Butyl acetate, a smaller ester, has a melting point around -73\u00b0C which helps to illustrate how the ester linkage affects melting points. The long decyl chain increases the van der Waals forces which should elevate the melting point compared to smaller esters. Decane, a similar length alkane, melts at about -30\u00b0C. Therefore, the acetyl group might slightly increase the melting point by about 5\u00b0C due to slight dipole interactions and carbonyl stacking, while the decyl group increases it by another 15\u00b0C due to increased van der Waals interactions in comparison to decane.",
