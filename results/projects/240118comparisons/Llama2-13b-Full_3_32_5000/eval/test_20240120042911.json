We estimate an increase of approximately +40 \u00b0C for each ketone group, summing up to +80 \u00b0C for the two ketone groups present. \n- Ether group: Ethers slightly increase the melting point due to the additional atomic mass and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions, but the effect is less pronounced than for alcohols or acids. We estimate an increase of about +5 \u00b0C. \n- Secondary alcohol group: This group can form hydrogen bonds, leading to a significant increase in the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +40 \u00b0C. \n- Phenyl groups: Each additional aromantic ring increases the melting point due to enhanced \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and van der Waals forces, which increase the rigidity and stacking ability of the molecule. We estimate an increase of +20 \u00b0C for each additional phenyl ring beyond the first, adding +40 \u00b0C for the two additional rings present.\nBy summing the contributions of each group, we predict a melting point of 5.5 (baseline benzene) + 80 (ketone groups) + 5 (ether group) + 40 (secondary alcohol) + 40 (phenyl rings) = 170.5 \u00b0C.
