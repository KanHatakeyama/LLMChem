Starting with a basic linear alkane as the simplest organic substance, which has a very low or even negative melting point, the introduction of functional groups and branching can increase the melting point. However, when functional groups like ethers (R-O-R') and tertiary amines (R3N) are present, they often result in lower melting points compared to the corresponding alcohols or primary/secondary amines, respectively, due to the inability to hydrogen bond with themselves. Both ether and tertiary amine groups reduce intermolecular forces, resulting in a decreased melting point. In this case, bis(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl) ether has both ether and tertiary amine groups, which suggests a significantly reduced melting point. Since no numbers are provided for the basic units or the individual groups, including the linear portions versus branching, precise quantitative effects cannot be specified without additional data.",

For the sake of an illustrative prediction, we might assign: \n\n- Amide group: +120 degrees Celsius (significant potential for hydrogen bonding) \n- Nitro group: +75 degrees Celsius (due to electron-withdrawing effects and resonance stabilization) \n\nSumming these estimated contributions to the basic benzene unit gives us an estimated melting point.",

However, since this is a trans-configuration, there might be some kind of stabilization due to the rigidity of the molecule, but not enough to increase the melting point significantly. We can estimate this effect to be approximately -60 degrees Celsius. The hydroxy group generally increases the melting point because of the increased capacity for hydrogen bonding, but since proline already has a secondary amine and a carboxyl, the additional hydroxy won't increase the melting point as much as it would on a non-functionalized alkane.
