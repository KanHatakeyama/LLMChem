Various functional groups have the following impacts on the melting point: -OH (hydroxy) groups typically increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which could be approximately +40 for each hydroxy. -OCO- (ester) groups can also increase melting point because of the dipoles they introduce, and this can be estimated at +20. A benzyloxy group (Ph-CH2-O-) will also affect the melting point, largely due to an increase in molecular mass and van der Waals forces, which we can estimate as +10. Each additional ring structure, such as those in steroids or other rigid systems, contribute significantly to the melting point due to the ordered packing it can provide; each additional ring beyond the first can approximately increase melting point by +5. In this molecule, due to the presence of multiple rings fused together, we could estimate an addition of about +50 for the steroid nucleus. Cyclic systems often have a higher melting point than acyclic analogs due to their symmetry and the efficient packing in the crystal lattice. The 2-methylpropanoate side chain increases the molecular weight and slight steric hindrance which also might contribute to an increased melting point, we could estimate this at +5.

However, the methyl group attached to the chlorine will not significantly change the melting point since its effect is quite small in the context of melting points. Additionally, the steric strain of the cyclopropane ring is already quite high and the addition of the chloromethyl group contributes minimally to this factor.

Acetic acid has a melting point of about 16\u00b0C, primarily due to hydrogen bonding in the dimeric form. However, in decyl acetate, the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds is lost due to the ester linkage, which should significantly lower the melting point. Butyl acetate, a smaller ester, has a melting point around -73\u00b0C which helps to illustrate how the ester linkage affects melting points. The long decyl chain increases the van der Waals forces which should elevate the melting point compared to smaller esters. Decane, a similar length alkane, melts at about -30\u00b0C. Therefore, the acetyl group might slightly increase the melting point by about 5\u00b0C due to slight dipole interactions and carbonyl stacking, while the decyl group increases it by another 15\u00b0C due to increased van der Waals interactions in comparison to decane.",
