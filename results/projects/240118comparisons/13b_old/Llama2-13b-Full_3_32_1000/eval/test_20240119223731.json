Starting with benzene, with a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we estimate the effects of the following functional groups and structural elements on the melting point of Phenprocoumon: \n- Benzene ring: We start with 5.5 \u00b0C for the basic benzene unit. \n- Ketone groups: Ketones typically increase the melting point due to the ability of the carbonyl group to participate in dipole-dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bond with other molecules. We estimate an increase of approximately +40 \u00b0C for each ketone group, summing up to +80 \u00b0C for the two ketone groups present. \n- Ether group: Ethers slightly increase the melting point due to the additional atomic mass and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions, but the effect is less pronounced than for alcohols or acids. We estimate an increase of about +5 \u00b0C. \n- Secondary alcohol group: This group can form hydrogen bonds, leading to a significant increase in the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +40 \u00b0C. \n- Phenyl groups: Each additional aromantic ring increases the melting point due to enhanced \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and van der Waals forces, which increase the rigidity and stacking ability of the molecule. We estimate an increase of +20 \u00b0C for each additional phenyl ring beyond the first, adding +40 \u00b0C for the two additional rings present.\nBy summing the contributions of each group, we predict a melting point of 5.5 (baseline benzene) + 80 (ketone groups) + 5 (ether group) + 40 (secondary alcohol) + 40 (phenyl rings) = 170.5 \u00b0C.

The carbamate group (-NHC(=O)O-) contributes significantly to both hydrogen bonding and polarity, similar to amide groups\u2019 effect on melting point; this could be estimated as an increase of +120\u00b0C. The isopropyl group, being branched, reduces melting point by decreasing crystal packing efficiency; however, this group also contributes to the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which may lessen the decrease as the compound remains bulky but less ordered.
