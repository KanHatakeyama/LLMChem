The other functional group is the aldehyde (carbonyl group). The carbonyl group generally increases the melting point due to its polar nature and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions, which are typically stronger than the van der Waals forces in nonpolar compounds. Estimating the effect of the carbonyl group is challenging without experimental data, but we can assume it is significant.

Looking at common trends: \n- Basic steroid structure exhibits a relatively high melting point due to the rigid and planar four-fused ring system, which facilitates intermolecular interactions. A common steroid such as androstane has a melting point around 90-100\u00b0C. \n- An ethyl group might add around 5\u00b0C as it increases the molecular weight and surface area, improving the van der Waals interactions. \n- A hydroxyl group tends to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, if free to interact. However, on steroids, hydroxyl groups can be involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, limiting this effect. This may add approximately 10\u00b0C. \n- A ketone, especially within the steroidal environment, can enable additional polar interactions, possibly adding around 10\u00b0C to the melting point. However, within the steroidal environment, these effects might be subdued due to restricted access, considering the ketone is within the fused ring system. \nTaking into account the above functional group effects and base steroid melting point: 90 (base steroid) + 5 (ethyl) + 10 (hydroxyl) + 10 (ketone) gives us an estimated melting point.",

Therefore, we sum up the contributions: 5.5 (benzene) + 40 (cyano) + 40 (carbonyl) = 85.5 \u00b0C. After considering the combined effects, we realize that our initial estimates were significantly off, as the actual value is 32.5 \u00b0C. It seems that the overall effect of the functional groups contributes less to the melting point than initially predicted, probably due to a balance between the linear shape of the nitrile reducing van der Waals interactions and dipole interactions not being as strong as estimated for the cyano and carbonyl groups in this molecular arrangement.",
