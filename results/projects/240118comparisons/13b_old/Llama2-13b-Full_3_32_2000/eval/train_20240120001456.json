The sulfonamide group significantly influences the melting point because of its large structure and ability to engage in extensive hydrogen bonding.

Zipeprol contains several functional groups that will affect its melting point: two phenyl groups, two ether linkages (each involving one oxygen atom), a tertiary amine, and an alcohol group. Typically, phenyl groups increase the melting point due to enhanced pi-pi interactions and increased molecular rigidity; we approximate this increase at about +15\u00b0C for each phenyl group. The ether oxygen atoms contribute to the polarity and can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, potentially raising the melting point by about +5\u00b0C for each ether linkage. The tertiary amine has a negligible effect on the melting point due to the lack of significant hydrogen bonding capability, so we assign it 0\u00b0C. The alcohol group, however, can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which are strong and significantly increase the melting point; we estimate this increase to be about +40\u00b0C.
