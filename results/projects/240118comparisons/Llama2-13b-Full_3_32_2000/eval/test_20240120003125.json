We estimate an increase of approximately +40 \u00b0C for each ketone group, summing up to +80 \u00b0C for the two ketone groups present. \n- Ether group: Ethers slightly increase the melting point due to the additional atomic mass and the possibility of dipole-dipole interactions, but the effect is less pronounced than for alcohols or acids. We estimate an increase of about +5 \u00b0C. \n- Secondary alcohol group: This group can form hydrogen bonds, leading to a significant increase in the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +40 \u00b0C. \n- Phenyl groups: Each additional aromantic ring increases the melting point due to enhanced \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and van der Waals forces, which increase the rigidity and stacking ability of the molecule.

However, these bulky groups can also disrupt crystal lattice packing and symmetry, which generally lowers the melting point.

Thioethers slightly increase melting point due to polarity. The disruptive influence of the butanoyloxymethyl and ester groups on the crystal lattice is underestimated.
