We can estimate this increase to be around 70-80\u00b0C. Furthermore, the additional phenyl group contributes to the molecule's rigidity and can lead to stronger \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. Such an aromatic ring could increase the melting point by another 30-40\u00b0C. The acetyl group attached to the benzene ring can also affect the melting point through its polar carbonyl bond, causing dipole-dipole interactions; however, its effect might be less pronounced in the presence of the more significant amide group, so it might contribute an additional 10-20\u00b0C.
