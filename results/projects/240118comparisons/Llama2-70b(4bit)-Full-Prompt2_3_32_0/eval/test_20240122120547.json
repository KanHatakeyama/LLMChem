Looking at common trends: \n- Basic steroid structure exhibits a relatively high melting point due to the rigid and planar four-fused ring system, which facilitates intermolecular interactions. A common steroid such as androstane has a melting point around 90-100\u00b0C. \n- An ethyl group might add around 5\u00b0C as it increases the molecular weight and surface area, improving the van der Waals interactions. \n- A hydroxyl group tends to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, if free to interact. However, on steroids, hydroxyl groups can be involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, limiting this effect. This may add approximately 10\u00b0C. \n- A ketone, especially within the steroidal environment, can enable additional polar interactions, possibly adding around 10\u00b0C to the melting point. However, within the steroidal environment, these effects might be subdued due to restricted access, considering the ketone is within the fused ring system. \nTaking into account the above functional group effects and base steroid melting point: 90 (base steroid) + 5 (ethyl) + 10 (hydroxyl) + 10 (ketone) gives us an estimated melting point.",

Arguably, given the large number of tert-butyl groups, and the absence of functional groups that can strongly interact (such as OH or NH2), a large depression in melting point is expected.

Each additional methylene group (CH2) added to the chain typically raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. The effect of each CH2 group can be estimated to contribute around +5 degrees Celsius to the melting point. As there are 22 additional methylene groups in tricosane compared to methane, the increase in melting point would be 22 * 5 = 110 degrees Celsius. Thus, the predicted melting point would be -182 + 110 = -72 degrees Celsius. However, this calculation does not take into account that after a certain chain length the incremental increase per CH2 group likely decreases, as well as the actual conformations and the solid-state structure of long alkanes which can further influence the melting point. Therefore, a correction factor needs to be applied to account for these effects. Given that tricosane is a long alkane, the correction is significant and must bring the predicted value close to the actual melting point.",

As a reference, we take cholestane, which is a saturated hydrocarbon chain that serves as the backbone for steroids and has a melting point of 80 degrees Celsius. Gamma-sitosterol has a hydroxyl group which can engage in hydrogen bonding and generally increases melting points in compounds. This functional group could contribute an addition of approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to this effect. However, this might be an underestimate given the complexity of interactions within the steroid structure. The double bond in gamma-sitosterol introduces some rigidity to the sterol structure which can potentially increase the melting point but also reduces van der Waals interactions, so we will consider a moderate effect of \u00b15 degrees Celsius. The numerous methyl groups and the extended side chain in gamma-sitosterol increase the molecular weight and the overall surface area for van der Waals interactions, which could raise the melting point of the compound. Estimate for the added methyl groups and side chain can increase the value by around +42 degrees Celsius based on an estimation of +3 to +4 degrees Celsius per additional methyl group or similar-sized alkyl group and taking into account there are at least 10 such groups when compared to cholestane.

This long straight chain provides a high degree of van der Waals interactions. Linoleic acid has two cis double bonds (cis-C=C), each of which introduces a kink in the molecule, reducing the tightness of molecular packing and lowering the melting point significantly. Each cis double bond can be estimated to lower the melting point by about 40 degrees, since unsaturation generally leads to lower melting points due to lesser intermolecular attractions. The presence of the carboxylic acid group (COOH) allows for hydrogen bonding, which would increase the melting point. However, the effect of the double bonds is stronger in this case.

These features impact the melting point as follows:\n- Thiourea group: Due to its capability to form strong hydrogen bonds both as a donor and as an acceptor, we can expect a significant increase in the melting point. A reasonable estimation is +80 degrees Celsius from a base molecule without it.\n- Cyano group (\u2013C\u2261N): Polar cyano groups can participate in dipole-dipole interactions, albeit weaker than those involving overtly polar groups such as hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. This can reasonably add around +15 to the baseline.\n- Imidazole ring: The aromatic nature of the imidazole ring, coupled with the presence of nitrogen atoms able to engage in hydrogen bonding, can result in stronger intermolecular forces attributed to \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen bonding. This could contribute an additional +25 to the melting point.\n- Methylated thiol group (\u2013SCH3): Thiols usually have weaker van der Waals forces than alcohols, but the addition of the methyl group does slightly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and slight increase in van der Waals interactions.
