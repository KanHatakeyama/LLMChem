The basic unit for our comparison will be butane, which has a melting point of -10.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and an ethyl group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a butane ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The ethyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion can significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The ethyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20\u00b0C.\n##Prediction: 125.0\n\n#Problem",
