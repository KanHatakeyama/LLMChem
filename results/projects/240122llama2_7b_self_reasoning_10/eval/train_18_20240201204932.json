However, the oxygen within the methoxy group also increases hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in ethanol, the additional oxygen atom allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methoxy group into consideration, we can predict a decrease due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone. The exact decrease can be estimated by comparing the melting point of ethanol to that of 2-methoxyethanol.",
