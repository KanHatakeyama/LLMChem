The introduction of the methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the oxygen within the methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) also increases hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in propanediol, the additional oxygen atom allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methoxy group into consideration, we can predict a decrease due to the additional hydrogen bonding potential. However, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, which should raise the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",

(2) The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.

The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of acetylpheneturide, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.\n##Prediction: 205.0\n\n#Problem",
