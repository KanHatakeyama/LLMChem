The presence of two methyl groups reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume. Each methyl group might lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The moramide group includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. The presence of a dioxane-like bridging moiety adds rigidity and estimated at +5 degrees Celsius for this structural feature.\n##Prediction: 106.0\n\n\n#Problem",
