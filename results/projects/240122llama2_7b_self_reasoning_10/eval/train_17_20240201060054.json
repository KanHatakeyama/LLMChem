            "Test (Predicted reason)": "4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethylbenzene, which has a melting point of -106.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.\n##Prediction: 105.0\n\n#Problem",
