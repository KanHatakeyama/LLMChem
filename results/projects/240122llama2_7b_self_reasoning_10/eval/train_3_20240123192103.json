The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The two benzene rings contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per ring. The tert-butyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C. Lastly, the hydrazono group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for two phenyl groups, we have +40\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +50\u00b0C, two benzene rings at +20\u00b0C each, and one tert-butyl group at +10\u00b0C.
