The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the thiosemicarbazide moiety introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.

The basic unit for this compound can be considered 3-thiosemicarbazide, which has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure and a more significant increase in molecular weight, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The thiosemicarbazide moiety introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one phenyl group, we have +20\u00b0C total (having less influence due to the complex structure), one benzyl group at +20\u00b0C (lesser than a typical alkyl group due to the absence of a hydroxyl group), and the thiosemicarbazide moiety at +30\u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system).

The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The benzoyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point. The naphthoyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.

The phenyl group in the acetamide base also contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +20.

The hydrazono-functionalities and phenyl group introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70.

The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a fluorine atom, which introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The quinoline ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The boronic acid moiety introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C.
