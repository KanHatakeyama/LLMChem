            "Test (Predicted reason)": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -97 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius.\n##Prediction: 75.0\n\nThe compound sesamolin has a melting point of 89 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in sesamolin will affect its melting point: (1) Two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. (2) Five methoxy groups; each can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. (3) Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each ether. Additionally, sesamolin possesses a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.\n\nThe pentafluoroethane has",

The presence of a nitro group (NO2) generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and electronegativity, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The fused aromatic rings in the base structure also contribute to the melting point, estimated at +25 degrees Celsius for each additional fused ring. The methoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) can increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential.

The basic unit we can compare to is 2,6-diphenyl-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in midazolam will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The moramide group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.\n##Prediction: 180.0\n\n#Problem",
