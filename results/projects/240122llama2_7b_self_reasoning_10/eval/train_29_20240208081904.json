The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The dimethylamino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. Lastly, the hydrazono-functionalities and thiadiazole ring introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for two phenyl groups, we have +40\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one dimethylamino group at +30\u00b0C, the carbonyl function at +40\u00b0C (lesser than a typical ketone due to conjugation and steric hindrance by the adjacent large groups), and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +70\u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system).

The introduction of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.

The imidazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C.
