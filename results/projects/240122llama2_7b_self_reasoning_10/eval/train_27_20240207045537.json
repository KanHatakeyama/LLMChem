The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C).\n##Prediction: 116.0\n\n\n#Problem",

The additional functional groups and structural features in 5-(4-morpholinyl)-2-nitrophenol will affect its melting point: (1) The morpholinyl group (c1cc(c(cc1N2CCOCC2))), which can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The nitro group (O[N+](=O)[O-]), which can add approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a nitro group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding; (3) The 2-nitro group (N2CCOCC2), which can add approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a nitro group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding.\n##Prediction: 125.0\n\n\n#Problem",

The basic unit for our comparison will be propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a propane ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of cyanogen, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.\n##Prediction: -96.0\n\n#Problem",
