    "Reason": "1. Fluorine substituents: The fluorine atoms increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
