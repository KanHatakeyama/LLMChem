    "Reason": "4-Ethyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an ethyl group (C1CCCC1) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The methoxy group (Oc1ccc(cc1OC)) introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The ethyl group also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point. The net effect is a decreased melting point due to the additional hydrogen bonding but a more significant increase due to the ethyl group's rigid structure.",
