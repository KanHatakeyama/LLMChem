    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, due to the presence of a piperazine ring and a methyl group. The decyl group (C10) adds approximately +20 due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The phenyl group (C6) adds approximately +20 due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The methyl group (C1) adds approximately +5 due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
