    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (toremifene) has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. Toremifene has a basic structure similar to benzene but with additional functional groups that impact its melting point. The structural components to consider are two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. Additionally, toremifene has a methoxy group, which can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each ether. The presence of a dioxane-like bridging moiety can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
