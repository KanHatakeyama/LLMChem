    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 5-iodoindole will affect its melting point: (1) The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius; (2) The phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (3) The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
