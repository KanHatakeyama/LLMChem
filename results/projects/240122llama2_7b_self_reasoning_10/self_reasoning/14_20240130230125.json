    "Reason": "1,2-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group introduces a polar carbonyl-like functionalities, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.
