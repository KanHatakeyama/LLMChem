    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)acrylic acid has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is acrylic acid, which has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their high electronegativity, raising it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. The trifluoromethyl group's effect might be around +20 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms' effect might be around +10 degrees Celsius each. The effects are additive.",
