    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-cyanopyridine has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a bromine atom and a cyano group. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a rigid structure and a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
