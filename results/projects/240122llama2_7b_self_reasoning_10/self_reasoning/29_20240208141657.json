    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces additional molecular weight and volume, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The dimethyl group introduces additional molecular weight and volume, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
