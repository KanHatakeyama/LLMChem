    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a melting point that we need to predict. Starting with the basic unit of pyrrole, which has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius, we have substantial structural components to consider. The phenyl group, when connected to a pyrrole ring, tends to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The sulfonyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the pyrrole ring itself can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
