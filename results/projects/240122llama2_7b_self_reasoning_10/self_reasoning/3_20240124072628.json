    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be phosphoric acid, which has a melting point of -11.2 degrees Celsius. The presence of three phenyl groups in tricresyl phosphate significantly increases the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the phosphate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity but a more significant decrease due to hydrogen bonding.",
