    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The chlorine atoms also increase the electronegativity, which can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The net effect should be a significant increase in the melting point.",
