    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is imidazole, which has a melting point of -15.0 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20. The imidazole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
