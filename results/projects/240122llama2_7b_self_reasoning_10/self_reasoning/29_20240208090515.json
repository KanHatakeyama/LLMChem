    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is pyrrole, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +10 \u00b0C. The pyrrole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to its small size and limited ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -5 \u00b0C.",
