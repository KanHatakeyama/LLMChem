    "Reason": "1,1-Undecan is a saturated hydrocarbon with a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be n-heptane, which has a melting point of -10.0\u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1,1-undecan will affect its melting point: (1) The presence of 11 contiguous carbon atoms increases the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, contributing approximately +100\u00b0C; (2) The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the symmetry and increasing the molecular volume, estimated at around +20\u00b0C; (3) The two phenyl groups add rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +30\u00b0C each.",
