    "Reason": "1-methyl-2-propanone, also known as methyl methoxyacetate, has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is acetone, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and increases the molecular weight, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point by approximately -5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
