    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with two fused aromatic rings, which increases the melting point due to pi-stacking interactions and rigidity; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The tertiary butyl group introduces additional molecular weight, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
