    "Reason": "1. The basic unit, heptane, has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. 2. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. 3. The butyl group introduces a larger molecular volume and steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. 4. The carboxylate group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. 5. The methyl ester group introduces a more rigid structure and reduces the melting point by approximately -5 degrees Celsius due to the loss of a hydroxyl group.",
