    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group might add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
