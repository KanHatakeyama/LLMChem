    "Reason": "2-amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The pyridine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
