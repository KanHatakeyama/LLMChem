    "Reason": "5-bromoindole has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The indole ring introduces pi-pi interactions and rigidity, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
