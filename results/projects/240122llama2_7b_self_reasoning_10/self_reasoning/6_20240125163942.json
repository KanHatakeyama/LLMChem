    "Reason": "3-methoxyphenyl groups increase the melting point due to their effect on molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each methoxy group introduces approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The phosphine group itself also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The presence of three methoxyphenyl groups raises the melting point by approximately +60\u00b0C.",
