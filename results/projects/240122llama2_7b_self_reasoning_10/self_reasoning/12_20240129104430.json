    "Reason": "1,2,3-Trinitro compounds have a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of three nitro groups. Nitro groups significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure. Each nitro group may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
