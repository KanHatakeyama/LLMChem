    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two chloromethyl groups (\u2013CH2Cl) in place of two hydrogen atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the chlorine within the chloromethyl group also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atom can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
