    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenyl can increase the melting point due to the additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and volume.",
