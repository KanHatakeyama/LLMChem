    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (Toremifene) has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, which has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methoxy group can contribute around +10 to +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the presence of a carbonyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and rigidity, estimated at around +20 to +30 degrees Celsius.",
