    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional piperidine ring and the two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The tetrahydro-functionality introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius.",
