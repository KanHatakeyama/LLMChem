    "Reason": "Zileuton is a compound with a complex structure containing multiple functional groups that can influence its melting point. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. Zileuton has a fused aromatic ring system, which typically increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. Additionally, Zileuton contains a nitro functional group, which can raise the melting point by about +50 \u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and dipole moment. The presence of a methyl group can also contribute to the melting point, although to a lesser extent. Finally, the sulfur atom in the molecule can also influence the melting point due to its higher atomic weight and potential hydrogen bonding capabilities.",
