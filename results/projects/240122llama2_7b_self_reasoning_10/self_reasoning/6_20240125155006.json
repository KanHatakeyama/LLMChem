    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a phenyl group, which increases the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point, as it increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a decreased melting point due to the combination of these two functional groups.",
