    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -97 degrees Celsius. The compound isosorbide has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +10\u00b0C for each fluorine atom. The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
