    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of d-galacturonic acid, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
