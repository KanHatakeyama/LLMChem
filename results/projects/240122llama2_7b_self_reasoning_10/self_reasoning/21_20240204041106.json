    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The chloromethyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The two chlorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each.",
