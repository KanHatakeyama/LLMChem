    "Reason": "2-chloroethyl sulfide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is ethyl sulfide, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. Additionally, the sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
