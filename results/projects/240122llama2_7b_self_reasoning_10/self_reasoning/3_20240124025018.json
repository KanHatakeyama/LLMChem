    "Reason": "1,1,1,3,3,3-hexadeutero-2-propanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the structural modifications compared to the base unit of propane. The deuterium atoms increase the molecular weight and rigidity, which can contribute to a higher melting point. Each deuterium is estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
