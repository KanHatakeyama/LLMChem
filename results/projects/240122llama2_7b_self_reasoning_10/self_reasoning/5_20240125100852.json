    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethoxysilane has a melting point of around -100\u00b0C due to the presence of three methoxy groups, which increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The propane chain contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
