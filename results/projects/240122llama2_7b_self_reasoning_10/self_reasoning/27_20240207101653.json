    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can sterically hinder the crystal lattice, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, approximately -5 degrees Celsius. The furan ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
