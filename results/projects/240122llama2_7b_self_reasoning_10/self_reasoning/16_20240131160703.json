    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of three carbonyl groups significantly increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +30 degrees Celsius.",
