    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with two fused aromatic rings, which increases the melting point due to pi-stacking interactions and rigidity; each additional fused ring can add approximately +25 \u00b0C. The molecular structure also includes two methoxy groups; each can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each ether. Additionally, the tryptamine base itself has a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a piperidine ring and the additional functional groups.",
