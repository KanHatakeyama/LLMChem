    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a basic unit of pyridine, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The bromine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with other molecules. The nitro group also contributes to the melting point due to its electron-withdrawing nature, which can increase the intermolecular interactions and rigidity. The [N+](=O)[O-] group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. The total contribution to the melting point can be estimated as follows: pyridine base (106\u00b0C), bromine (20\u00b0C), and nitro group (10\u00b0C).",
