    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The compound under consideration has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Additionally, the compound has two methoxy groups, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The compound also has one ether linkage, which can raise the melting point by approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
