    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be propane, which has a melting point of -18.7\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group and a hydroxyl group. The methyl group adds approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
