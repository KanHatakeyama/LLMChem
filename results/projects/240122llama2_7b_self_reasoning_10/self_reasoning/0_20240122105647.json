    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the melting point of benzene (5.5\u00b0C). This is due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings, which increase the molecular weight and enhance the pi-pi interactions, leading to a higher melting point.",
