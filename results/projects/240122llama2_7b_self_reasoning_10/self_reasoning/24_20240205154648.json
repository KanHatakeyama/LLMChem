    "Reason": "3-methyl-butyraldehyde oxime has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The oxime group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The aldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can form hydrogen bonds and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
