    "Reason": "Rhodanine is a heterocyclic compound with a melting point of 120-125\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for comparison can be pyridine, which has a melting point of -15.5\u00b0C. The presence of a sulfur atom in rhodanine increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the nitrogen atom in the ring introduces a lone pair of electrons, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and further increase the melting point. The sulfur atom also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential. The net effect of these structural modifications is a significant increase in melting point.",
