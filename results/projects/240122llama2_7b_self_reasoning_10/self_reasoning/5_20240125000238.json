    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl group: The 3-nitro group can increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +10\u00b0C.\nPhenyl group (2 phenyls): The two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.\nHydrazono group: The hydrazono group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.\nThiadiazole ring: The thiadiazole ring can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.\nMethylene bridge: The methylene bridge can form hydrogen bonds, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
