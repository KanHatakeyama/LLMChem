    "Reason": "Perinaphthenone has a melting point of 120\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring itself contributes to a higher melting point due to its planarity and rigidity, which can increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) can also contribute to a higher melting point due to its increased molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The ketone group (\u2013CO\u2013) can also participate in dipole interactions, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
