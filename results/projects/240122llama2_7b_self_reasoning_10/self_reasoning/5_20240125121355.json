    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups (\u2013CH3) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl groups also increase the crystalline structure's rigidity, which can further contribute to the melting point. The net effect should be a raised melting point due to both molecular size and rigidity.",
