    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of two chlorine atoms increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C each. The alcohol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and lower the melting point by approximately -5 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and reduces the melting point by approximately -5 \u00b0C. The chlorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions.",
