    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
