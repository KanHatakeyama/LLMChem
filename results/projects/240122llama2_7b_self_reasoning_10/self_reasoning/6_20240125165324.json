    "Reason": "4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is piperidine, which has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C. (2) The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. (3) The phenyl group (4-chlorophenyl) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. (4) The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. Summing these modifications: Piperidine base (+106\u00b0C), one chlorine atom (+10\u00b0C), and one phenyl group (+20\u00b0C).",
