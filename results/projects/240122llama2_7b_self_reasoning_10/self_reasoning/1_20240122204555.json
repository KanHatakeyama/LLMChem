    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -109.6\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The presence of five fluorine atoms also increases the hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay between these two factors, but the fluorine atoms are expected to dominate due to their higher molecular weight and rigidity.",
