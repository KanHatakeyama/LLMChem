The additional phenyl group can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The pyrrolidinyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C.",
