    "Reason": "1,3-dianhydride compounds, such as cyanoacetamide, have a melting point influenced by functional groups and structural components. The basic unit for comparison is acetamide, which has a melting point of approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The cyano group introduces a strong dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The anhydride group (C(=O)N) creates a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -5 degrees Celsius due to decreased molecular weight and volume.",
