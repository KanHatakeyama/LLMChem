    "Reason": "3-methoxyphenyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The dioxane-like bridging moiety adds rigidity and likely contributes more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
