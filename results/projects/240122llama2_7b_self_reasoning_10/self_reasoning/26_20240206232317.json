    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two chlorine atoms increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 2 chlorines) = 20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
