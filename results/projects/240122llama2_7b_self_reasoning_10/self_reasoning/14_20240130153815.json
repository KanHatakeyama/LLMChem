    "Reason": "3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-(trifluoromethyl)propionic acid has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The fluorine substituents also increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 3 fluorines) = 45 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
