    "Reason": "2-chloro-4,6-difluoroaniline has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 4-chloroaniline, which has a melting point of -10.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of two fluorine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20.0\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5.0\u00b0C. The difluoro group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +2.0\u00b0C.",
