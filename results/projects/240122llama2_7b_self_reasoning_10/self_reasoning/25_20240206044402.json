    "Reason": "1H-carbazole has a melting point influenced by its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The carbazole structure introduces two additional phenyl rings, which significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 \u00b0C. Additionally, the tetrahydro-functionality introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +2 \u00b0C.",
