    "Reason": "1-Nitro-functionality introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. Two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the tert-butyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which raises the melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
