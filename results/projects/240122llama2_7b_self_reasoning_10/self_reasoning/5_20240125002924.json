    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The presence of three hydroxyl groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +30\u00b0C each. The ethyl group introduces a rigid structure and reduces the crystal lattice stability, estimated at around -10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of three hydroxyl groups and one carbonyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C and +20\u00b0C, respectively.",
