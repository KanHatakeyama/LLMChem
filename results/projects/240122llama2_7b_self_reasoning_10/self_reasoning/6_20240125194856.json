    "Reason": "2-hydroxyimino, 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl, and propanoic acid functionalities will contribute to the melting point. The basic unit for comparison is 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group also introduces additional molecular weight and rigidity, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The imino group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The propanoic acid functional group introduces additional molecular weight and rigidity, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
