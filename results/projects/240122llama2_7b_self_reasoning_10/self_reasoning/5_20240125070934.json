    "Reason": "4-cyano-4'-n-heptyloxybiphenyl has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a heptyloxy group and a cyano group. The heptyloxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
