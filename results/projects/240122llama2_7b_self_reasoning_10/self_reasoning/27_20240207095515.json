    "Reason": "1-chlorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
