    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The phthalate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
