    "Reason": "1-oxoindane has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the indane ring, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of a carboxylic acid group can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but it will also increase the crystal lattice stability, which might raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
