    "Reason": "Zileuton is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, which can affect its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is the pyridine ring, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in zileuton will affect its melting point: (1) The ketone group (C(=O)O) can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions; (2) The nitro group (NO2) can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding; (3) The methyl group (CH3) can lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduced molecular weight and increased van der Waals interactions; (4) The sulfur atom (S) can also lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
