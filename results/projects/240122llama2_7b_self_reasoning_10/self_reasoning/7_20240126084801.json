Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, which raises the melting point. The fluorenyl group itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and increased molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
