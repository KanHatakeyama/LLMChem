    "Reason": "2,6-dibromotoluene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. Starting with the basic unit of toluene, which has a melting point of -10.5 \u00b0C, we have the bromine atoms, which increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. Each bromine atom can raise the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. Additionally, the presence of two methyl groups can contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C each.",
