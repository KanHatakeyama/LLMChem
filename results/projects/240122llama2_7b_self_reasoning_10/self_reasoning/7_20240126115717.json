    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-chloroaniline has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom also contributes to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C.",
