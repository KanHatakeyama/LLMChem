    "Reason": "Benzoic acid, 3,5-dinitro-, methyl ester contains a carboxylic acid group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a hydroxyl group. The nitro groups can also increase the melting point due to their electron-withdrawing nature, which can increase the molecular weight and reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors. The methyl ester group can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a hydrophobic group.",
