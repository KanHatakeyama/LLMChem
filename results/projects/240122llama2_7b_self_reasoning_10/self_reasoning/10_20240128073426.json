    "Reason": "4-iodobenzylamine has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group, an amine group, and an iodine atom. The phenyl group adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The amine group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, which raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C.",
