    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-chloroaniline has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1-chloro-2-propanol, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom also contributes to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group, raising it by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2-bromo-4-chloroaniline will affect its melting point: (1) The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. (2) The chlorine atom also contributes to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group, raising it by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
