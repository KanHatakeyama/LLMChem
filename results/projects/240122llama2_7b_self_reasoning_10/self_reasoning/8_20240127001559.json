    "Reason": "3,5-dichlorophenol has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, contributing approximately +5 \u00b0C.",
