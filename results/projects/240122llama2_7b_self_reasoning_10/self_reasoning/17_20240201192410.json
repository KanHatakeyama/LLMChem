    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups and one methyl group in the molecule increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group can contribute around +20\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The piperazine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C.
