    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces additional molecular weight, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius.",
