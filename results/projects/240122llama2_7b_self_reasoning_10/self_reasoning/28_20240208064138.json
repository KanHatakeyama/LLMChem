    "Reason": "1,1'-biphenyl base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl rings. Each phenyl group can contribute approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The diacetate group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of two carbonyl groups, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
