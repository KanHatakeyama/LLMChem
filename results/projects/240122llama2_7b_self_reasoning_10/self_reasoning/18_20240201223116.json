    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each additional pi-system component. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5 \u00b0C. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups in indole-3-ol acetate will increase the melting point due to the additional rigid structures and hydrogen bonding potential.",
