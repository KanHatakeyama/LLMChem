    "Reason": "4-ethoxyphenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant increase due to the electronegativity and rigidity it brings, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C. The ethoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 to +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a strong hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C. The presence of three fluorine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +10 to +20\u00b0C each.",
