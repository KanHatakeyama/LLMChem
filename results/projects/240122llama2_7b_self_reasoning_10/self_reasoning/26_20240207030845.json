    "Reason": "4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The allyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The allyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
