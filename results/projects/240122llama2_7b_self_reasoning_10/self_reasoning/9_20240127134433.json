    "Reason": "2,2'-Bis(2-bromo-3-phenylpropyl)-4,4',7,7,7',7'-hexamethyl-2,2'-bi(bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)-3,3'-dione has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 3-phenylpropane, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ring introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The dione functional group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
