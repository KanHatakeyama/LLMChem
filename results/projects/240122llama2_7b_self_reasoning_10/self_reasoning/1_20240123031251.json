    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is toluene, which has a melting point of 35.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The nitro functional group, which is present three times, significantly increases the melting point due to the dipole moment and the potential for hydrogen bonding. Each nitro group can be estimated to add approximately +50\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring creates a rigid structure, which can contribute to the melting point.",
