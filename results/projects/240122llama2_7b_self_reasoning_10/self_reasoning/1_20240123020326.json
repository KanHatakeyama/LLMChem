    "Reason": "2-Aminopropane has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an amino group (NH2) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the amino group also introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a raised melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and size but a decreased melting point due to the hydrogen bonding potential.",
