    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the lauramide structure introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C each.",
