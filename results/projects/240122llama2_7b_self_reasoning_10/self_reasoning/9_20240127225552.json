    "Reason": "2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)phenol has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The pyrrolidinyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
