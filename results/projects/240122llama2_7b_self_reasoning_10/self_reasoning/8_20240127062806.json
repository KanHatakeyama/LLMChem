    "Reason": "1. Torasemide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5\u00b0C.",
