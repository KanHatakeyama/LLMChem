    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is piperazine which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group generally lowers the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -10\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenol group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.
