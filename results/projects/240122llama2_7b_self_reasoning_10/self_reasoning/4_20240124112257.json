    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for our comparison will be erythromycin, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). 2. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a 14-membered polycyclic ring system, which significantly increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the methyl group in the molecule can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduction in molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding site.",
