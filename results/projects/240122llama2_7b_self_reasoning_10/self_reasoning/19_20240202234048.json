    "Reason": "4'-(methylthio)acetophenone has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The methylthio group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, contributing around +10 to +20\u00b0C. The methyl group can also increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at about +5 to +10\u00b0C. The acetophenone group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
