    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The acetamide group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The trichloromethyl group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
