    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces a rigid structure, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The aniline ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The chlorine and fluorine atoms increase the melting point due to the presence of polar functional groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions. The aniline ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C.",
