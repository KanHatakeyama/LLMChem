    "Reason": "2,5-dinitrophenol has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 2,5-dinitrophenol, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The presence of two nitro groups significantly increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each nitro group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 50 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (50 degrees Celsius x 2 nitroses) = 100 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the phenol group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
