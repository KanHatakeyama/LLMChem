    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group that increases intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the aniline ring introduces two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
