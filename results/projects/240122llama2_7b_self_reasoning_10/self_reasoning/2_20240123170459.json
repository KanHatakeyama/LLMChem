    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison can be succinic acid, which has a melting point of 120\u00b0C. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each. The carboxyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
