    "Reason": "1,3-propanedithiol has a melting point of -120.0 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom in the thiol group can form strong hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules, which can increase the melting point. Each sulfur atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 2 sulfur atoms) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
