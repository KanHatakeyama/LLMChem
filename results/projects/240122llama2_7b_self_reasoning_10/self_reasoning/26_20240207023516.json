    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two additional phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20\u00b0C due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
