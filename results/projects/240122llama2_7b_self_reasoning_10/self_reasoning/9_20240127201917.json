    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a chlorine atom, which introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the molecular structure includes two fused aromatic rings, which would notably augment the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
