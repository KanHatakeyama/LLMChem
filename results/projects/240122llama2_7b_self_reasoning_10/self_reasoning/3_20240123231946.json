    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is acetate, which has a melting point of -114.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a hexyl group (C6H13) can significantly increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. Each hexyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (20 degrees Celsius x 1 hexyl group) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
