    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with three methoxyphenoxy groups, which increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methoxy group raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
