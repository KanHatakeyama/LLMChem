    "Reason": "1-oxoindane has a melting point of around 106 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be indane, which has a melting point of 3.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of one additional phenyl ring and one carboxylic acid group. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
