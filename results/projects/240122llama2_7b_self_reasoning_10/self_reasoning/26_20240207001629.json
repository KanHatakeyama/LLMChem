    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalene ring introduces two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius.",
