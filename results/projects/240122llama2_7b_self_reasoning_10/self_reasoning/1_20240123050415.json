    "Reason": "1R-3-oxoindane-1-carboxylic acid has a melting point of 100.5 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of -16.6 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a carboxylic acid group generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The oxo group (O=C(O)) can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity, which can add around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methyl group (C2) can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to increase the molecular volume and rigidity, which can add around +10 degrees Celsius. Summing up these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
