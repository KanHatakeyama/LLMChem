    "Reason": "1-pyrrolidinyl substitution tends to increase the melting point compared to phenol, as it creates a more rigid structure with a higher melting point. The additional functionalities in the pyrrolidinyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The pyrrolidinyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point increase. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The effects are additive.",
