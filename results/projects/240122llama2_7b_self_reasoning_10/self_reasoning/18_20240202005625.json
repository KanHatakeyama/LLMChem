    "Reason": "2-chloroethyl sulfide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of ethyl vinyl ether, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is ethyl vinyl ether, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The 2-chloro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom also introduces a rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
