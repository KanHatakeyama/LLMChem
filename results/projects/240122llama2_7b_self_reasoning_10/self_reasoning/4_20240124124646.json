    "Reason": "1-chloro-2-(1-methylethyl)benzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is ethylbenzene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and electronegativity, which raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. (2) The methyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increasing the molecular volume and rigidity. (3) The 1-methylethyl group (\u2013C(=E)\u2013) adds approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increasing the molecular volume and rigidity. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
