    "Reason": "1,3-propanedione has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The prop-2-enoate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can form hydrogen bonds and increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
