    "Reason": "4-chlorophenyl is a functional group that can increase the melting point due to the presence of a chlorine atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a hydrogen bonding network, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The piperidine ring can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
