    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The indole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one iodine atom and one indole ring, we have +50\u00b0C total (lesser due to the complex structure) and +70\u00b0C total (including the effect of additional rigid structures). This totals to an adjusted predicted increase of +120\u00b0C.",
