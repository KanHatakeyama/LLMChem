    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The presence of four methoxy groups can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +80\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C.",
