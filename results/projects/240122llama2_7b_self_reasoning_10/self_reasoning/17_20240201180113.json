    "Reason": "4-Methoxybenzylidene group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The oxazole ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight, van der Waals forces, and rigid structures.",
