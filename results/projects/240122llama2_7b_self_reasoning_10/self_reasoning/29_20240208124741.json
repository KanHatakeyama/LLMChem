    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the compound has a methoxy group, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The compound also has a nitro group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius due to the significant dipole moment it introduces. The presence of a dioxane-like bridging moiety can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius for this structural feature.",
