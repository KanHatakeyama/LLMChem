    "Reason": "1,3,4-Oxadiazole ring: The oxadiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for this structural feature. Naphthyl groups: Two naphthyl rings can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each naphthyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
