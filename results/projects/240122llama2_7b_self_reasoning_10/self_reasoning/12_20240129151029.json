    "Reason": "1,1'-phenyl-2-propanol has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group and a methoxy group. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +5\u00b0C.",
