    "Reason": "3-Amino-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazole has a melting point that we can compare to 1-chlorobenzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a 4-chlorophenyl group, which introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
