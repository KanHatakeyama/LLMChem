    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison can be butane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the heptanoate group (\u2013COO\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The heptanoate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. The methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions but a more significant decrease due to the additional hydrogen bonding.",
