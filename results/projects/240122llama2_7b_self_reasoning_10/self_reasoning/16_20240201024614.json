    "Reason": "1,2-dihydroacenaphthylen-5-yl and phenyl groups both contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C for each additional fused aromatic ring and +30\u00b0C for the methoxy group. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The quinoxaline base itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
