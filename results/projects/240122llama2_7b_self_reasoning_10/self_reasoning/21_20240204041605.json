    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The molecular structure also includes one methoxy group; this raises the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each ether. Additionally, chlorohydroquinone possesses a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
