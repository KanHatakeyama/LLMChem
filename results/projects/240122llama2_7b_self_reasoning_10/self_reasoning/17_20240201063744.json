    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group also introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
