    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 3-indole, which has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group adds rigidity and molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
