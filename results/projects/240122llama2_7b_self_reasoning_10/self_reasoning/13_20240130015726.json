    "Reason": "1,1'-Physostigmine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be the piperidine ring, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The introduction of the methoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) and the phosphate group (PO4) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The phosphate group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
