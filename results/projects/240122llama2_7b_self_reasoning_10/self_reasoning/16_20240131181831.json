    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbamate and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The basic unit for this compound can be considered piperazine which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C). Additionally, Voriconazole has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including a 1,1'-carbamate group, a methylenepiperidine moiety, and a fluorine atom. The carbamate group can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methylenepiperidine moiety may also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The fluorine atom can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
