    "Reason": "3,3,3-trifluoro-N-(1-methylpropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison can be propane, which has a melting point of -18.7\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group (CF3) increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The methyl group (CH3) adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The fluorine atoms (F) in the trifluoromethyl group and the methyl group increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C each due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group. The nitrogen atom (N) in the amide group (C(=O)NC(C)CC) adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a rigid structure. The carbonyl group (C(=O)O) adds approximately +30\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group. The trifluoromethyl group (CF3) in the trifluoromethyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
