    "Reason": "4-methyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide, which has a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a nitro group, which increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group (Cc1ccc(cc1[N+](=O)[O-])S(=O)(=O)N) adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N) adds approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a sulfonamide group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The nitro group (N) adds approximately +20 due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
