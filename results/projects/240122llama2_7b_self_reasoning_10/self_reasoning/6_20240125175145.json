    "Reason": "2,3,4-tribromothiophene has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of three bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per bromine atom, totaling +60\u00b0C.",
