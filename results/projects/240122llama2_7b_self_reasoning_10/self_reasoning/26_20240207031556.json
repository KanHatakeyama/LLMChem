    "Reason": "1,1-Dimethylacetamide has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is acetamide, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in n,n'-dimethylacetamide will affect its melting point: (1) Two methyl groups, which can increase the melting point by about +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
