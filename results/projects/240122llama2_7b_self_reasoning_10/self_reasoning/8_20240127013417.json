    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of -95.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The iodine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher electronegativity and the formation of iodine-containing compounds, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a slight increase due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
