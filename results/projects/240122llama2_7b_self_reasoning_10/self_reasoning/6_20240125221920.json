    "Reason": "3-amino-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be 1-phenylhydrazine, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The introduction of the 4-chlorophenyl group increases the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, contributing around +10 to +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
