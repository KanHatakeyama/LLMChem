    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the bromine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the dioxane ring, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom also increases the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the dioxane ring, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
