    "Reason": "2-fluoroquinoline base has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of a boronic acid group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
