    "Reason": "2-Methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group also introduces additional rigidity, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
