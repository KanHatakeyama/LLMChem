    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (tryptamine) has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, which has a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methoxy group might add approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the tryptamine base has a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius.",
