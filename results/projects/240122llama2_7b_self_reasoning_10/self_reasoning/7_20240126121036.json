    "Reason": "1,1,1,3,3,3-hexadeutero-2-propanone has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit, propanone, has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The presence of six deuterium atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and a slight increase in molecular weight, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
