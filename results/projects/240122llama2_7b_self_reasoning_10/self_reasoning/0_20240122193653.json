    "Reason": "Benzyl alcohol has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C. The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which generally raises the melting point. The methyl group (-CH3) is a small, non-polar group that does not significantly affect the melting point.",
