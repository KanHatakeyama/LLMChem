    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of ethanol. The basic unit for comparison is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the diphenyl group introduces pi-pi interactions, which can contribute to an increase in the melting point. Pi-pi interactions can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
