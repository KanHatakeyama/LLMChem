    "Reason": "2,4-dibromobenzene has a melting point of 78.5\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the melting point of benzene (5.5\u00b0C). The presence of two bromine atoms increases the molecular weight and introduces additional intermolecular interactions, such as dipole-dipole and dispersion forces, which contribute to the higher melting point. The bromine atoms also introduce a degree of polarity, which can enhance the melting point through increased hydrogen bonding.",
