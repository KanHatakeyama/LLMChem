    "Reason": "2-Methylaziridine has a melting point that we can compare to ethanal, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the aziridine ring introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
