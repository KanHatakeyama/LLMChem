    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The iodine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 \u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydrogen bonding potential.",
