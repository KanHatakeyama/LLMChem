    "Reason": "1,2-diols have a melting point of around -100\u00b0C. The presence of siloxane groups in dodecamethylpentasiloxane increases the melting point due to the rigid structure and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their small size and ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The siloxane groups also contribute to the melting point due to their rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
