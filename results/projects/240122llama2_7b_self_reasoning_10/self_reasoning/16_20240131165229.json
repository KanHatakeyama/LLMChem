    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.
