    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound can be ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The ethoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to its small size and limited ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -2\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion can significantly augment the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
