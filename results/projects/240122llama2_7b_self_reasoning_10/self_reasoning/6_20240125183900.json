    "Reason": "4-Fluorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The fluorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, which raises the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carboxylate group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius. The presence of two fluorine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius each.",
