    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which can significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to this value. Additionally, the dioxane-like bridging moiety can add rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius for this structural feature.",
