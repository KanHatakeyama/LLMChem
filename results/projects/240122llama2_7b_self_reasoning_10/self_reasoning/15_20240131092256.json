    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of three nitro groups significantly increases the melting point due to the ability of nitro groups to participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +50 \u00b0C for each nitro group. Additionally, the toluene ring introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for the toluene ring.",
