    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 2-nitropyridine, which has a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. (2) The nitro group introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
