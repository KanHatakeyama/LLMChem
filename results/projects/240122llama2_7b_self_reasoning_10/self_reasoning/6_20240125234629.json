    "Reason": "1,3-dianhydride compounds, such as cyanoacetamide, have a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The anhydride group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C.",
