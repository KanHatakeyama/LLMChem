    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-chloroaniline has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for this compound is 4-chlorobenzene, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. (2) The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. (3) The chlorine atom introduces a polar group, participating in hydrogen bonding and rigidifying the structure, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
