    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 2-nitropyridine, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the nitro group, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom also increases the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the nitro group, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius.",
