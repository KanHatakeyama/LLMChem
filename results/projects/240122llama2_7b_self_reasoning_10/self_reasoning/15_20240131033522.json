    "Reason": "5-Furyl substitution tends to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the presence of a bromine atom can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methylene bridge can also contribute to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The thioxo group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The dione group can also contribute to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
