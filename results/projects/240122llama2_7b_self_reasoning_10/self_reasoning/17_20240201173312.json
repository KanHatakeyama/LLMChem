    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two carbonyl groups, which generally increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Each carbonyl is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. Additionally, the tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
