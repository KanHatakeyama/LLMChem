    "Reason": "4-chlorophenyl group: The 4-chlorophenyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
