    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbamate functionalities tend to increase the melting point due to the rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
