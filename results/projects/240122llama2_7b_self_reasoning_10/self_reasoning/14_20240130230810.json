    "Reason": "1-octanamine, n-methyl-n-octyl- has a melting point that we can compare to 1-methyl-1-octanol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be 1-methyl-1-octanol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 1-octanamine, n-methyl-n-octyl-, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
