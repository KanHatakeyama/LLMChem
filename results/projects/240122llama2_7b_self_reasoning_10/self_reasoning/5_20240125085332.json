    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenyl can increase the melting point due to the additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group can lower the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -10 degrees Celsius. The acetate group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
