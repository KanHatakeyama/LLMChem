    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups and a methoxy group can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The phenyl groups can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methoxy group can add approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a methoxy group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The naphthalenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
