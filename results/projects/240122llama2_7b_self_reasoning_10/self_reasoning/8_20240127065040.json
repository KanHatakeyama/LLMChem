    "Reason": "1-oxoindane has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is indane, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The introduction of a carboxylic acid group can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. Additionally, the oxo group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
