    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which increases the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The imidazole ring also contributes to the melting point, with a value of around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
