    "Reason": "1,1-Spiro-2-benzopyran base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the additional functional groups and structural features in Spiroperone will affect its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, a methoxy group, a nitro group, and a dioxane-like bridging moiety. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The nitro group raises the melting point due to the dipole moment, estimated at around +50\u00b0C. The dioxane-like bridging moiety adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
