    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexahydro-2,3,4,5,6-pentamethyl-1,1'-biphenyl-3,3'-dione, or embelin, has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of six methyl groups, which increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +100\u00b0C. Additionally, the biphenyl moiety introduces two additional phenyl rings, which enhance the crystalline structure and increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
