    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl can increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group. The nitro group can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the phenyl group can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The acetonitrile group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
