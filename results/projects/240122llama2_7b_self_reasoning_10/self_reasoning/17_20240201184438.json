    "Reason": "1-Decanamine has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to the presence of a straight-chain decyl group. The decyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point. The amine group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
