    "Reason": "9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. Fluorenyl group itself contributes to the melting point due to its high molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +30 \u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, estimated at +40 \u00b0C. The succinimide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, estimated at +30 \u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight, van der Waals interactions, and hydrogen bonding.",
