    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a melting point that we can compare to 2-nitropyridine, which has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The pyridine ring introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
