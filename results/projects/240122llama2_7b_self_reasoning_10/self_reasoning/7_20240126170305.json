    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxyphenoxy group, which introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group also introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
