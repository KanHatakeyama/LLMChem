    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl acetonitrile has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the basic unit of acetonitrile, which has a melting point of -10.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a nitro group (NO2) generally raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The phenyl group (C6H5) can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. The estimated effect of the phenyl group is around +30 degrees Celsius. The nitro group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which may lower the melting point by around -5 degrees Celsius. The net effect is a moderate increase due to the nitro group and a more significant contribution from the phenyl group.",
