    "Reason": "1-propanol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an acetate group can increase the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
