    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with two fused aromatic rings, which increases the melting point due to pi-stacking interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +25 \u00b0C for this structural modification. Additionally, the molecular structure includes two methoxy groups, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The tryptamine base itself has a melting point around 106 \u00b0C.",
