    "Reason": "2-vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of a vinyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C.",
