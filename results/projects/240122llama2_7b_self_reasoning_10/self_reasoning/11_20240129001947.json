    "Reason": "1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The tetrazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one phenyl group, we have +20\u00b0C total (having less influence due to the complex structure), one chlorine atom at +50\u00b0C, and one tetrazole ring at +70\u00b0C. This totals to an adjusted predicted increase of +140\u00b0C.",
