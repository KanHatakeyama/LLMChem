    "Reason": "1,2,3,5-tetraiodobenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the effect of the iodine atoms. Each iodine atom adds approximately +100\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The iodine atoms also introduce a significant dipole moment, which can enhance intermolecular interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The iodine atoms also increase the molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
