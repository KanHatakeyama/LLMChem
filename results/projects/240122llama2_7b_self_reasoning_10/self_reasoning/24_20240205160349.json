    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point due to the absence of hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -2 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The furane ring itself contributes to a more rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius.",
