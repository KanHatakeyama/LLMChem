    "Reason": "1-propene, 1-chloro-, (z)- has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1-propene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The (z)-configuration also contributes to a more rigid structure, which can further increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
