    "Reason": "1-benzyloxy-3-iodobenzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The iodine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The benzene ring formation introduces additional rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for each additional methoxy group.",
