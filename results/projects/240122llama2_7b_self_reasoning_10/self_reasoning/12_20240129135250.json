    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The nitro functional group (\u2013NO2) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. Each nitro group may contribute around +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the toluene ring introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
