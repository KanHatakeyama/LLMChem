    "Reason": "1,1'-Physostigmine has a melting point of 120.5\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the base melting point of benzene (5\u00b0C). The structural modifications that contribute to this increase include the presence of a phenanthrene skeleton, which is a rigid and planar structure that enhances intermolecular interactions and increases molecular weight. Additionally, the molecule contains a nitro functional group, which introduces a strong dipole moment and increases intermolecular forces. The ketone group also contributes to the melting point through polar carbonyl interactions. The presence of a hydroxyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further enhance the melting point. However, the exact impact of each functional group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
