    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The anhydride functionalities introduce additional carbonyl interactions, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The thiadiazole ring itself can contribute approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding.",
