    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to steric hindrance. The carbonyl group introduces a polar functional group, raising the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
