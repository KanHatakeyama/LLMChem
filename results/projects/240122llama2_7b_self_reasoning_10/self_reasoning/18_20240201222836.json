    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison can be 1-methyl-4-phenylbenzene, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the methyl group (\u2013CH3) and the ethyl group (\u2013CH2CH3) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The ethyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, which raises the melting point. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, which raises the melting point. The exact impact of these structural modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. Ring formation: +35\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
