    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the structural modifications compared to benzene. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the molecular weight and rigidity, which raises the melting point by approximately +100\u00b0C. The hydroquinone group (O) introduces a melting point increase due to hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The phenyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance the crystalline structure and increase the molecular weight.",
