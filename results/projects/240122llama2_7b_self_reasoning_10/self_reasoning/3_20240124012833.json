    "Reason": "5-(4-morpholinyl)-2-nitrophenol has a melting point influenced by its functional groups compared to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit is 2-nitrophenol, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Morpholine, a polar, rigid structure, can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The morpholine ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The total effect of these functional groups is approximately +110\u00b0C.",
