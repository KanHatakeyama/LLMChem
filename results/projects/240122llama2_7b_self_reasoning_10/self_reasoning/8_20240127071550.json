    "Reason": "4'-Methylthioacetophenone has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methylthio group, which introduces a sulfur atom and a methyl group. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can also increase the melting point due to steric hindrance and molecular volume. The sulfur atom and methyl group can contribute approximately +20 and +10, respectively, to the melting point.",
