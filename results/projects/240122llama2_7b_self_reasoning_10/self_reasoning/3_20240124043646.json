    "Reason": "1,3-Carbazole has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) can lower the melting point due to reducing the molecular weight and increasing the van der Waals interactions, which can lower it by approximately -10\u00b0C. The carbazole ring itself can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
