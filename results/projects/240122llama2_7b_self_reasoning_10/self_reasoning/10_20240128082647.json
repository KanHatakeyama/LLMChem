    "Reason": "1,4-diphenylbutane-2,3-dione has a melting point that we can compare to butane, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison is butane, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
