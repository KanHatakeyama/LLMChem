    "Reason": "4-Decylphenyl and methylbenzamide have different melting points. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the phenyl group increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The decyl group (C1CCCCCCCCCC) adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methyl group (C) adds approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a methyl group, which can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding.",
