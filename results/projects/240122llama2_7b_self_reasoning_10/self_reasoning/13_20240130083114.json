    "Reason": "1,2-thiadiazole ring introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The sulfonamide group introduces a polar carbonyl-like functionalities, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70 degrees Celsius. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for three phenyl groups, we have +60\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +50\u00b0C, the carbonyl function at +30\u00b0C (lesser than a typical ketone due to conjugation and steric hindrance by the adjacent large groups), and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +40\u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system). This totals to an adjusted predicted increase of +180\u00b0C.",
