    "Reason": "2-Vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for this compound can be considered the basic benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The vinyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point. The carbonyl group introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The methoxy group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The effects are additive.",
