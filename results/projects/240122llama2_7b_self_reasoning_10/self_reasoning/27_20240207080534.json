    "Reason": "1,2,3,5-tetraiodobenzene has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The iodine atoms increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the iodine atoms also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
