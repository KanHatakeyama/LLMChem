    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the dinitro group introduces two strong withdrawing groups, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius each. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius.",
