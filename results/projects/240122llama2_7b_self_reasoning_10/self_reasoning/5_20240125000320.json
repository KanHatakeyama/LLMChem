    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point of around 106 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is piperazine, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an ethyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the ethyl group also introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius.",
