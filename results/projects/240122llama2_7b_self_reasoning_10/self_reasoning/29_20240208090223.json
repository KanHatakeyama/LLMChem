    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the piperidine ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +5\u00b0C. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The presence of two fluorine substituents increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each.",
