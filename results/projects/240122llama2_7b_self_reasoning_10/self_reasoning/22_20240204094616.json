    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The aniline ring formation introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C.",
