    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 1 fluorine) = 15 degrees Celsius.",
