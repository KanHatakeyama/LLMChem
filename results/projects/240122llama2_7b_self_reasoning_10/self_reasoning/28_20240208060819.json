    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered 2,6-diphenyl-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly augment the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably increase the melting point.",
