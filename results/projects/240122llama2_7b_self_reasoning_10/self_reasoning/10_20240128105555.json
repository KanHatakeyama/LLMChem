    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 2-nitropyridine, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. (2) The pyridine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. (3) The nitro group introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
