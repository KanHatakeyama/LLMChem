    "Reason": "1,3-Carbazole has a melting point of around 106 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group, which tends to lower the melting point due to the reduction in molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding potential. Additionally, the carbazole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
