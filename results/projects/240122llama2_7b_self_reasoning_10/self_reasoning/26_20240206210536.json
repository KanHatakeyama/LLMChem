    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of one additional phenyl ring and one iodine atom. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The iodine atom can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
