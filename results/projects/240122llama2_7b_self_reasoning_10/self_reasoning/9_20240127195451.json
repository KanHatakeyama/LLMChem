    "Reason": "1,2-diiodomethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is n-hexadecane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of 12 methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. Additionally, the siloxane structure creates a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5\u00b0C each.",
