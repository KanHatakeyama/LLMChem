    "Reason": "1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy-, tri has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 \u00b0C. The hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group (\u2013COOH) also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The presence of three tricarboxylic acid units (\u2013COOC\u2013) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +30 \u00b0C each.",
