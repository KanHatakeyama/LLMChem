    "Reason": "1,1-diethylbenzene has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly enhances the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and pi-pi interactions. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point.",
