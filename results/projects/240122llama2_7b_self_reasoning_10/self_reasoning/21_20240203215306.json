    "Reason": "5-tert-butyl-2-methyl-3-furoic acid has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky structure, which can increase the melting point due to steric hindrance and molecular weight. The carbonyl group introduces polar interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The furan ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C.",
