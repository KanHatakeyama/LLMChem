    "Reason": "Naphthalene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Naphthalene has a melting point that is significantly higher due to its rigid structure and the presence of two fused aromatic rings, which increase the melting point by approximately +25 degrees Celsius for each additional fused ring. Additionally, naphthalene has a melting point that is higher due to the presence of a nitrile group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
