    "Reason": "4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The allyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20.0 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +5.0 degrees Celsius. The allyl group also introduces additional pi-pi interactions, estimated at +10.0 degrees Celsius.",
