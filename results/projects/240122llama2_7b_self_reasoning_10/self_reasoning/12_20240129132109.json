    "Reason": "1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy-, tri has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound can be propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 \u00b0C. The presence of three carboxylic acid groups significantly increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +30 \u00b0C for each carboxylic acid. Additionally, the hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The propane-like structure also contributes to the melting point, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C.",
