    "Reason": "1,12-diaminododecane has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is dodecane, which has a melting point of around 50\u00b0C. The diamine functional group introduces two additional hydrogen bonding possibilities, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C per group. The dodecane base has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The diamine group introduces two additional hydrogen bonding possibilities, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius per group.",
