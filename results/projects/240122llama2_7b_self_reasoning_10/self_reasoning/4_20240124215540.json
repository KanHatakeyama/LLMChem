    "Reason": "1-(2-nitro),2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point. The basic unit we can compare to is 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1-(2-nitro),2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine will affect its melting point: (1) The nitro group (N) can increase the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding; (2) The two phenyl groups (C(C)C) can add roughly +20 each due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (3) The tert-butyl group (C(C)C) can add approximately +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (4) The dibenzoyl group (C(=O)N(NC(=O)c1ccccc1)C(C)(C)) can add roughly +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
