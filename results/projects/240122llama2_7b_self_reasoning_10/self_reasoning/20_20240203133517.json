    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison is a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius, which is the melting point of a melting point of a melting point of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. 2. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. 3. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. 4. The acetyl group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can form hydrogen bonds and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. 5. The alanyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. 6. The oxo group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can form hydrogen bonds and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. 7. The tetracyclo[6.6.2.0~2,7~.0~9,14~]hexadeca-2,4,6,9,11,13,15-heptaene-15,16-dicarboxylate moiety can increase the melting point due to the presence of two carbonyl groups, which can form hydrogen bonds and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
