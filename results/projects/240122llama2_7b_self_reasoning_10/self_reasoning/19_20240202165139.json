    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -97.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of four fluorine substituents significantly increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity which raises the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the fluorine substituents increase the molecular weight and size which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
