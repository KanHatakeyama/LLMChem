    "Reason": "3-methoxyphenyl groups, when connected to a phosphine base, increase the melting point due to the additional rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential. Each methoxy group can raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The phosphine base itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The presence of three methoxyphenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the additional rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential. Each methoxy group can raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
