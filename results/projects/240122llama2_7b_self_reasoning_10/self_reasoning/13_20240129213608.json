    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C. The chlorine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C each. The pentachloro group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
