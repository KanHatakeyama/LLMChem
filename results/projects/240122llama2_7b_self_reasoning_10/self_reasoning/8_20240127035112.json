    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol is a compound with a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenylmethyl group, a methoxy group, and a carbamate group. The phenylmethyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, contributing around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can form hydrogen bonds, increasing the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
