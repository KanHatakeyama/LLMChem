    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). 2. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a hydrazino group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The hydrazino group introduces a strong dipole, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, rigidifying the structure and contributing approximately +30\u00b0C. 3. The acetamide group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. 4. The 1-acetyl-2-phenylhydrazino group introduces a bulky and rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point, contributing approximately +30\u00b0C.",
