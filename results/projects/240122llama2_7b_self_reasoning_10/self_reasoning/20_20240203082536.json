    "Reason": "1,3-Benzoxazole has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. Two phenyl groups are linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the tert-butyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The benzoxazole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
