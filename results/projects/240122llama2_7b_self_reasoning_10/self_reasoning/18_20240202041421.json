    "Reason": "3-fluoro-4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide, which has a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a methoxy group, which increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The sulfonamide group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
