    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. 2. The presence of a phenyl group in the molecule increases the melting point due to the ability to enhance pi-pi interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. 3. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. 4. The propylidene group introduces a rigid structure and additional van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. 5. The hydrazono group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. 6. The phenylhydrazine group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
