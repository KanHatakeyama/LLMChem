    "Reason": "1-Chlorine and trifluoromethyl substitutions significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 3 fluorines) = 45 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
