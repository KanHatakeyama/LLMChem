    "Reason": "3-heptene has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius due to its simple structure and lack of functional groups. The basic unit we can compare to is ethene, which has a melting point of -169 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 3-heptene will affect its melting point: (1) The heptane chain adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; (2) The methyl group introduces a slight increase due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
