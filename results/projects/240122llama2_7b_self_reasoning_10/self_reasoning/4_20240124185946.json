    "Reason": "1,3-propanedinitrile, also known as methacryloyl chloride, has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is acetone, which has a melting point of -16.6 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in methacryloyl chloride will affect its melting point: (1) The chlorine atom introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. (2) The methacryloyl group introduces a rigid structure and a carbonyl functional group, which can contribute approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and potential hydrogen bonding.",
