    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The oxygen atom also introduces hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydroxyl group.",
