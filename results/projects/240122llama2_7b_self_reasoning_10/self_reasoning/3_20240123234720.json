    "Reason": "1,3-dinitrobenzene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group (-CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the nitro group (NO2) introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase intermolecular interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to molecular size and dipole interactions but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding.",
