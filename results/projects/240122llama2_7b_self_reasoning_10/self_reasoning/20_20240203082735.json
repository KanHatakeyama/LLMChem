    "Reason": "1,1'-Physostigmine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is the melting point of the piperidine ring, which is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the physostigmine structure has a fused aromatic ring system, which would notably augment the melting point.",
