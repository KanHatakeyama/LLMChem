    "Reason": "1-benzyloxy-3-iodobenzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The introduction of the iodine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of iodine-containing compounds, which have a higher melting point than hydrogen-bonded compounds. The benzyloxy group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20 \u00b0C. The iodine atom also increases the melting point due to the formation of iodine-containing compounds, estimated at approximately +10 \u00b0C.",
