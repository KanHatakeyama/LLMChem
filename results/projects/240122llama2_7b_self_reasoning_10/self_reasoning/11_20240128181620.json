    "Reason": "3-thienyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the introduction of a rigid, planar structure with potential hydrogen bonding. Each thienyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The thienyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
