    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The hydrogen chloride can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The dioxane-like bridging moiety adds rigidity, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C.",
