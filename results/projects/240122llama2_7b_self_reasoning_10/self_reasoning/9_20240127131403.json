    "Reason": "1H-Carbazole has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a tetrahydro-group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The tetrahydro-group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
