    "Reason": "3-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl isocyanate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxycarbonyl group, which can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The methoxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential for dipole interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The isocyanate group introduces a rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
