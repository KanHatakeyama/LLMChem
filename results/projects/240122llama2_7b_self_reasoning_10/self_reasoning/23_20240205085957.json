    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound can be considered cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The methyl groups (three in total) increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each methyl group may raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. Additionally, the dimethyl substitution tends to increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at around +5 \u00b0C for each methyl group.",
