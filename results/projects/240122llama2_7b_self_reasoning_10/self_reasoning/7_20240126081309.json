    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components: (1) The furanyl group (C2(C)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. (2) The isopropyl group (C(C)C) introduces a bulky side chain, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. (3) The barbituric acid moiety (C(=O)NC(=O)N) creates a rigid structure with hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
