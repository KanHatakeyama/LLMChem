    "Reason": "100 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. The exact impact of this structural modification is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, the introduction of a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
