    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two fluorine substituents increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 2 fluorines) = 30 degrees Celsius. The chlorine substituent also introduces a dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
