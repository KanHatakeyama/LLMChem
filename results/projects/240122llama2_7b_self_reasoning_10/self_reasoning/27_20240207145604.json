    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which increases the molecular weight and size, and also introduces hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The octanamide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
