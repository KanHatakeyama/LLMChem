    "Reason": "100 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and a strong dipole moment, which significantly increases intermolecular forces and melting point. The sulfur atom can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which may further lower the melting point. However, the exact impact of hydrogen bonding is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
