    "Reason": "2-bromo-2'-methoxyacetophenone has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group and a bromine atom. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The bromine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of a rigid structure, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
