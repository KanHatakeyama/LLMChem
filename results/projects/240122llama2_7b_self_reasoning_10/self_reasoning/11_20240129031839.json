    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two ethoxy groups (\u2013OCH3) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. Each ethoxy group can be estimated to add approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
