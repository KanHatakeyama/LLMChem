    "Reason": "2-fluoro-4-nitrobenzoic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 120.0 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atom introduces a significant increase due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The nitro group raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atom also introduces a significant increase due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius each.",
