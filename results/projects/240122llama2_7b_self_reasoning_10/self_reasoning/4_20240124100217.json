    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205\u00b0C due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which enhances the crystalline structure and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
