    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The piperidine ring formation also introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for two phenyl groups, we have +60\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one chlorine atom at +50\u00b0C, and the piperidine ring at +30\u00b0C.",
