    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The acetamide group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to steric hindrance.",
