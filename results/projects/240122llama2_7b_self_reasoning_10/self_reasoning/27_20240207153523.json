    "Reason": "1-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is pyrrole, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
