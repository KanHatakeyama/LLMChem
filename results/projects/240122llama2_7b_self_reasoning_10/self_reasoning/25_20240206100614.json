    "Reason": "1,4-Naphthalenediol base, with a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two fused aromatic rings, which increase the melting point due to molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. Each naphthalene ring can contribute around +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The two methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the naphthalene ring, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius for each methoxy group due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
