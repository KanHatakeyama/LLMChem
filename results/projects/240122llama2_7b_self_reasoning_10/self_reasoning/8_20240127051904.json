    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group for hydrogen bonding. The nitro group can increase the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase molecular weight. The exact impact of the phenyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can assume a moderate increase of approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential.",
