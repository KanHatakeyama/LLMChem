    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)acrylic acid has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with a melting point of approximately +20\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their high electronegativity, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
