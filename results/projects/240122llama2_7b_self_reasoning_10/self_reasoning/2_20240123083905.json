    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane has a melting point of -119.5 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and electronegativity, which raises the melting point. The fluorine also increases the molecular volume due to its larger size, further contributing to the melting point. The fluorine atom also increases the hydrogen bonding potential due to its electronegativity, which can raise the melting point. The net effect is a significant increase in the melting point due to the fluorine atom's impact on molecular weight, volume, and hydrogen bonding potential.",
