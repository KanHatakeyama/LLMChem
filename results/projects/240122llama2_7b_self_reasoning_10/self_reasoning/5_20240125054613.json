    "Reason": "5-(4-morpholinyl)-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 2-nitrophenol, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. (2) The morpholinyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. (3) The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. (4) The presence of two additional phenyl groups can contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each.",
