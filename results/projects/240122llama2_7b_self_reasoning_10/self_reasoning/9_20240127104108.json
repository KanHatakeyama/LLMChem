    "Reason": "3-methylquinoline n-oxide has a melting point that we can compare to quinoline, which has a melting point of 106.5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The nitrogen within the quinoline ring also participates in hydrogen bonding, which further lowers the melting point. The oxo group introduces additional rigidity and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group also introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The net effect is a raised melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
