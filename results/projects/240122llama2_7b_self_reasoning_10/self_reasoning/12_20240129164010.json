    "Reason": "1-oxoindane has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group and a carboxylic acid functional group. The methyl group adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The carboxylic acid group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the oxo group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
