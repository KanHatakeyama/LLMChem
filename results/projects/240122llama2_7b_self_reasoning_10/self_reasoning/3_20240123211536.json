    "Reason": "Xanthene has a melting point of 100\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications that contribute to this increase are the presence of two fused aromatic rings, which enhance the molecular rigidity and pi-pi interactions. Each additional phenyl ring can raise the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi interactions. Additionally, the ketone group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C.",
