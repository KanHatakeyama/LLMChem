    "Reason": "1,4-Naphthalenediol has a melting point of around 90 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methoxy groups (\u2013O\u2013) increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalene ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
