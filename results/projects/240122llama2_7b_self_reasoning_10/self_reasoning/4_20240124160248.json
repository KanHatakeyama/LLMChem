    "Reason": "2-ethylhexylacetate has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for analysis is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.15\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of two additional methyl groups (\u2013CH3\u2013) raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The ethyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) introduces a slight decrease due to reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The acetate group (\u2013COO\u2013) adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The presence of a methyl group (\u2013CH3\u2013) can also contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
