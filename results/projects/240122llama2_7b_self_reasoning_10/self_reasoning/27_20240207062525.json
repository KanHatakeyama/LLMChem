    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The acetate group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group within the indole ring might contribute to the melting point due to additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Finally, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
