    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two methoxy groups, which increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity they introduce. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point.",
