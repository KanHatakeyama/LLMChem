    "Reason": "1-chlorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the adjacent ethyl group, which raises it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
