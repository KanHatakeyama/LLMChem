    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, a benzyl group, a propylidine chain, and a hydrazono group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, contributing around +20 to +30\u00b0C. The propylidine chain introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 to +20\u00b0C. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C. The two phenyl rings can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
