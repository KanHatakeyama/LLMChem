    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit is imidazole, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group (C(=O)n2ccnc2) increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two imidazole rings creates a rigid structure, which enhances the crystalline structure and raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
