    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene (cis) has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be vinyl chloride, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The cis-configuration also introduces some rigidity, which might contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
