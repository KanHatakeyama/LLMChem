    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. Two phenyl groups are present, which would add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius.",
