    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two dimethylamino groups (\u2013N(CH3)2) in place of two hydrogen atoms increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the oxygen within the methoxy group also increases hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in ethanol, the additional oxygen atom allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methoxy group into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
