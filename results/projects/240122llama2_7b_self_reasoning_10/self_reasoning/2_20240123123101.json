    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its functional groups. The basic unit we can compare to is phenol, which has a melting point of around 5\u00b0C. The amino group introduces a basic nitrogen atom, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The two nitro groups contribute to a significant increase in molecular weight and dipole moment, estimated at +60\u00b0C each. The dinitro group introduces two additional nitrogen atoms, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups raises the melting point, with the amino group contributing +20\u00b0C, each nitro group contributing +60\u00b0C, and the dinitro group contributing +30\u00b0C.",
