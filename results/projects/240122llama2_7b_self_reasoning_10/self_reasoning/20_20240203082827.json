    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,1'-phenyl-2,3-diol, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the oxazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. Each methoxy group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. Each carbonyl is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20 degrees Celsius.",
