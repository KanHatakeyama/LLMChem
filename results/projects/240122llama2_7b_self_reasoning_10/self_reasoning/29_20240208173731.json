    "Reason": "2-Methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The aldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
