    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius for each fluorine atom. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The biphenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
