    "Reason": "1,1-Dimethylacetamide has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is acetamide, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in n,n'-dimethylacetamide will affect its melting point: (1) Two methyl groups can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
