    "Reason": "2-Methyl-cyclopentanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentane, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
