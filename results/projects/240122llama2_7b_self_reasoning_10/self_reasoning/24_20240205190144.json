    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is the phenyl group, which introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, raising the melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The methyl sulfone group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, raising the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces additional molecular weight and rigidity, raising the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C.",
