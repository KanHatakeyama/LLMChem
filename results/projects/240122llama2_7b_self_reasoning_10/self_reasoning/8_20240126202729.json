    "Reason": "1-Propyl substitution generally lowers the melting point compared to the base of ethanol due to reducing the crystal lattice stability. The additional methyl group introduces more molecular weight and rigidity, which can contribute to an increased melting point. However, the propyl group introduces more hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
