    "Reason": "1,3-dinitrobenzene has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two nitro groups (\u2013NO2) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each nitro group can raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the presence of a dioxane-like bridging moiety can add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius for this structural feature.",
