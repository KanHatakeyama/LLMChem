    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The acetate group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
