    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. 2. The compound has two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. 3. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, raising the melting point by approximately +5 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. 4. The 2-methylphenyl group introduces a more rigid structure, contributing approximately +5 due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. 5. The 2-oxoethyl group introduces a more rigid structure, contributing approximately +5 due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. 6. The N-phenylbenzamide group introduces a more rigid structure, contributing approximately +5 due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
