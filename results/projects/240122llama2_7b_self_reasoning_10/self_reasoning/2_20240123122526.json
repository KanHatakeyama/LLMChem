    "Reason": "6-methylpyridine-2-carboxaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the basic unit of pyridine, which has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C. The methyl group adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The carboxaldehyde group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
