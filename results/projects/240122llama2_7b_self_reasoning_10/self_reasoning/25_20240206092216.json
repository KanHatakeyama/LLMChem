    "Reason": "1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy-, tri has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be 2-hydroxy-propane, which has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The presence of three carboxylic acid groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the rigidity of the structure. Each carboxylic acid group can be estimated to add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of a rigid structure. Additionally, the hydroxyl group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point. The carbonyl group also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10. The presence of three methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the carboxylic acid group, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius each.",
