    "Reason": "1,1-Dimethylhydantoin is a basic unit for this compound, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The dromostanolone structure also contains aromatic rings, which can contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. Lastly, the ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), one methyl group (+5\u00b0C), one methoxy group (+5\u00b0C), and one ketone group (+30\u00b0C).",
