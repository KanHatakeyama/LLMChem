    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrafluorobenzene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 4 fluorines) = 60 degrees Celsius.",
