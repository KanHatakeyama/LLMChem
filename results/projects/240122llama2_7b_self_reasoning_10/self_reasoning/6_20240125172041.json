    "Reason": "2,2-dimethyl propanoic acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for our comparison will be propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 \u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The methyl groups in 2,2-dimethyl propanoic acid increase the melting point due to their effect on the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each methyl group can be estimated to add approximately +10 \u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the carboxylic acid group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
