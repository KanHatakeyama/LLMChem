    "Reason": "1E-N-hydroxy-1-(4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl)propan-1-imine has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 1-propanol, which has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1E-N-hydroxy-1-(4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl)propan-1-imine will affect its melting point: (1) The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. (2) The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. (3) The bicyclic system (4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. (4) The imine group introduces a dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
