    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro functional group (\u2013NO2) increases the melting point due to the presence of a strong dipole moment, which enhances intermolecular interactions and raises the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydroxyl group. The toluene ring (C6H5) adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of aromaticity. The nitro group (\u2013NO2) raises the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C due to the presence of a strong dipole moment.",
