    "Reason": "2,5-Bis(1-naphthyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 \u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969), we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a fused structure. Each additional phenyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +100 \u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and pi-stacking interactions. Additionally, the oxadiazole ring itself can contribute around +20 \u00b0C due to increased molecular rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding.",
