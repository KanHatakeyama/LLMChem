    "Reason": "1-Pyrrolidinyl is a functional group that can significantly impact the melting point. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The pyrrolidinyl group introduces a rigid structure with a melting point increase of approximately +20\u00b0C due to the additional molecular weight and the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The pyridine ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The pyridine ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +20\u00b0C.",
