    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong dipole moment, increasing intermolecular interactions and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the phenyl group contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance the crystalline structure and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The acetonitrile group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
