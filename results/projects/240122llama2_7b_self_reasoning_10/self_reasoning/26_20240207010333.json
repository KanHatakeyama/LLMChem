    "Reason": "1,1'-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly enhances the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably affect the melting point.",
