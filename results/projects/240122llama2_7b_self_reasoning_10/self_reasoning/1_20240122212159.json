    "Reason": "3-pentanol, 3-methyl- has a melting point of -10.5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (N=C=O) adds a significant increase in melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and rigidity. The methyl group also adds some rigidity and weight, which can contribute to the melting point. The exact impact of the carbamate group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate a significant increase due to the hydrogen bonding and rigidity.",
