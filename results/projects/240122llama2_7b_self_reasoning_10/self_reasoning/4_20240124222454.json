    "Reason": "2-Methylaziridine has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and increases the molecular weight, which can contribute to a higher melting point. The aziridine ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding. The methyl group can be estimated to add approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The aziridine ring can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding.",
