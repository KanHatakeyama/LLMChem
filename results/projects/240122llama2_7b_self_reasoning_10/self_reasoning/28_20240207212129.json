    "Reason": "1-(3-methoxybenzoyl)-2-(1-naphthoyl)hydrazine has a melting point that we can compare to naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The methoxybenzoyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The naphthoyl group introduces two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
