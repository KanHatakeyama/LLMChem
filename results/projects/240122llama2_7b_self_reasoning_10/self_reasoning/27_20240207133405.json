    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, sulfisoxazole has a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The sulfur atom can also form a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point. The exact impact of the sulfur atom is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the sulfur atom as a rough estimate. The sulfur atom can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the formation of a rigid structure and the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding.",
