    "Reason": "2,4-dibromobenzene has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C for each bromine atom. The bromine atoms also increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C per bromine atom.",
