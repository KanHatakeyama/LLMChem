    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base melting point is around -106\u00b0C. The presence of six methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size which raises the melting point. However, the isocyanate group introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5\u00b0C each.",
