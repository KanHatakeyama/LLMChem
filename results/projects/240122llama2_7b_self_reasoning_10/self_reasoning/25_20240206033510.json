    "Reason": "2-Methyl-cyclopentanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit, cyclopentanone, has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a bulky side chain, which can increase the melting point due to steric hindrance and molecular volume, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
