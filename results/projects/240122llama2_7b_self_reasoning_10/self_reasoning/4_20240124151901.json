    "Reason": "1,1'-Phenylene is a basic unit for our comparison, with a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group and an amino group. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The amino group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may contribute around +10\u00b0C.",
