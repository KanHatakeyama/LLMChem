    "Reason": "1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C due to the presence of two epoxide groups, which increase the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, leading to a higher melting point. The epoxide groups also introduce dipole-dipole interactions, which can further contribute to the melting point.",
