    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for this compound can be considered anthracene, which has a melting point of 106.5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. Additionally, the nitro group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may further contribute to the melting point. The exact impact of the nitro group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
