    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the methyl groups can contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C each. The carbonyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
