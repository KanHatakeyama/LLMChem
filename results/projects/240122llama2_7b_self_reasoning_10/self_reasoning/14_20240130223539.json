    "Reason": "1-(2-nitro),2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is 1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The two phenyl groups in the dibenzoylmethane structure add approximately +20 each due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky side chain, adding approximately +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The hydrazono-nitrogen unit introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +20. The dibenzoyl group introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would add approximately +20 each due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
