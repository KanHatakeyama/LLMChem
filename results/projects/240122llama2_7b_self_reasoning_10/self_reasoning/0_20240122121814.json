    "Reason": "Propanoic acid has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C. The diethyl ester functional group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The ester group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point. The presence of two ester groups can increase the hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point.",
