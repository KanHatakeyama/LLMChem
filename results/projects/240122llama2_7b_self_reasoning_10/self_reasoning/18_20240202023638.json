    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Fluorine substituents also contribute to the melting point due to their increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +5\u00b0C each.",
