    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is the chloromethyl group, which introduces a significant increase due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 2 chlorines) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
