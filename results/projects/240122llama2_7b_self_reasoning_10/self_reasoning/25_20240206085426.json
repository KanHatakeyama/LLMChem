    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of anthracene, which is around 100\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The anthracene base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C.",
