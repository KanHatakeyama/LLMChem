    "Reason": "Benzoyl peroxide is a compound with a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a t-butyl group can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a rigid, planar structure. The t-butyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. The peroxide group (-O-O-) can also increase the melting point due to the presence of two oxygen atoms, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the molecular weight.",
