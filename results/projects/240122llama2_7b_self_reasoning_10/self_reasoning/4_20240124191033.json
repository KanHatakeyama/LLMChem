    "Reason": "1,1'-Terphenyl has a melting point of 178.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a nitro group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The nitro group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the molecular weight. In the case of (2Z)-2-cyano-3-(4-nitrophenyl)prop-2-enethioamide, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion and a nitro group. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The nitro group can also contribute approximately +20\u00b0C due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding.",
