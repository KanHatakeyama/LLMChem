    "Reason": "4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The butanone functional group introduces a ketone group, which can participate in dipole interactions, increasing the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups can contribute to a total increase of approximately +50\u00b0C.",
