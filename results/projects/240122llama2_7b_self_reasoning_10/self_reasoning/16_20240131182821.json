    "Reason": "2-[(E)-2-(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)vinyl]-6-methoxy-4-methylphenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of a hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The vinyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group also introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
