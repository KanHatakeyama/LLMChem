    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be the acetanilide moiety, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The introduction of a fluorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings. The chlorine atom also raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
