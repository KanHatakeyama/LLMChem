    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom increases the molecular weight and introduces strong withdrawing groups, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the difluoro group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
