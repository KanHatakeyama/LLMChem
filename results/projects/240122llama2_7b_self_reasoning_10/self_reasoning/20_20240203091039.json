    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of two fluorine substituents increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 2 fluorines) = 30 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The alcohol group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
