    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The tebuconazole structure also includes a methoxy group, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional rigid structures and molecular weight.",
