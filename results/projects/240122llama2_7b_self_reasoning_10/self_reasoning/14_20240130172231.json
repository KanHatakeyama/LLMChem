    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two methoxy groups, a benzyl group, and an acetyl group. The methoxy groups increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The acetyl group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C.",
