    "Reason": "1-chlorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the adjacent ethyl group, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
