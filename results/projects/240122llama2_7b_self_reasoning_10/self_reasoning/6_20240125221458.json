    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is anthracene, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. (2) The nitro group (\u2013NO2) raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. (3) The additional functional groups and structural features in 9-nitroanthracene will affect its melting point: (a) Two additional phenyl rings can add approximately +30 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (b) The nitro group introduces a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. (c) The additional pi-pi interactions within the two additional phenyl rings can contribute around +20 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
