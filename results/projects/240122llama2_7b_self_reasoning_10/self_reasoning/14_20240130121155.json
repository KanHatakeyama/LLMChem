    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be pyridine, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The presence of five chlorine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds, which raises it by approximately +20\u00b0C each.",
