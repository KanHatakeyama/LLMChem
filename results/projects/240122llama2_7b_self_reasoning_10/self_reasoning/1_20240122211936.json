    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit of analysis is the imidazole ring, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius due to its planarity and rigidity. The phenyl group can increase the melting point by around +30 degrees Celsius due to its ability to enhance van der Waals interactions and rigidity. The presence of two phenyl groups can contribute to an increase of around +60 degrees Celsius.",
