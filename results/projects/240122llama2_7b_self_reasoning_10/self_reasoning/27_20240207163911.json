    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-imidazolidine has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, 1,3,5-trimethyl-2-imidazolidine, has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each methyl group is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the phosphate group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius.",
