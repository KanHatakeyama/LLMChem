    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The iodine atom introduces a significant increase due to the formation of iodine-based compounds, which have a higher melting point than hydrogen-bonded compounds. The additional functional groups and structural features in 5-iodoindole will affect its melting point: (1) The iodine atom itself adds approximately +50 due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of iodine-based compounds; (2) The indole ring itself adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds; (3) The methyl group introduces a small increase due to the increase in molecular weight; (4) The carbonyl group introduces a small increase due to the formation of hydrogen bonds.",
