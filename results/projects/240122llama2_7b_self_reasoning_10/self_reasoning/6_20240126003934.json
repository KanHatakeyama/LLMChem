    "Reason": "1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-Octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,4-diiodobutane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 8 fluorines) = 120 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the iodine atom also increases the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
