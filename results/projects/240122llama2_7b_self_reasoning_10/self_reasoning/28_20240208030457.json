    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanamine has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base of ethanedione (with a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius). The basic unit for our comparison will be ethanedione, which has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 1,2-diphenylethanamine, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
