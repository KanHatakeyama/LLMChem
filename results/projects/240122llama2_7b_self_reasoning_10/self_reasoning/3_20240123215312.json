    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound can be considered butane (with a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C) because the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and the isobutyryl group enhances the molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The acetate group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase the molecular weight.",
