    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
