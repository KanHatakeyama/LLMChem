    "Reason": "1,2-diphenyl ethane has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group may contribute approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the nitrogen atom introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The oxygen atom also introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which may raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
