    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl group: The 3-chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, with an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C for each fluorine atom.",
