    "Reason": "1-methyl-2-pyridine base, with a melting point around -10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
