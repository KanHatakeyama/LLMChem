    "Reason": "2,2-Dimethyl-3-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The cyclopropane ring introduces a rigid structure, increasing molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The methyl groups contribute to a slight increase in molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +5\u00b0C each. The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
