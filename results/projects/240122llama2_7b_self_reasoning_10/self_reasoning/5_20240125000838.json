    "Reason": "2-(dimethylamino)ethyl is a functional group that can significantly impact the melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two dimethylamino groups (\u2013N(CH3)2) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the amino group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
