    "Reason": "17-Ol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of three phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The androstane ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for three phenyl groups, we have +60\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +50\u00b0C, the carbonyl function at +30\u00b0C (lesser than a typical ketone due to conjugation and steric hindrance by the adjacent large groups), and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +40\u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system). This totals to an adjusted predicted increase of +180\u00b0C.",
