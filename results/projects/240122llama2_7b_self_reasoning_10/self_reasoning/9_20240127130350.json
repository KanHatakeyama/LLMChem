    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The furanyl group (C2(C)C) and the isopropyl group (C(C)C) add rigidity and molecular weight, increasing the melting point by approximately +20 and +10, respectively. The carbonyl group (C=O) introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, which raises the melting point by approximately +30. The nitro group (C2=O) adds a strong dipole moment, increasing intermolecular interactions and melting point by approximately +50. The methyl group (C(C)C) adds a bulky side chain, reducing the melting point by approximately -10 due to steric hindrance. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
