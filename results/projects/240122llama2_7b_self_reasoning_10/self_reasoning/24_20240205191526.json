    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. Additionally, the piperazine ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group also reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius.
