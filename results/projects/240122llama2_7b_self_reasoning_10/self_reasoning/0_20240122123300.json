    "Reason": "4-chlorophenyl is a bulky group that can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and steric hindrance. The hydroxyl group can also contribute to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. The chlorine atom can also participate in dipole-dipole interactions, which can increase the melting point.",
