    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is methyl, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The ethyl group has a melting point of -118.2\u00b0C, and the sulfur atom has a melting point of -115.2\u00b0C. The presence of the sulfur atom creates a polar functional group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group. However, the ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a nonpolar functional group. The methyl group does not affect the melting point significantly.",
