    "Reason": "1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is hexane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in butyl heptanoate will affect its melting point: (1) The butyl group (C(CCCCCC)OCCCC) adds approximately +20 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The heptanoate group (O=C(CCCCCC)OCCCC) adds roughly +10 due to the presence of a carboxylate group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
