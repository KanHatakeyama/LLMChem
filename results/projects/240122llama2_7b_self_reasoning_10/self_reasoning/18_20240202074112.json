    "Reason": "5-chloro-2,3-diaminopyridine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is 2,3-diminopyridine, which has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The two nitrogen atoms form a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C.",
