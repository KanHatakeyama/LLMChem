    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene has a melting point of -10.0\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group in the structure of benzenamine, n,n,2,6-tetramethyl- increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the rigidity introduced by the methyl groups. The tetramethyl group also adds to the molecular weight and size, further increasing the melting point. The net effect is a significant increase in melting point due to the combination of functional groups and molecular size.",
