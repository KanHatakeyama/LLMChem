    "Reason": "2-Amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine has a melting point that we can compare to 3-fluoropyridine, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2-amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine will affect its melting point: (1) The fluorine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +10. (2) The chlorine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5. (3) The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5.",
