    "Reason": "2-ethylhexylacetate has a melting point that can be predicted by comparing it to ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two ethyl groups (\u2013CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of these groups also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a raised melting point due to the increase in molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding.",
