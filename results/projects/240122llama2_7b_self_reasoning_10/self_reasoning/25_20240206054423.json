    "Reason": "4-Morpholinylmethyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a morpholine ring, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group can also participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzene ring can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
