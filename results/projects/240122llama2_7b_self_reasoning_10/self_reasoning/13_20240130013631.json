    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl is a bulky group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the rigid structure and molecular weight. Each morpholinyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The nitro group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each.",
