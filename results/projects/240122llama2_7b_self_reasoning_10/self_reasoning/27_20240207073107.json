    "Reason": "1,3,4-Thiadiazole ring: The presence of a 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The ethoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The trifluoromethyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
