    "Reason": "1-methylcyclohexane is a simple alkane molecule with a straight chain and no functional groups. The melting point of a simple alkane can be estimated based on the molecular weight and the intermolecular forces between the molecules. The van der Waals forces between the molecules increase as the molecular weight increases, which results in a higher melting point. The methyl group adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and size.",
