    "Reason": "2-bromo-2'-methoxyacetophenone has a melting point that we will compare to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The presence of a methoxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
