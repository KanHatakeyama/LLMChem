    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional rigid structure and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The acetonitrile group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
