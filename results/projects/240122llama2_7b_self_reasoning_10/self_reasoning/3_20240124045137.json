    "Reason": "3,3,3-trifluoro-N-(1-methylpropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 \u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The trifluoromethyl group (\u2013CF3) adds approximately +10 \u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The methyl group (\u2013CH2CH3) introduces a small increase of approximately +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding. The fluorine atoms (\u2013F) contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at approximately +10 \u00b0C each. The nitrogen atom (\u2013N) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The carbamate group (\u2013CO\u2013NH\u2013) introduces a significant increase due to the formation of hydrogen bonds, estimated at approximately +20 \u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group (\u2013CF3) also raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at approximately +10 \u00b0C.",
