    "Reason": "Anthrone has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in anthrone will affect its melting point: (1) The two phenyl groups should significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. (2) The anthraquinone ring (Cc3ccccc3C2=O) has a melting point of around +20\u00b0C due to its rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. (3) The methyl group (C1=O) can add approximately +5\u00b0C due to its small size and limited impact on the molecular structure.",
