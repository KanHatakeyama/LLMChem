    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The cyclohexene group itself contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid and anhydride functionalities introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
