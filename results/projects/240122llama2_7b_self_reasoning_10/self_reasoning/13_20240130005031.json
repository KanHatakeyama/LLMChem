    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, methane, has a melting point of -161.0 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the dioxole ring, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The dioxole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
