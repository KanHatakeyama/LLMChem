    "Reason": "1,2-diphenyl-3-buten-1-ol, also known as embelin, has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the buten-1-ol moiety introduces a rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential, which may raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a strong dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C.",
