    "Reason": "2,5-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which melts at 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is phenol, which has a melting point around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two nitro groups (\u2013NO2) increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The dinitro group introduces two additional nitro functionalities, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The ether linkage reduces the melting point by approximately -2\u00b0C due to decreased hydrogen bonding potential.",
