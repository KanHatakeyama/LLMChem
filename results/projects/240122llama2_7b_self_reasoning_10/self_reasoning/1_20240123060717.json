    "Reason": "2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)phenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a pyrrolidinyl group, which can increase the melting point due to its rigidity and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The pyrrolidinyl group can contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C to the melting point.",
