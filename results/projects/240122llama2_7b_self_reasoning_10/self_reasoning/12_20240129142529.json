    "Reason": "1,3-dianhydride compounds have a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The nitrogen within the anhydride moiety also participates in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. Lastly, the presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
