    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene, also known as Dec-1-yne, has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethene, which has a melting point of -169.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the chlorine atom can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
