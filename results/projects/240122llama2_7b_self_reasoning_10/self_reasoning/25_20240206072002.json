    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of anhydrous phenol, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is phenol, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two nitro groups increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each nitro group might raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The dinitro group also introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the nitro group, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius for each methoxy group.",
