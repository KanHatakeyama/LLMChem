    "Reason": "2-Amino-pyridine base (pyridine itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C) with a methyl group attached, which reduces the melting point due to the reduced crystal lattice stability, estimated at around -10\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced crystal lattice stability, estimated at around -10\u00b0C.",
