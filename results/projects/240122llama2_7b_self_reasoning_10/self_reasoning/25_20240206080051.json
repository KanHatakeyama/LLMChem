    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may add roughly +20 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The additional functionalities and structural features in p-methyl benzyl alcohol will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
