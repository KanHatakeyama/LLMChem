    "Reason": "1,1'-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The presence of three phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +60\u00b0C per group, totaling +180\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The presence of three phenyl groups, two methoxy groups, and one thiadiazole ring contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.
