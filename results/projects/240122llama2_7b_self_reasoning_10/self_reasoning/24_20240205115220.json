    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one phenyl group, we have +20\u00b0C total (less influence due to the complex structure), one chlorine atom at +50\u00b0C, and one fluorine atom at +10\u00b0C.",
