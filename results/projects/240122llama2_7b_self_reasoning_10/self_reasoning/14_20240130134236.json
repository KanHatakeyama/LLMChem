    "Reason": "1H-Carbazole has a melting point that is influenced by its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The carbazole ring introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the tetrahydro-functionality introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C.",
