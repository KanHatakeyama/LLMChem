    "Reason": "1-methylcyclohexane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom reduces the molecular weight and size, which generally lowers the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point. The net effect should be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
