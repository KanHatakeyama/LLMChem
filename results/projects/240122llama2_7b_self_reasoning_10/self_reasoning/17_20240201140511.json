    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by about +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the piperazine ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The thiol group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The lactone ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10\u00b0C.",
