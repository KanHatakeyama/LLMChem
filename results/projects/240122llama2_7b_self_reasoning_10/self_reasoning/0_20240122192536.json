    "Reason": "1-bromohexadecane has a melting point of 40\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the melting point of hexane (which is 10\u00b0C). This is due to the presence of the bromine atom, which increases the molecular weight and enhances the intermolecular interactions, leading to a higher melting point.",
