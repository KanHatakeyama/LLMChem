    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is n-butanol, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of three additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the phosphate group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
