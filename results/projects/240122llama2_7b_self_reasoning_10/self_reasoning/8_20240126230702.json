    "Reason": "1-hexanol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an acetate group (\u2013COO\u2013) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each hexyl group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius.",
