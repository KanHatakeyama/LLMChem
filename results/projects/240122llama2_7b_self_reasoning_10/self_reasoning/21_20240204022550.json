    "Reason": "2,5-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The dinitro group introduces two significant withdrawing groups, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C each. The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C per group, totaling +20\u00b0C.",
