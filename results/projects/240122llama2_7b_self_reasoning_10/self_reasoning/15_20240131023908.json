    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups in (3beta,4alpha,8alpha,17xi,20xi)-4,14-dimethyl-8,9-epoxycholestan-3-ol increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +100\u00b0C to the melting point due to the rigidity and pi-stacking interactions of the additional phenyl rings.",
