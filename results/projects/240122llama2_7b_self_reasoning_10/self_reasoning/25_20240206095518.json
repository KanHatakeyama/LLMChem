    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanol has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base of ethanol. The basic unit for comparison is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the biguanide group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10.",
