    "Reason": "5-chloro-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a chlorine atom, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The nitro group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for this functional group.",
