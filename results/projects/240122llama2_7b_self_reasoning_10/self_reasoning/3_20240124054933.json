    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and electronegativity, which raises the melting point. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (20 degrees Celsius x 2 chlorines) = 40 degrees Celsius.",
