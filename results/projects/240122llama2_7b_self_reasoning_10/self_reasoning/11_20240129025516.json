    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two chloromethyl groups (\u2013CH2Cl) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the chlorine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The chloromethyl group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C. The net effect is a significant increase due to both molecular size and rigid structure.",
