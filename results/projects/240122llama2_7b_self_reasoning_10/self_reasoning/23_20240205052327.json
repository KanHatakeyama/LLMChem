    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at -5\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at -5\u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The ether linkage reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at -5\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
