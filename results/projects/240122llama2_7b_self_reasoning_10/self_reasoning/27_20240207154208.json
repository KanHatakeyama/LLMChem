    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The stilbene ring formation introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C for this structural feature. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +2\u00b0C for this structural feature.",
