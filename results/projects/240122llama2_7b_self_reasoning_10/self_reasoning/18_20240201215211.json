    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group can lower the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume. The methyl group can contribute around -10 to -5\u00b0C.",
