    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The octyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius per group, totaling +40 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methyl groups reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular weight.",
