    "Reason": "1,6-hexanediol, the basic unit, has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The hexyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, estimated at approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
