    "Reason": "4'-(methylthio)acetophenone has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The methylthio group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The acetophenone group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
