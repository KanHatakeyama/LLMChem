    "Reason": "4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethylbenzene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The introduction of two methyl groups and one ethyl group increases the molecular weight and volume, which raises the melting point. The ethyl group introduces a more rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point. The methyl groups increase the molecular weight and volume, which raises the melting point. The presence of two methyl groups and one ethyl group raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The ethyl group introduces a more rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point. The effects are additive.",
