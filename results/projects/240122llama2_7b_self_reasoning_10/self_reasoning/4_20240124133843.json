    "Reason": "4-decylphenyl and methylbenzamide functional groups are present in the compound under consideration. The decylphenyl group, which is a bulky and rigid structure, can increase the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The methylbenzamide group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The methyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding. The decyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to increase molecular weight and rigidity.",
