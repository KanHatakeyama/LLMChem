    "Reason": "1,3-propanedisulfide has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be the propane moiety, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The propyl group introduces a bulky structure, which also raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The sulfur atom introduces a strong dipole moment, which raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding. The sulfur atom also introduces a rigid structure, which raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.
