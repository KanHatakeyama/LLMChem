    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is phenol, which has a melting point of -95.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two nitro groups significantly increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each nitro group may contribute around +50 to +70\u00b0C. Additionally, the amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The dinitro group also introduces two additional phenyl rings, which can contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each additional phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
