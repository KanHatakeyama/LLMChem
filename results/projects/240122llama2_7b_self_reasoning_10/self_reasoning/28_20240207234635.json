    "Reason": "1-Aspartic acid base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that asparagine itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of an ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) has a slight lowering effect because it does not participate in hydrogen bonding as intensely as a hydroxyl group would.",
