    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius each. The naphthalene ring formation introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the perinaphthenone structure possesses a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
