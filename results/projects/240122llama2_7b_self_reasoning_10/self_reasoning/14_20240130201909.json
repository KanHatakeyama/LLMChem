    "Reason": "3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group (\u2013F\u2013F\u2013F) adds rigidity and molecular weight, increasing the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The phenyl group (C1=CC=CC=C1) introduces pi-pi interactions and rigidity, contributing approximately +30\u00b0C. The carboxy group (C(=O)O) adds a hydroxyl group, which raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group (C(F)(F)F) adds a bulky side chain, reducing the melting point due to steric hindrance, approximately -10\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity, approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
