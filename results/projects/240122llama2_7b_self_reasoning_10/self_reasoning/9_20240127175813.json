    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The sulfone group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, contributing approximately +30\u00b0C. The bromine atom also introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
