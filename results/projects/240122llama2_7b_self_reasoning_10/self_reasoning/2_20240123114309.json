    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole is a basic unit with a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. Incasan has three phenyl groups, which significantly increase the melting point due to strong pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius, for a total increase of +60 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the thiadiazole ring introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius. The nitro group can also contribute to the melting point due to its strong dipole moment, estimated at approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The ketone group can also participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its small size and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
