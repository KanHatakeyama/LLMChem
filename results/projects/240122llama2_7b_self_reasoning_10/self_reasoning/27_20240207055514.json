    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to steric hindrance and reducing the crystal lattice stability, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential for dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The presence of three phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +60\u00b0C.",
