    "Reason": "1-methylcyclohexane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, cyclohexane, has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to cyclohexane, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C.",
