    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. Additionally, the thiol group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each.",
