    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for rhodanine can be considered 1,3,4-thiadiazole, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in rhodanine will affect its melting point: (1) The nitro group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. (2) The sulfur atom in the thiadiazole ring can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. (3) The methyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to its effect on the molecular volume.",
