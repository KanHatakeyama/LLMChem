    "Reason": "2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)phenol has a basic unit of phenol, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The pyrrolidinyl group can increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the molecular weight. The estimated increase in melting point due to the pyrrolidinyl group is around +10\u00b0C.",
