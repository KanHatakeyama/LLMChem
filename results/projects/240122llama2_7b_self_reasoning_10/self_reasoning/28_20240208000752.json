    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the benzyl group (C(=C)C) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
