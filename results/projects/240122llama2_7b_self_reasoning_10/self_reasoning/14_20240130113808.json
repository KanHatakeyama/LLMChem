    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The compound has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the two amino groups (N) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
