    "Reason": "1-dodecanol has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a saturated hydrocarbon chain with a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius. The dodecanol structure also has a methyl group, which can increase the melting point by around +5 degrees Celsius due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
