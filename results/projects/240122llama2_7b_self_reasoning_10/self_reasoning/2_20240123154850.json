    "Reason": "2-methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The methoxy group can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The aldehyde group can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +20\u00b0C due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and form a rigid structure.",
