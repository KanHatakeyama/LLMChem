    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The cyclohexene group itself contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The anhydride functional group introduces a carbonyl group, which raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The cyclohexene ring also contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion also raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
