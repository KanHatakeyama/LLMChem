    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of prochlorperazine, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the presence of a chlorine atom can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
