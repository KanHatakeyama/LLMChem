    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl group: The 3-nitro group can increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +10\u00b0C.\nPhenyl group (5E): The 5-phenyl group can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising it by approximately +20\u00b0C.\nPhenylhydrazono group: The hydrazono group can increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +5\u00b0C.\nThiadiazol-2-yl group: The thiadiazole ring can increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +5\u00b0C.\nMethylene bridge: The methylene bridge can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising it by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
