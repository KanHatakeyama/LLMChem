    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The alcohol group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
