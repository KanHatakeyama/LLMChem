    "Reason": "6-methylpyridine-2-carboxaldehyde has a basic structure similar to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The methyl group adds approximately 10\u00b0C to the melting point, and the carboxyl group may contribute around +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding.",
