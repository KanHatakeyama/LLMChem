    "Reason": "1,1,1,3,3,3-hexadeutero-2-propanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-propanone, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The presence of six deuterium atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius per deuterium. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by +5 degrees Celsius. The deuterium atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius per deuterium.",
