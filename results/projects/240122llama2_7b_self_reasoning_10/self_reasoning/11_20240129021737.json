    "Reason": "4,5-Dihydro-3,5-diphenylisoxazole has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The compound has two phenyl groups, which significantly increase the melting point due to molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group may contribute around +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the isoxazole ring introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
