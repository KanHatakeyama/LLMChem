    "Reason": "16-methyl-17-oxoandrost-5-en-3-yl acetate has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is androstane (with a melting point of 106\u00b0C). The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The oxo group (\u2013O\u2013) can also contribute to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The acetate group (\u2013CO\u2013) can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The ketone group (\u2013CO\u2013) can also contribute to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.
