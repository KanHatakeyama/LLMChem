    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong dipole moment and increased molecular weight. The nitro group can raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the acetonitrile group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
