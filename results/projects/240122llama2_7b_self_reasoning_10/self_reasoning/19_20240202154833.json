    "Reason": "9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The fluorenyl group itself contributes to the melting point due to its high molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The succinimide group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
