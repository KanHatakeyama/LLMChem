    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The sulfur atom within the methylsulfanyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The diphenyl ether introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
