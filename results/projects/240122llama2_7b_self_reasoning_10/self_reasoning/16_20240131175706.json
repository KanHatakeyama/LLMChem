    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is 2-methylanisole, which has a melting point around 50 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C.",
