    "Reason": "2-chloroethylamine has a melting point of -10.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two chlorine atoms increases the melting point due to the electronegativity and dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 2 chlorines) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
