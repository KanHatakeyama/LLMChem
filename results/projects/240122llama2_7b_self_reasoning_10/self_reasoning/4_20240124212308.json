    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-tridecafluoroheptane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be hexane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the fluorine substituents significantly increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 7 fluorines) = 105 degrees Celsius.",
