    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline, the base unit, has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the acetyl group (\u2013COCH3) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The benzyl group (\u2013C(=C)C) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) adds approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The methoxy groups (\u2013O\u2013) add approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The dimethoxy group (\u2013O\u2013O\u2013) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The furan ring (\u2013O\u2013) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) adds approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight.",
