    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with two additional phenyl groups, which would significantly increase the melting point due to pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the naphthalene ring formation introduces two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 30 to 50\u00b0C due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
