    "Reason": "3-methyl-butyraldehyde oxime has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its functional groups. The basic unit is butyraldehyde, which has a melting point of around 50\u00b0C. The methyl group adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The oxime group can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point by around +20\u00b0C. The presence of a carbonyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to van der Waals forces and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. Finally, the oxime group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point by around +10\u00b0C.",
