    "Reason": "1,3-di-p-tolyl-2-thiourea has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, a methoxy group, and a thiourea group. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The thiourea group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
