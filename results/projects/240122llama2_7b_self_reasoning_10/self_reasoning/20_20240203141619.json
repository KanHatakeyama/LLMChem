    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point of 30 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The methyl groups also increase the crystal lattice stability, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
