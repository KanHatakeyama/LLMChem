    "Reason": "3,3,3-trifluoro-N-(1-methylpropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1-methyl-1-propanol, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The trifluoromethyl group (F) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The fluorine substituents (F) also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. The methyl group (C(C)C) adds approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The propanamide group (C(=O)NC(C)CC) adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The trifluoromethyl group (F) raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The fluorine substituents (F) also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure.",
