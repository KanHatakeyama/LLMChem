    "Reason": "1,1'-Dimethylacetamide has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is acetamide, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups (\u2013CH3) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the methyl groups also increase the crystal lattice stability, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
