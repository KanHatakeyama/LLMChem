    "Reason": "1,1'-phenyl-2-propanol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group linked to a propanol functional group. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C. The propanol group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of a phenyl group linked to a propanol functional group increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight.",
