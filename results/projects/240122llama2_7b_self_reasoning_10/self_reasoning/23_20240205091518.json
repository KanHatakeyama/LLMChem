    "Reason": "4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethylbenzene, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the methyl groups introduce a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5 to +10\u00b0C each. The ethyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
