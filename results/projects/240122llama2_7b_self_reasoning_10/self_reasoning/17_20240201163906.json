    "Reason": "3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The introduction of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The carboxy group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.
