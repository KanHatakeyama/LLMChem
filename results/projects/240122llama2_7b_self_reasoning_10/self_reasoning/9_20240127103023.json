    "Reason": "4-{(2E)-3-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]prop-2-enoyl}phenyl has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The dimethylamino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The prop-2-enoyl group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.
