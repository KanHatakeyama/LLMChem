    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of anthracene, which is around 100\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in 9-nitroanthracene will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
