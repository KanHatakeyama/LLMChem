    "Reason": "5-tert-butyl-2-methyl-3-furoic acid has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group, a furan ring, and a tert-butyl group. The methyl group adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The furan ring itself contributes around +30\u00b0C due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. The tert-butyl group can add approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
