    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenyl can increase the melting point due to the additional pi-system and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
