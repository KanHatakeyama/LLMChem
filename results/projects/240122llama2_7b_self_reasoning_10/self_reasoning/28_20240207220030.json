    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is furfuryl, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The isopropyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which raises the melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The isopropyl group also introduces a methyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact.",
