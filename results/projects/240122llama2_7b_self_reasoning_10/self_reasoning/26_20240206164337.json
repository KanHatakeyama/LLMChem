    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each additional pi-system component. The acetate group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at around -5 \u00b0C. The ester group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
