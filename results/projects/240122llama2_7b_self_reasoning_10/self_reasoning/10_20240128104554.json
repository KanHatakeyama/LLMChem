    "Reason": "2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl alcohol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of three methyl groups (\u2013CH3) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The benzene ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups also increase the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The trimethyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
