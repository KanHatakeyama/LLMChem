    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point by approximately -2 degrees Celsius due to decreased hydrogen bonding potential. The methoxy group may also increase the melting point by approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The carbamate group raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential.",
