    "Reason": "1-phenyl-hydrazinecarboxamide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is hydrazine, which has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitrogen atom and a hydrogen atom. The phenyl group adds rigidity and molecular weight, increasing the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carboxamide group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of a nitrogen atom also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
