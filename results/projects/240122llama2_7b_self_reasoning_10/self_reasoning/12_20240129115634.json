    "Reason": "2,4-dibromobenzene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +20\u00b0C each. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The bromine atoms also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +20\u00b0C each.",
