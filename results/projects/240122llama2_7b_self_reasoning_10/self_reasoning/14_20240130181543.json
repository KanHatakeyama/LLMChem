    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. Naproanilide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for this compound can be considered piperazine, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the naphthalene ring formation introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
