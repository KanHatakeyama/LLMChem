    "Reason": "1,2-bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The functional groups present in this molecule are: \n- Amino groups: These groups can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, which can increase the melting point. Each amino group can contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \n- Phenyl groups: The two phenyl rings can increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. \n- Ethyl group: The ethyl group can contribute to the molecular volume and rigidity, but its effect is relatively minor compared to the other functional groups.",
