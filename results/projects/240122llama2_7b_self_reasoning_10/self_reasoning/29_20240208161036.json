    "Reason": "1,3-Benzothiazole base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two phenyl groups, a chlorine atom, and a hydrazono-functionalities. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The hydrazono-functionalities and the thiadiazole ring introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for three phenyl groups, we have +60\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one chlorine atom at +5\u00b0C, and one hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +70\u00b0C.",
