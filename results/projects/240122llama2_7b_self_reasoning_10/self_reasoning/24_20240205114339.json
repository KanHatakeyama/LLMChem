    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20; The oxo group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5; The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +2; The prop-1-en-1-yl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5.",
