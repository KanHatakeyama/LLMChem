    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The introduction of a hexyl group (C6H13) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The hydroxyl group also participates in hydrogen bonding, which can further contribute to the melting point. The exact impact of the hexyl group depends on its exact structure and the degree of hydrogen bonding. A rough estimate for the hexyl group's effect might be around +20\u00b0C.",
