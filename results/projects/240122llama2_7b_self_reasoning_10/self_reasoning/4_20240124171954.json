    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point that we will compare to anthracene, which has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase intermolecular interactions and raise the melting point. Each nitro group can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. Additionally, the fused aromatic rings in anthracene contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 degrees Celsius for each additional fused ring.",
