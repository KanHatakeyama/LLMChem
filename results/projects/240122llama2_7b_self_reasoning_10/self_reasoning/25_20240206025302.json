    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The moramide group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
