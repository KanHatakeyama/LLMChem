    "Reason": "2,5-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenol groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The dinitro group introduces two strong withdrawing groups, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. The phenolic hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5\u00b0C for each methoxy group.",
