    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The sulfur atom within the methylsulfanyl group introduces a rigid structure, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The carboxyl group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point, approximately +5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
