    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The indole ring itself contributes to a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methoxy group can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
