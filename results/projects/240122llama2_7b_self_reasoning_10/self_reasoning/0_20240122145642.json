    "Reason": "4-n-propylbenzenesulfonyl chloride has a basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a sulfonyl group (\u2013SO2\u2013) can increase the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The n-propyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) adds another +10 \u00b0C due to its increased molecular weight and volume. Finally, the chlorine atom (\u2013Cl) can lower the melting point by approximately -5 \u00b0C due to its high electronegativity and the resulting dipole moment.",
