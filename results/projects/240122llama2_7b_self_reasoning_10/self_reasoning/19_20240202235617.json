    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chloromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The two chlorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the presence of polar functional groups, which can participate in dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
