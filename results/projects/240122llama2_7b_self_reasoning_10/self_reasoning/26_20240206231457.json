    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with two fused aromatic rings, which increases the melting point due to pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at +25 \u00b0C for this structural modification. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5 \u00b0C.",
