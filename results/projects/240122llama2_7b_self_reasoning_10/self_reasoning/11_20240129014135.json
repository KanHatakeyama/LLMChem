    "Reason": "2-bromo-3-iodo-5-methylpyridine has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group, a iodine atom, and a bromine atom. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group. The bromine atom also introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group. The effects are additive.",
