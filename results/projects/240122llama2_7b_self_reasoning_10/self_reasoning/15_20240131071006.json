    "Reason": "2-ethylhexylacetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups and a methyl group increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius.",
