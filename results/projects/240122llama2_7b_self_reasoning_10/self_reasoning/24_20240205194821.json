    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -97 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The nitrogen atom also introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to its small size and limited ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius.",
