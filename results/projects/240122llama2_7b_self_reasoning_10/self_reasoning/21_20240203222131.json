    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, based on the presence of two carbonyl groups, which typically increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The propan-1-imine base introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C.",
