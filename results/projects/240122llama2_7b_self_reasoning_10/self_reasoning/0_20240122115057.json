    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride has a melting point of 120\u00b0C. The anhydride functional group (-CO-O-CO-) is known to increase the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can form hydrogen bonds and dipole-dipole interactions. The cyclohexene ring also contributes to the melting point, as it is a rigid and planar structure that can enhance the crystalline structure. Additionally, the presence of two adjacent carboxylic acid groups can also increase the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the acid groups.",
