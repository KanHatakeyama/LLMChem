    "Reason": "4-methyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be 3-nitrobenzene, which has a melting point of -10.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group introduces a rigid structure and a hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The sulfur atom also introduces a rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
