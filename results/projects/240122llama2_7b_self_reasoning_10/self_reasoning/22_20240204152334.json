    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of three nitro groups increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of a rigid structure with hydrogen bonding potential. Each nitro group can raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the toluene ring introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point.",
