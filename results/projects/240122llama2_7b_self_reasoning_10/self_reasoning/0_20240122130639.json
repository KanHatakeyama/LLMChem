    "Reason": "1,2,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a complex molecular structure. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of five chlorine atoms, which increase the molecular weight and electronegativity, leading to a higher melting point. Additionally, the fused-ring structure of the PAH molecule creates a more rigid and planar molecular structure, which can also contribute to a higher melting point.",
