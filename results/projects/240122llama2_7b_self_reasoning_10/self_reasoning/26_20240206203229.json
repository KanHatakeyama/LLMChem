    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The basic unit for this compound is 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
