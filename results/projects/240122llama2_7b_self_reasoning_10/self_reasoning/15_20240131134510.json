    "Reason": "1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of butane, which is around -10\u00b0C. The introduction of two epoxide groups increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group. The epoxide ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C.",
