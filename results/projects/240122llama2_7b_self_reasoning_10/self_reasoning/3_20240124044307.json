    "Reason": "4-cyanophenyl can increase the melting point due to the additional rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, lowering the melting point by approximately -10 \u00b0C. The acetate group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C.",
