    "Reason": "1,5-dioxane has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. Each additional carbon atom in the chain increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The exact impact of this structural modification can be estimated as follows: (1) The basic unit, n-heptane, has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. (2) Each additional carbon atom in the chain increases the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
