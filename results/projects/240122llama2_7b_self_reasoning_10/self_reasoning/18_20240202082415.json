    "Reason": "1,3-diaminopropane has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two nitrogen atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The diamide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
