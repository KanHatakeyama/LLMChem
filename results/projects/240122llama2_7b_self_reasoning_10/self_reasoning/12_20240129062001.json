    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be the imidazole ring, which has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to its rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
