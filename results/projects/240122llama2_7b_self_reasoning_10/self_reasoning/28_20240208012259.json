    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-chloroaniline has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a polar group, participating in hydrogen bonding and rigidifying the structure, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C.",
