    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. Zileuton has a melting point that is significantly higher due to the presence of a methoxyphenoxy group, which increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methoxy group also introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, further contributing to the melting point. The carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which might raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value.",
