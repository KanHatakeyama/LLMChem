    "Reason": "2-Vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the vinyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20\u00b0C.",
