    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for our comparison is 2-nitropyridine, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
