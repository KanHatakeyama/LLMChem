    "Reason": "3-methyl-butyraldehyde oxime has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is butyraldehyde, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The oxime group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
