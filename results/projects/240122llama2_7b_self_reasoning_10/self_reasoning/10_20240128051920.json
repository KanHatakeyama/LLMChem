    "Reason": "1-chloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 1 chlorine) = 10 degrees Celsius.",
