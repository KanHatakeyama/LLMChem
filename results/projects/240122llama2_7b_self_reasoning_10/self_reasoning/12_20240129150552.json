    "Reason": "1,1'-Bis(phenylmethyl)propane, also known as Bucetalon, has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
