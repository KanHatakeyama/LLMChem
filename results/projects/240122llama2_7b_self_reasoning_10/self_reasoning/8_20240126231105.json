    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups (5-butyl and 5-ethyl) increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The butyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
