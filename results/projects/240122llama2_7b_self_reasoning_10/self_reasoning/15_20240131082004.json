    "Reason": "1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of four chlorine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity which raises the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
