    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole is a rigid structure with a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group can increase the melting point due to the dipole moment and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the molecular weight. The hydrazono group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding. The ketone group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions.",
