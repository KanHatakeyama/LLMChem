    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, chlorimipramine has a methoxy group, which can increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at about +5 to +10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
