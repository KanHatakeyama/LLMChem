    "Reason": "1-Propyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to a benzene base. The additional methyl group introduces more molecular weight and rigidity, but the propyl group also introduces more hydrogen bonding potential. The net effect should be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
