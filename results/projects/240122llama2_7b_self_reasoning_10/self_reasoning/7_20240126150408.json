    "Reason": "1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-Octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane has a melting point that we can compare to 1,4-diiodobutane, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 8 fluorines) = 120 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the iodine atom also increases the melting point due to its electronegativity and the formation of iodine-fluorine interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
