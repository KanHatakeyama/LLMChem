    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one has a melting point of 120.0 degrees Celsius. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The indole ring itself has a melting point of -105.0 degrees Celsius, and the phenyl group adds approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The total increase due to the nitro group and phenyl group is approximately +70\u00b0C.",
