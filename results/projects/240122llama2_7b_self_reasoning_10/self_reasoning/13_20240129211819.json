    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The methoxy groups (two in total) increase the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each methoxy group may raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group also contributes to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C.",
