    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol is a compound with a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C. The presence of a phenylmethyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) will increase the melting point due to the additional rigidity and molecular weight. The phenyl group itself can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) will lower the melting point due to its small size and lack of hydrogen bonding potential, which can reduce it by approximately -5\u00b0C.",
