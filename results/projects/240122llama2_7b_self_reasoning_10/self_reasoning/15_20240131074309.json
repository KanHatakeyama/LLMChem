    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-chloroaniline has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its functional groups: The basic unit for this compound is 4-chlorobenzene, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom also contributes to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of the nitro group (N) can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
