    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C. The presence of a 2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional functional group and the resulting molecular weight increase. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group can also increase the melting point due to the additional functional group and the resulting molecular weight increase.",
