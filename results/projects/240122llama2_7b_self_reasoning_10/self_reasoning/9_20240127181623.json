    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The phenylmethyl group (Cc1ccccc1) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The benzene ring (Oc2ccc(O)cc2) introduces two additional phenyl groups, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
