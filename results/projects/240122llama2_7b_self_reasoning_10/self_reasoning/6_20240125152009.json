    "Reason": "1-propanol has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an isopropyl group (\u2013CH(CH3)2) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the additional methyl groups also increase the molecular weight and rigidity, which can further contribute to the melting point. The isopropyl group also introduces a new hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, further lowering the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity but not as low as the effect observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
