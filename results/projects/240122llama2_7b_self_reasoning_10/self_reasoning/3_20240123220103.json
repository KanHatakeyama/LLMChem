    "Reason": "4-biphenyl methyl ether has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, biphenyl, has a melting point of -172 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage can contribute to hydrogen bonding and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in p-acetylbiphenyl will affect its melting point: (1) The acetyl group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. (2) The phenyl group can enhance pi-pi interactions and overall molecular rigidity, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius. (3) The methoxy group can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
