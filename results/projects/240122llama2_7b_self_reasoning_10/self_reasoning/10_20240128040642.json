    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The ethyl group (C1(CCCC)CC) adds approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
