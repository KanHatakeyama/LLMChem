    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-imidazolidine has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of three methyl groups (\u2013CH3) in place of hydrogen atoms increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the imidazolidine ring formation introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point. The methyl groups also increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which can raise the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point due to the imidazolidine ring and rigid structure but a more significant increase due to the methyl groups.",
