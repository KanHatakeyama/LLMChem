    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two nitro groups introduces strong withdrawing groups, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigidity, hydrogen bonding potential, and molecular weight, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The dinitro group introduces two additional withdrawing groups, increasing the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. The phenol group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
