    "Reason": "1,3,4-Thiadiazole has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The methaqualone molecule has a melting point that is significantly higher than benzene due to the presence of a fused aromatic ring system, which increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. Each fused aromatic ring system can contribute around +25 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methaqualone molecule has a nitro functional group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The nitro group can contribute around +5 degrees Celsius. The methaqualone molecule also has a carbonyl group, which can form hydrogen bonds and increase the melting point. The carbonyl group can contribute around +10 degrees Celsius. Finally, the methaqualone molecule has a methyl group, which can lower the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and the lack of hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group can contribute around -5 degrees Celsius.",
