    "Reason": "4-Methoxybenzylidene group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +5. The oxazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at +20. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at +30. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at -5.",
