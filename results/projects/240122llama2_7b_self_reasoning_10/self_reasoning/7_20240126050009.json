    "Reason": "1,3-Butadiene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methylene bridge (\u2013C\u2013) in place of a hydrogen atom reduces the molecular weight and size, which generally lowers the melting point. However, the methylene bridge also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in ethylene, the additional methylene bridge allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methylene bridge into consideration, we can predict a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
