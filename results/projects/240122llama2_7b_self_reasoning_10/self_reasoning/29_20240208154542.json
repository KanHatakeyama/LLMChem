    "Reason": "3-heptene has a melting point of around 5 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of three additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the heptene ring introduces a rigid structure, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
