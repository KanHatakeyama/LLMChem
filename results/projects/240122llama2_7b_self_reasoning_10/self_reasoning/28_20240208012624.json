    "Reason": "3-chloropropionitrile has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is propionitrile, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
