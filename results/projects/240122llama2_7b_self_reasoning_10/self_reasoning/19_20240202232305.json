    "Reason": "4-Methoxybenzylidene group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group's effect might be around +5\u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The phenyl group's effect might be around +20\u00b0C due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. The oxazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +2\u00b0C.",
