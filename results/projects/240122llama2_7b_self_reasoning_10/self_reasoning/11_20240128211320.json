    "Reason": "2-ethylhexylacetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit, hexylacetate, has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two ethyl groups (C(C)OCC) increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group (O=C(C)OCC) forms a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups (CCCC) introduces additional rigid structures and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
