    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The basic unit of analysis is the 1,2-propanediol moiety, which on its own exhibits intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thus increasing the melting point. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point due to decreased hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -2 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
