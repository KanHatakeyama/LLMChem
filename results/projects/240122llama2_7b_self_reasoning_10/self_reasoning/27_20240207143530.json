    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The dioxane-like bridging moiety would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
