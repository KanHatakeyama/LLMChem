    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the aniline ring introduces two phenyl groups, which would notably augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point. The nitro group also introduces a strong withdrawing group, which raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The exact impact of the nitro group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate its effect as a rough estimate.",
