    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure and a diene conjugated system, which can contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius. The alcohol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
