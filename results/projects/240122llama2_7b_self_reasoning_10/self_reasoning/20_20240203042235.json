    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be pyridine, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The introduction of five chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C per group, totaling +50\u00b0C. The chlorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
