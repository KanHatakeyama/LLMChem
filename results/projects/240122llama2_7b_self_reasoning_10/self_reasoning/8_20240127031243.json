    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of anthracene, which is around 100\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The additional molecular weight and van der Waals interactions from the two additional phenyl groups are estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C each, totaling +40\u00b0C. The anthracene base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C.",
