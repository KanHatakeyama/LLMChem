    "Reason": "2,5-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two nitro groups introduces strong withdrawing groups, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C each. The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The dinitro group introduces two additional nitro functionalities, which can participate in dipole interactions, further raising the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C.",
