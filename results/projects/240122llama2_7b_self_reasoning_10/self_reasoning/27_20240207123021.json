    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The hydroxylamine group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
