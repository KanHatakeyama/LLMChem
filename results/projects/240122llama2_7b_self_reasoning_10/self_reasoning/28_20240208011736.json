    "Reason": "5-formyl-2-methoxybenzeneboronic acid has a melting point that we can compare to by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxybenzene, which has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5 to +10 degrees Celsius. The formyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 to +10 degrees Celsius. The boronic acid moiety introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 to +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
