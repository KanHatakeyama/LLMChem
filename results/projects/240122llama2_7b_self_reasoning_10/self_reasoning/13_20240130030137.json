    "Reason": "2-Vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 2-vinyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to benzene, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Benzene base (+5.5\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+10\u00b0C), and one vinyl group (-10\u00b0C).",
