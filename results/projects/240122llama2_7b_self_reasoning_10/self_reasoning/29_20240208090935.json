    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to cyclopentene, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C.",
