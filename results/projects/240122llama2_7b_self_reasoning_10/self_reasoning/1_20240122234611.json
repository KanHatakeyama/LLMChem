    "Reason": "4-fluorophenyl and trifluoromethyl groups are known to increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and increased molecular weight. The fluorine substituents in the phenyl and trifluoromethyl groups can increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius each, totaling +30 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The carboxylate group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which may slightly lower the melting point, estimated at -5 degrees Celsius.",
