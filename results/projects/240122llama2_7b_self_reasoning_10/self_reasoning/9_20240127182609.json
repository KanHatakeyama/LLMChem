    "Reason": "3-chlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The trifluoromethyl group also introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of three fluorine atoms can also increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius each.",
