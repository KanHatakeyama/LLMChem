    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. Additionally, the 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius.",
