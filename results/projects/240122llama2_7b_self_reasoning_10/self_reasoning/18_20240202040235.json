    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The introduction of the chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the aldehyde group, which raises it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also increases the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the aldehyde group, which raises it by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
