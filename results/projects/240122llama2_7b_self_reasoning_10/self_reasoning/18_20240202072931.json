    "Reason": "1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-Octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane has a melting point that is influenced by its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1,4-diiodobutane, which has a melting point of -10.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The iodine atom also contributes to the melting point due to the presence of a dipole, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The fluorine and iodine atoms also increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
