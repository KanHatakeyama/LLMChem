    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the benzamide structure can contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a benzene ring, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
