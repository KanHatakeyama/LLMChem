    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of the methazolamide structure introduces additional functional groups that can influence the melting point. The methazolamide structure includes a nitro group, which can increase the melting point due to the presence of a strong dipole moment and increased molecular weight. The nitro group can raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methazolamide structure includes a methoxy group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The structure also includes a sulfur atom, which can increase the melting point due to the presence of a sulfur atom and the potential for additional functional groups. The sulfur atom can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
