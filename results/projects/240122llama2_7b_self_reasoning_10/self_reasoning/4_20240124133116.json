    "Reason": "9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group can increase the melting point due to the presence of a fluorenyl group, which can enhance pi-pi interactions and rigidity. The fluorenyl group can contribute approximately +30\u00b0C to the melting point. The carbonyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The succinimide group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which might add approximately +10\u00b0C.",
