    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The benzyl group (C1=CC=CC=C1) adds approximately +20 \u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The thiosemicarbazide moiety (N=C=S) adds approximately +30 \u00b0C due to the presence of a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The benzene ring also contributes to the melting point, estimated at +20 \u00b0C.",
