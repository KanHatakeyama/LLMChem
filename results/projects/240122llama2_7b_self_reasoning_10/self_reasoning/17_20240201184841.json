    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups (3 and 4) increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
