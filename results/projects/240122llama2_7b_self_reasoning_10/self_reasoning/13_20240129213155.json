    "Reason": "2-chlorine substitution generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The benzotriazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one chlorine atom, we have +10\u00b0C total (lesser due to the small size and limited ability to disrupt the crystal lattice), one methyl group at -10\u00b0C, and one benzotriazole ring at +70\u00b0C.",
