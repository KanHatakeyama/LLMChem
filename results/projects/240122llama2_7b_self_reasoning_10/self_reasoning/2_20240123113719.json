    "Reason": "1. Maleimide group: The maleimide group itself can contribute to the melting point due to its rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding. The maleimide group can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. \n2. Phenyl group: The presence of a phenyl group can significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. \n3. Nitro group: The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
