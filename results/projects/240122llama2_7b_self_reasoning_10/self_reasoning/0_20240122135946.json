    "Reason": "Hexachlorophene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a complex molecular structure. The basic unit for comparison can be anthracene, which has a melting point of 105.5 \u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). Hexachlorophene has six fused benzene rings, which significantly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi interactions. Each additional benzene ring can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the chlorine atoms within the molecule can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and polarizability.",
