    "Reason": "1,1'-Octadodecanamine has a melting point of 10.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be octane, which has a melting point of -11.2\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional methyl groups, which increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, leading to a higher melting point. Additionally, the amine group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further contribute to the melting point.",
