    "Reason": "1,1'-Bis(phenylmethyl)propane, the base unit for comparison, has a melting point of -106.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications in Penicillamine will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The methyl group (S) reduces the melting point by approximately -10 due to reducing the molecular weight and volume. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
