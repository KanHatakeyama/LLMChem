    "Reason": "2-Methylcyclopentanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit, cyclopentanone, has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
