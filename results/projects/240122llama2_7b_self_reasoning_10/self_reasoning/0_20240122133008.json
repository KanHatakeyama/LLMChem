    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point of 120\u00b0C. The basic unit is hydroquinone, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The presence of a phenyl group increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The phenyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
