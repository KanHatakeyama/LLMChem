    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two carbonyl groups, which generally increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C, which can contribute to the total melting point.",
