    "Reason": "2-chloroethyl sulfide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethyl sulfide, which has a melting point of -11.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The chlorine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher electronegativity and the capacity to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The sulfur atom also contributes to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The two chlorine atoms can also participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
