    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl group: The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their high electronegativity, estimated at +10\u00b0C each.",
