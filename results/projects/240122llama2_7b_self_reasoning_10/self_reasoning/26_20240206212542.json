    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The azide group introduces a nitrogen with a high electronegativity, which can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The effects are additive.",
