    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The benzamide-like bridging moiety introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +2 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzamide-like bridging moiety introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius.",
