    "Reason": "9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, raising the melting point by approximately +40 \u00b0C. The fluorenyl group itself contributes to the melting point due to its high molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at +30 \u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
