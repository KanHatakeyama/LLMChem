    "Reason": "1-Pyrrolidinyl substitution tends to increase the melting point compared to phenol, as it creates a more rigid structure with a higher melting point. The pyrrolidinyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to an increase in melting point. The exact impact depends on the specific compound and the degree of hydrogen bonding. For 1-pyrrolidinyl substitution, we can estimate a net increase of approximately +20\u00b0C due to additional rigid structures and hydrogen bonding.",
