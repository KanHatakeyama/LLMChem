    "Reason": "1-oxoindane has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which can increase the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and the increase in molecular weight. The carboxylic acid group can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the oxo group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase the molecular weight. The exact impact of these structural modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
