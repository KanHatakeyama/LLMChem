    "Reason": "1,1'-propellane has a melting point around 30 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be 1,1'-propellane, which has a melting point of 30 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in p-chlorobenzyl_mercaptan will affect its melting point: (1) The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. (2) The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure and a diene conjugated system, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
