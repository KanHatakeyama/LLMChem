    "Reason": "3,3,3-trifluoro-N-(1-methylpropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components: (1) The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant increase due to its strong electronegativity, which raises the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. (2) The methyl group introduces a small increase due to its additional molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. (3) The propanamide group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. (4) The trifluoromethyl group also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
