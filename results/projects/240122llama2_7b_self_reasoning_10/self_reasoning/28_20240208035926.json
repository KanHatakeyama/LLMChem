    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius. The benzamide group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
