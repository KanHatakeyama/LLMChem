    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2-phenylhydroquinone will affect its melting point: (1) The phenyl group (c1ccc(cc1)c2cc(ccc2O)) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius; (2) The hydroquinone moiety (O) introduces two phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius.",
