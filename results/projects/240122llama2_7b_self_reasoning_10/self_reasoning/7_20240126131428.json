    "Reason": "4',4'-Bis(methyl-2-phenyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one) has a melting point that we will compare to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, which would significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the bromomethylenyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
