    "Reason": "2-Methylaziridine has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is N-methyl-2-phenyl-2-aziridine, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The aziridine ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at +30 degrees Celsius.",
