    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each methoxy group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the nitramine ring introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
