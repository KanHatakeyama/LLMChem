    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The aniline ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
