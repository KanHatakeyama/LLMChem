    "Reason": "1,1,2,3-Tetramethylpyrazine has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of four methyl groups. Methyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 1,1,2,3-Tetramethylpyrazine, we have four additional methyl groups linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional methyl group can be estimated to add approximately 10\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
