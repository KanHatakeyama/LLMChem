    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, and two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The benzamide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30 degrees Celsius. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight.",
