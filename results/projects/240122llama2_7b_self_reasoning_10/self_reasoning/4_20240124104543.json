    "Reason": "1,2-propanedione has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional methyl groups, which increase the molecular weight and size, and the presence of a methoxy group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The methoxy group can be estimated to add approximately 10 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding potential. The additional methyl groups can be estimated to add approximately 20 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and size.",
