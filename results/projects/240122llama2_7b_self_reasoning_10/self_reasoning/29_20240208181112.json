    "Reason": "2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl alcohol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of three methyl groups and one benzyl group can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methyl groups can add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The benzyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a rigid structure.",
