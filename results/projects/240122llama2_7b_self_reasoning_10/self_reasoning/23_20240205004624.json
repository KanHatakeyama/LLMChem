    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene (cis) has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The introduction of the chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the carbon atom, which raises it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The cis-configuration also introduces some rigidity, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
