    "Reason": "1,1'-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
