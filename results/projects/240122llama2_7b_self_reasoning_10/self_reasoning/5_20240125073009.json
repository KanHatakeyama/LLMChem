    "Reason": "1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The presence of four chlorine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity of chlorine, which raises the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C for each chlorine atom. The tert-butyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
