    "Reason": "4-cyano-4'-n-heptyloxybiphenyl has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is biphenyl, which has a melting point of 5\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The heptyloxy group adds bulkiness and hydrogen bonding potential, contributing around +20\u00b0C. The nitrogen atom also participates in hydrogen bonding, adding +5\u00b0C. The total contribution from these functional groups is approximately +60\u00b0C.",
