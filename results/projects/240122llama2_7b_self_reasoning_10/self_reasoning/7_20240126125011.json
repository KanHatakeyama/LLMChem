    "Reason": "Naproanilide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. Naproanilide has two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The molecular structure also includes two phenyl groups, which can raise the melting point by approximately +30 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Additionally, naproanilide has a nitro group, which can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase molecular rigidity. The nitro group can add approximately +10 \u00b0C to the melting point.",
