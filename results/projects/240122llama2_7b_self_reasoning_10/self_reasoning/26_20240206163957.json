    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The methyl group also introduces a new hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
