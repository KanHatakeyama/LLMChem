    "Reason": "1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to the base of butanedioic acid, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the methyl group introduces a new hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point. However, the 1-ethyl substitution also reduces the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: -10\u00b0C for the 1-ethyl substitution and -106.0 degrees Celsius for the base.",
