    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The stilbene ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
