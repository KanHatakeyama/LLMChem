    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of a chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The aldehyde group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The dichloro group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one chlorine atom and one aldehyde group, we have +50\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), +20\u00b0C for the dichloro group, and +10\u00b0C for the aldehyde group (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system). This totals to an adjusted predicted increase of +80\u00b0C.",
