    "Reason": "2,4-dibromobenzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius each. Additionally, the presence of two phenyl groups can contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius each.",
