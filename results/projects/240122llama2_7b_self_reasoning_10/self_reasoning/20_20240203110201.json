    "Reason": "4-methyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group, a nitro group, and a sulfonamide group. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C.",
