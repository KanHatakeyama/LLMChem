    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +10. The carbamate group introduces additional rigid structures and hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20. The effects are additive.",
