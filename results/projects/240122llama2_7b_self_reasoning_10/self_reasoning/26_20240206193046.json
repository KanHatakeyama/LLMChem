    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is imidazole, which has a melting point of -15.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular rigidity. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the carbonyl group introduces a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
