    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanol, also known as benzadox, has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups in benzadox increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius each. Additionally, the nitro group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Finally, the methoxy group can increase the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
