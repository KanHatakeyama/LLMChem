    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is phenyl, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of an ether linkage can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the rigidity introduced by the ether linkage. The ether linkage can contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C to the melting point.",
