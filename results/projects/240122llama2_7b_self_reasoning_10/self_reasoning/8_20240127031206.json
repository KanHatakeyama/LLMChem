    "Reason": "1-hexene has a melting point of -169.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of one additional hexane chain. The additional carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which would raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
