    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point: 106\u00b0C. Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methyl group introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The ether linkage reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to reduced hydrogen bonding potential. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to reduced hydrogen bonding potential. The phenyl group introduces a more rigid structure, which might increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.
