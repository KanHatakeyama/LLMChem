    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The phenoxy group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
