    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the tert-butyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the acrylate group (\u2013CO\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C. The tert-butyl group also increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point.",
