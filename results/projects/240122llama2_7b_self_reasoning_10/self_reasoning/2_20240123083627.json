    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The methyl group (-CH3) generally lowers the melting point due to the reduction of molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding potential. The phenyl group, on the other hand, tends to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The presence of both functional groups in the molecule will contribute to the melting point in different ways. The phenyl group can add approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, while the methyl group can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: 4-phenylbenzoate base (100\u00b0C), methyl group (-10\u00b0C), and phenyl group (20\u00b0C).",
