    "Reason": "1-Isouron has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is caffeine, which has a melting point of around 239 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1-isouron will affect its melting point: (1) The methoxy group (O-C(=O)O-) adds approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The ethoxy group (O-C(=O)CH3) adds approximately +5 due to adding more rigidity to the structure; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) adds roughly +20 due to adding more rigidity to the structure; (4) The methyl group (C) adds approximately +5 due to adding more rigidity to the structure. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
