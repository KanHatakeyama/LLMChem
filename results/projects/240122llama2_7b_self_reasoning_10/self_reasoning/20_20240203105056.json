    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group raises the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
