    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. Two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the benzene ring introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C.",
