    "Reason": "1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to stilbene, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The stilbene ring itself has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C due to the presence of two phenyl groups and the rigidity they bring.",
