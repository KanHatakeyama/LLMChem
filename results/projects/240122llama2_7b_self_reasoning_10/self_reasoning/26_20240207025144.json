    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two ethoxy groups (\u2013OCH3) in place of two hydrogen atoms increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. Each ethoxy group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the acetate group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
