    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 30 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a significant increase due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydroxyl group.",
