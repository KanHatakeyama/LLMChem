    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl is a bulky group which introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight. Each morpholinyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further increasing the melting point. The nitro group also introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point. The presence of two carbonyl groups also raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.
