    "Reason": "1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane has a melting point that we can compare to butane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two epoxide groups increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius per group. The epoxide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30 degrees Celsius.",
