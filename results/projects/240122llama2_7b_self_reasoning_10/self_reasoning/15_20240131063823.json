    "Reason": "5-(4-morpholinyl)-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: The basic unit for comparison is 2-nitrophenol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The morpholinyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The 4-morpholinyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20. The nitro group also introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
