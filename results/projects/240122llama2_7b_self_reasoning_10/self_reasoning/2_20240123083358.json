    "Reason": "Xanthene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered as a benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of additional fused rings increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. The exact impact of ring formation is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of each additional fused ring as approximately +25\u00b0C.",
