    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl is a bulky group which adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50. The morpholine ring itself adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C).",
