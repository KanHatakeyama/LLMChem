    "Reason": "4-Fluorophenyl group: The fluorine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
