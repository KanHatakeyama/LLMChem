    "Reason": "3-pentanol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of three phenyl groups, which would add approximately +60 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
