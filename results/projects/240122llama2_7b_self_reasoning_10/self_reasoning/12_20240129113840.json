    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-cyanopyridine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The pyridine ring introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The bromine atom raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
