    "Reason": "3-chloropropionitrile has a melting point that we can compare to propionitrile, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The chlorine atom also introduces a strong dipole moment, which increases intermolecular forces and raises the melting point. The chlorine atom also increases the electronegativity, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular polarity. The net effect is a significant increase in the melting point due to both molecular size and dipole-dipole interactions.",
