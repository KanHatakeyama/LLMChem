    "Reason": "4-Morpholinylmethyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of morpholine, which has a melting point of around -100 degrees Celsius. The morpholine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around -100 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also adds to the melting point due to its effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
