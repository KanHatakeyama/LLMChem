    "Reason": "1H-carbazole has a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C due to its rigid structure and the presence of aromatic rings. The basic unit for this compound can be considered benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of additional fused aromatic rings increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. Each additional fused ring adds approximately +25\u00b0C to the melting point.",
