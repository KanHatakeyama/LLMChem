    "Reason": "2-Amino-3,5-dimethylphenyl and phenyl groups both contribute to the melting point. The amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C each. The phenyl group, with its additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, raises the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The methyl group within the phenyl ring also contributes to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
