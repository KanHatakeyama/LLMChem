    "Reason": "1,4-dione base, with a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two carbonyl groups, which can participate in dipole interactions and rigidify the structure. Each carbonyl group may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C. The pyridine ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methylamino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
