    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole has a melting point influenced by its structural components. The basic unit, imidazole, has a melting point of -15.5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The methylene bridge introduces additional molecular weight, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The nitrogen within the imidazole ring participates in hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius.",
