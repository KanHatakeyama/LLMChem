    "Reason": "2,5-dinitrophenol has a melting point of 100.0 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be phenol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two nitro groups (\u2013NO2) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the nitro group also introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase intermolecular forces and melting point. The net effect is a significant increase in melting point due to both molecular size and dipole interactions.",
