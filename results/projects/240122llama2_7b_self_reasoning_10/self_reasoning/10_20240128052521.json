    "Reason": "1-aspartic acid has a melting point of around -100 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The aspartic acid group also has a significant impact on the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and create a more rigid structure. The exact impact of these functional groups is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the benzyl group as +20 to +30 degrees Celsius and the carbonyl group as +10 to +20 degrees Celsius. The aspartic acid group might contribute +30 to +50 degrees Celsius due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and create a more rigid structure.",
