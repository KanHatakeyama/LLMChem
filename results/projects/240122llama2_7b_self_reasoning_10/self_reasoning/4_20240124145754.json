    "Reason": "2-hydroxyimino group can increase the melting point due to the presence of a hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The propanoic acid group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can add approximately +10\u00b0C.",
