    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of six methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the isocyanate group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The methyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C each.",
