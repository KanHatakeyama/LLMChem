    "Reason": "2-Fluoro-4-nitrobenzoic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 4-nitrobenzoic acid, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, estimated at around -10\u00b0C.",
