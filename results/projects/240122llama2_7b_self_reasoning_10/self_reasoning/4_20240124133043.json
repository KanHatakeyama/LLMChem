    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. (2) The two phenyl groups add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. (3) The hydroquinone moiety (O) introduces a rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute approximately +20. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
