    "Reason": "2-chloroethyl sulfide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of ethyl vinyl ether, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethyl vinyl ether, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The sulfur atom also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The chlorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
