    "Reason": "1,1'-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The cyclohexyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, which raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The toluene sulfonate group introduces a polar carbonyl-like functionalities, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
