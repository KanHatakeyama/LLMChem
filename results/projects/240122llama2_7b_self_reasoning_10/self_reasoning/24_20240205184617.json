    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base of anthracene. Anthracene itself has a melting point of 106.5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The nitro group also introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The nitro group's effect might be around +20 degrees Celsius.",
