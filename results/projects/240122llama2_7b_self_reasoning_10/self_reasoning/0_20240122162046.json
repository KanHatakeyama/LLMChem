    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point of 120-125\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The nitro group can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, which can destabilize the molecule and increase the melting point. The exact impact of the nitro group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
