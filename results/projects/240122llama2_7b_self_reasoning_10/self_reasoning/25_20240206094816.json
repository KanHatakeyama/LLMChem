    "Reason": "4-Ethyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The phenol group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
