    "Reason": "3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The trifluoromethyl group (\u2013F\u2013) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 3 fluorines) = 45 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the phenyl group (C1=CC=CC=C1) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carboxy group (C(=O)O) introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group (C(=O)C) adds a rigid structure and molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
