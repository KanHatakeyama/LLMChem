    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, due to the presence of two phenyl groups and a methyl group. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methyl group can add approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
