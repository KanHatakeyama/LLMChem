    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene is a modified benzene molecule with two chloromethyl groups attached to the 1,2-position. The presence of these groups will increase the molecular weight and introduce polar functional groups, which can enhance intermolecular interactions and increase the melting point. The chlorine atoms also introduce a significant dipole moment, which can further contribute to the melting point. The exact impact of these modifications is difficult to estimate without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, a rough estimate can be made by considering the increase in molecular weight and the presence of polar functional groups. The increase in molecular weight is approximately +20% due to the two chloromethyl groups, which can contribute +40\u00b0C to the melting point. The polar functional groups can contribute +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased intermolecular interactions. Therefore, the total estimated increase in melting point is approximately +60\u00b0C.",
