    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point: 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C). Additionally, Voriconazole has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including a 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperazine-2,3-dione base, two fused aromatic rings, and a dioxane-like bridging moiety. The methylenepiperazine base itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The two additional phenyl rings add more molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at +40 \u00b0C each. The dioxane-like bridging moiety also adds rigidity, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. Lastly, the fluorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 \u00b0C.",
