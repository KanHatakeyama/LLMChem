    "Reason": "3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid has a melting point that we can compare to benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The nitro functional group (\u2013NO2) can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl ester group (\u2013CH3) can also contribute to the melting point, as it creates a more rigid structure and increases the molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
