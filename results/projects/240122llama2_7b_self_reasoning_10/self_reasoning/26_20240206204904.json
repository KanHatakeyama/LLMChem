    "Reason": "4-Nhac-2266-tetrame-piperidin-n-oxide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. Starting with the basic unit of piperidine, which has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius, we have substantial structural components to consider. The compound has four methoxy groups, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The piperidine ring formation introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The tetramethylene structure can contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The oxo-functional group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
