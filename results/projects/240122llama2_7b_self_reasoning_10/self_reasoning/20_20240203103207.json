    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The phenyl group, when connected to a piperazine ring, increases the melting point due to the additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C for each phenyl group. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The ether linkage can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent, estimated at around +2\u00b0C.",
