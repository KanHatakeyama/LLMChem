    "Reason": "1,3,4-Oxadiazole ring formation introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +70\u00b0C. Naphthyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each naphthyl group may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C. Additionally, the oxadiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +70\u00b0C.",
