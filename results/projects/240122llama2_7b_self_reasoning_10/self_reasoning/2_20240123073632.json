    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be methanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a tert-butyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The acrylate group (\u2013CO\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the molecular rigidity and crystalline structure. The tert-butyl group can also enhance the melting point due to its ability to increase the molecular weight and size.",
