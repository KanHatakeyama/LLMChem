    "Reason": "3-chloropropionitrile has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The propionitrile group itself does not significantly contribute to the melting point, but it can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may lower it by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom's effect dominates, raising the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
