    "Reason": "1,3-Butanediamide has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of a nitrogen atom also introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methyl groups also introduce rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, which can further raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The exact impact of these structural modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, considering the combined effect of the methyl groups and nitrogen atom, we can estimate a total increase of +60\u00b0C.",
