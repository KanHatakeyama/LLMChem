    "Reason": "1,3-propanedioic acid, oxo-, diethyl ester has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The oxo-functionalities and ester linkage introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +40\u00b0C per group, totaling +80\u00b0C.",
