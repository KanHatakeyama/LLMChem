    "Reason": "1,2-Diphenyl-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (methaqualone) has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered as 1,2-diphenyl-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The introduction of methyl and phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius, while the phenyl group adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group (N3C) can increase the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and the increased molecular weight. The carbonyl group (C=O) can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can contribute to the melting point.",
