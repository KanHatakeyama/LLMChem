    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalene ring formation introduces two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the carbamate group (O=C(Nc1ccccc1)C(C)Oc2ccc3ccccc3c2) introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20 \u00b0C.",
