    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the aspartic acid moiety can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10. The methylene bridge can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +5.",
