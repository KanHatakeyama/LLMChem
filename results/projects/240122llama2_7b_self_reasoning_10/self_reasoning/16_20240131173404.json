    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atoms increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. The pentachloro group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring formation introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
