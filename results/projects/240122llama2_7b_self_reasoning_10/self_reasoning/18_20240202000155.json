    "Reason": "3-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl isocyanate has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxycarbonyl group, which introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the isocyanate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
