    "Reason": "2-methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group also introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
