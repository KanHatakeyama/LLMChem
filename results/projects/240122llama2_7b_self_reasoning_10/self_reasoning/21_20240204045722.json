    "Reason": "1E-N,N'-bis(4-methylphenyl)-2-[(4-methylphenyl)amino]ethanimidamide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is ethanimidamide, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The 4-methylphenyl group introduces a more rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring introduces a more rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methylene bridge introduces a more rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
