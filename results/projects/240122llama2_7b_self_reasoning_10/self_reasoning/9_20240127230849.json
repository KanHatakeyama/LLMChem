    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C. The presence of a 2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional functional group and the rigidity it brings. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The hydroxyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. The exact impact of these functional groups can be estimated as follows: The methyl group can add approximately +10 due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential; the hydroxyl group can add approximately +5 due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential.",
