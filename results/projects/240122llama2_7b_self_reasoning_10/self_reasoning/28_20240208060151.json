    "Reason": "1-benzyl-3-phenyl-2-(phenylhydrazono)propylidene and phenylhydrazine functionalities significantly impact the melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups and a benzyl group can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may add approximately +100 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can contribute approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a benzene ring. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30. The phenyl group in the hydrazono ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30.",
