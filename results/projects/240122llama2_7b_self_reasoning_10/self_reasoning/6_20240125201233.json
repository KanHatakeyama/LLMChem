    "Reason": "1,1-propanedioic acid has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group and an amino group. The phenyl group, when linked to a benzene ring, tends to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi interactions, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C.",
