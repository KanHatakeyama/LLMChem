    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two fused aromatic rings, which significantly increase the melting point due to pi-stacking interactions and molecular rigidity. Each additional fused ring can add approximately +25\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the xanthene structure has a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5\u00b0C for this structural feature.",
