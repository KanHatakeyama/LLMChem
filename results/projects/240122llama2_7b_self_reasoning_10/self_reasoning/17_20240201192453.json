    "Reason": "1-pyrrolidinyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in the molecule will affect the melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +30 to +50\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The pyrrolidinyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10\u00b0C; (3) The methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5\u00b0C.",
