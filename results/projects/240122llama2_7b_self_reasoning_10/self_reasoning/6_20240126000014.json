    "Reason": "1,3-Benzodioxole has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The methylene bridge (\u2013CH2\u2013) adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to reducing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The benzodioxole ring itself contributes approximately +20\u00b0C due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The thiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The pyrimidine ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methylene bridge reduces the symmetry and creates more rigid structure, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
