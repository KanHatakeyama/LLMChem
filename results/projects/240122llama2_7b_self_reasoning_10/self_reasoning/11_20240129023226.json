    "Reason": "1,3-Thiazole ring: The presence of a 1,3-thiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
