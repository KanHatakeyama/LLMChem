    "Reason": "1-Proline, 1-acetyl-4-hydroxy-trans has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is glycine, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The acetyl group (C(=O)O) adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The hydroxy group (\u2013OH) can raise the melting point by +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The 4-hydroxy group (\u2013OH) can also contribute +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The trans configuration can also contribute +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular rigidity.",
