    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,1-propanediol, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group also increases the molecular weight and size, which might raise the melting point by +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) has a slight lowering effect, around -2 degrees Celsius. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point but not as high as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
