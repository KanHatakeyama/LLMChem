    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyl compounds, such as the one in julocrotine, tend to increase the melting point due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds. Each carbonyl group can form approximately two hydrogen bonds, which can contribute to the melting point. The presence of two carbonyl groups in julocrotine should significantly increase the melting point due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds.",
