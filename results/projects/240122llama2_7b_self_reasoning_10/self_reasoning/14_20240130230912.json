    "Reason": "1E-N,N'-bis(4-methylphenyl)-2-[(4-methylphenyl)amino]ethanimidamide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. Starting with the basic unit of ethanimidamide, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The methylphenyl group (C)cc1ccccc1 adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The 4-methylphenyl group (C)ccccc1 adds more rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl group (C)ccccc1 reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -10\u00b0C. The piperidine ring (Nc1ccc(C)cc1) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methylene bridge (Nc1ccc(C)cc1) reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -10\u00b0C.",
