    "Reason": "3,3,3-trifluoro-N-(1-methylpropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. Starting with the basic unit of propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The trifluoromethyl group (F) introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The methyl group (C) adds approximately +5 \u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The fluorine atoms (F) significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C each. The nitrogen atom (N) introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group (C=O) introduces a strong hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group (F) also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
