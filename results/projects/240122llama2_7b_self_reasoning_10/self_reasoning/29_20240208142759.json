    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the structural modifications of a benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure and a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The azide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The sulfur atom also introduces a rigid structure and a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
