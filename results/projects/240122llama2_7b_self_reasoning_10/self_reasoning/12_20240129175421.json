    "Reason": "4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for our comparison will be 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and an allyl group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The allyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
