    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethylbarbituric acid has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is barbituric acid, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of four methyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each methyl group might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. Additionally, the carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, contributing around +10\u00b0C.",
