    "Reason": "4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine has a melting point that we will compare to the base of piperidine, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine atom can contribute approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the phenyl group (C2(CCNCC2)O) adds rigidity and molecular weight, which can contribute approximately +20\u00b0C.",
