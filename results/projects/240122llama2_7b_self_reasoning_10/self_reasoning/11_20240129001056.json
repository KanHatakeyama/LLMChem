    "Reason": "3,5-diphenyl-1H-pyrazole has a melting point that we can compare to the melting point of pyrazole, which has a melting point of 106.5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
