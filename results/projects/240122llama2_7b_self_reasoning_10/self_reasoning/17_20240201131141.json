    "Reason": "1,3-dodecanediamine has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is 1,3-dodecanediamine, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in tri-n-dodecylamine will affect its melting point: (1) Three phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact.",
