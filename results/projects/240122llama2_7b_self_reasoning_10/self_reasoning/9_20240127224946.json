    "Reason": "2-Methylaziridine has a melting point that we can compare to ethanal, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The aziridine ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding. The exact impact of the aziridine ring is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the methyl group and aziridine ring as follows: Methyl group: +10\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications). Aziridine ring: +20\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
