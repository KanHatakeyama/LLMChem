    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The anhydride functionalities can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5.",
