    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two methoxy groups, a benzyl group, and an acetyl group. The methoxy groups increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, approximately +10\u00b0C each. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The acetyl group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C.",
