    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two ethoxy groups (\u2013OCH3) increases the molecular weight and size, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, lowering the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The ethoxy groups also increase the molecular weight and size, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The net effect is a decreased melting point due to the additional hydrogen bonding potential of the ethoxy groups, but the increased molecular weight and size from the acetate group dominate.",
