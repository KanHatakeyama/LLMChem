    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of -95.0 degrees Celsius. The iodine atom introduces a significant increase due to the formation of iodine-containing compounds, which have a higher melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a halogen. The iodine atom also increases the melting point due to the formation of iodine-containing compounds, which have a higher melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a halogen. The iodine atom also increases the melting point due to the formation of iodine-containing compounds, which have a higher melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a halogen.",
