    "Reason": "1,1-Formate is a simple compound with a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a hexyl group. The hexyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +120\u00b0C. The formate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +30\u00b0C.",
