    "Reason": "1,3-Dimethylpyrrolidine has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered pyrrolidine, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in pyrinoline will affect its melting point: (1) The methyl groups (1,3-dimethyl) add approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The pyrrole ring (C1=CC(C=C1)=C) adds roughly +20 due to adding more rigidity and planarity to the structure; (3) The methylene bridge (c2ccccn2) adds approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (4) The ethylene bridge (c3ccccn3) adds roughly +5 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (5) The methylene bridge (c4ccccn4) adds approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (6) The ethylene bridge (c5ccccn5) adds roughly +5 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
