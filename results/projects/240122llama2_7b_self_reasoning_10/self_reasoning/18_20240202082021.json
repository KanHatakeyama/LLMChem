    "Reason": "1,2-dihydroacenaphthylen-5-yl and phenyl groups both contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The quinoxaline base itself has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C due to the presence of a planar, aromatic ring. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The piperidine ring formation introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may add roughly +20 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The effects are additive.",
