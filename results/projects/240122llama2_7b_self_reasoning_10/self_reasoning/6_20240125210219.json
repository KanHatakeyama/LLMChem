    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, contributing around +30\u00b0C. The azide group introduces a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, contributing around +20\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
