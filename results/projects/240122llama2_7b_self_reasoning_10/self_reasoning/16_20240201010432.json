    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methacryloyl group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
