    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong dipole moment, increasing intermolecular interactions and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the phenyl group can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. The exact impact of these functional groups is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the nitro group as a rough estimate.",
