    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,5-difluorobenzoic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, a fluorine atom, and an amino group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The fluorine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
