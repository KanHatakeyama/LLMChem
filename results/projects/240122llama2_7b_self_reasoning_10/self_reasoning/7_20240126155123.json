    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline, the base unit, has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups increases the melting point due to additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius each. The tryptamine base itself has a melting point of around 106 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius each. The presence of two methoxy groups raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
