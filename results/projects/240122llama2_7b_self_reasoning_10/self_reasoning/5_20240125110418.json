    "Reason": "1,3-di-p-tolyl-2-thiourea has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The tolyl groups (1,3-di-p-tolyl) add approximately +20\u00b0C due to increasing molecular weight and rigidity. The thiourea group introduces a strong dipole moment, which raises the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups in the tolyl moiety increases the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
