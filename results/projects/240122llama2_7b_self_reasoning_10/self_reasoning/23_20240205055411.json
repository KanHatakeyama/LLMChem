    "Reason": "1,4-Naphthalenediol base, with a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two fused aromatic rings, which increase the melting point due to pi-stacking interactions and rigidity. Each chlorine atom can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The two methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the chlorine atom, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius each. The fused aromatic ring system introduces additional rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
