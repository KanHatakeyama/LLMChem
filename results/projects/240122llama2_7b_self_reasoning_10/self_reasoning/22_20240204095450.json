    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is furfuryl, which has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The isopropyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C.
