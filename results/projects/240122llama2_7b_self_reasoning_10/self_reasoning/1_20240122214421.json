    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The methyl group (-CH3) is a small, non-polar group that generally lowers the melting point due to the reduction of molecular weight and the loss of hydrogen bonding potential. The phenyl group, on the other hand, tends to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The presence of both groups in methyl 4-phenylbenzoate will have a complex effect on the melting point. The methyl group will lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C, while the phenyl group will increase it by approximately +20\u00b0C due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The exact contribution of each group depends on the specific structure and the degree of crystallinity, but a reasonable estimate is to consider a combined effect of -10\u00b0C for the methyl group and +20\u00b0C for the phenyl group, resulting in a net increase of +10\u00b0C.",
