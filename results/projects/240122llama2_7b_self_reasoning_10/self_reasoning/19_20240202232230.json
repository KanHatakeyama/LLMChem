    "Reason": "1-oxoindane has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the indane ring, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the carboxylic acid group (O=C(O)[C@H]2c1ccccc1C(=O)C2) increases the melting point due to the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and form a more rigid structure, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methyl group (c1ccccc1C) adds approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
