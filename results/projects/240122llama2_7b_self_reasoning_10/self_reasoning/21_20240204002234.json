    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, adding about +5 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The sulfone group (\u2013SO2\u2013) can form hydrogen bonds, contributing around +10. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
