    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a basic aromatic ring, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The two chlorine atoms attached to the benzene ring increase the molecular weight and polarity, which can lead to a higher melting point. The alcohol group can also contribute to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and polarity.",
