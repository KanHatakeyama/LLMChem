    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, based on the presence of a piperazine ring and a methyl group. The piperazine ring itself contributes to a rigid structure with hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C.",
