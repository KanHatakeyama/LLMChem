    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two chloromethyl groups (\u2013CH2Cl) in place of two hydrogen atoms increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the chlorine within the chloromethyl group also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
