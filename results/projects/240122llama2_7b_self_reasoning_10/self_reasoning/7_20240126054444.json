    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups in 4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide increases the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can contribute approximately +20 \u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the thiosemicarbazide moiety introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The benzyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
