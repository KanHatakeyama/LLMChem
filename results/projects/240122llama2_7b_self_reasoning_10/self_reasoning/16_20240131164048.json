    "Reason": "1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
