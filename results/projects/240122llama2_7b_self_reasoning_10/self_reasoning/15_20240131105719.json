    "Reason": "1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethynyl-4-n-pentylbenzene has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: The basic unit we can compare to is n-pentylbenzene, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenyl group (C(=O)c1ccc(cc1)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20. The ethynyl group (C#Cc2ccc(cc2)OC) introduces a double bond, which reduces the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at around -10. The pentyl group (CCCCC) adds molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +20. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
