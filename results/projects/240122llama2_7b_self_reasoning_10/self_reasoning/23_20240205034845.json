    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The alcohol group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
