    "Reason": "5-chloro-2-methoxy-4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for this compound can be considered 2-methoxybenzene, which has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 5-chloro-2-methoxy-4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride will affect its melting point: (1) The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius; (2) The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius; (3) The sulfonyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius; (4) The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
