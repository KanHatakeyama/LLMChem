    "Reason": "The compound under consideration contains a basic aromatic ring, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a phenyl group increases the melting point due to the ability to enhance pi-pi interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the carbonyl group (one from the ketone and one from the amide) can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20 to +40 degrees Celsius for each carbonyl. The amide linkage also has the potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing a similar effect as the carbonyl, so around +20 to +30 degrees Celsius. Finally, the alkenyl linkage may moderately increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces, estimated at around +5 to +10 degrees Celsius.",
