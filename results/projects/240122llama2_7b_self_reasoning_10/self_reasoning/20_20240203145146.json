    "Reason": "1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane has a melting point that we can compare to butane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two epoxide groups increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The epoxide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, further raising the melting point. The presence of two methyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, although their effect is less significant than the epoxide group. The methyl groups can increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
