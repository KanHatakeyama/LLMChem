    "Reason": "1,3-propanedioic acid, oxo-, diethyl ester has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The oxo group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The diethyl ester group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius per group, totaling +40 degrees Celsius.",
