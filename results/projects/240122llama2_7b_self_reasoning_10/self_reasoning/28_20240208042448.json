    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can add approximately +30 to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. The anhydride functionalities introduce additional carbonyl interactions, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The thiadiazole ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point.",
