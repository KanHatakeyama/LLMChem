    "Reason": "1-chlorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The methyl group also adds rigidity to the structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
