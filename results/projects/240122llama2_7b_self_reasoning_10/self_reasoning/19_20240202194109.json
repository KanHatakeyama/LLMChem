    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups and a hydroxyl group can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds. The phenyl groups can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds. The hydroxyl group can add approximately +5 due to the formation of hydrogen bonds.",
