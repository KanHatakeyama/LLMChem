    "Reason": "2-chloro-4,6-difluoroaniline has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: The basic unit we can compare to is 4-chloroanil, which has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2-chloro-4,6-difluoroaniline will affect its melting point: (1) The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. (2) The fluorine atoms increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each fluorine is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
