    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar interactions, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. Summing up these changes: 4-phenylbenzoate base (+100\u00b0C), one methyl group (+10\u00b0C), and one phenyl group (+20\u00b0C).",
