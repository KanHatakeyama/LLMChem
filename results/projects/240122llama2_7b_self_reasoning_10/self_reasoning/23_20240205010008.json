    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that piperazine itself has a melting point around that value. For the methyl group, let's say it reduces it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The decyl group will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces but will also introduce a rigid structure, which might raise it by +20 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group will also increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
