    "Reason": "4-ethoxyphenyl group: The ethoxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a rigid structure and a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to strong electronegativity and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups in N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide will affect its melting point: (1) The ethoxy group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +5\u00b0C; (2) The trifluoromethyl group introduces a rigid structure and a significant dipole moment, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C; (3) The fluorine atoms contribute to the melting point due to strong electronegativity and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each.",
