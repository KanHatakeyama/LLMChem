    "Reason": "9-methylanthracene has a melting point that we can compare to anthracene, which has a melting point of 100.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be anthracene, which has a melting point of 100.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of one additional phenyl group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 9-methylanthracene, we have one additional phenyl group linked in a linear fashion, which would augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
