    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison can be butane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the heptanoate group (\u2013COO\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The heptanoate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
