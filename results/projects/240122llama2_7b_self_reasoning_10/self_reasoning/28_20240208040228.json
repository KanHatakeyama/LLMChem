    "Reason": "1,3-propanedisil is a basic unit for comparison. The methyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The propyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +30\u00b0C. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +10\u00b0C.",
