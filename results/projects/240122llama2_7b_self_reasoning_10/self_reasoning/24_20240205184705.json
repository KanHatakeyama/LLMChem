    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. Two phenyl groups are present, which would significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the presence of a hydroxylamine group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C.",
