    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is n-heptane, which has a melting point of -11.2\u00b0C. The presence of additional carbon atoms and a longer chain increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each additional carbon atom can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
