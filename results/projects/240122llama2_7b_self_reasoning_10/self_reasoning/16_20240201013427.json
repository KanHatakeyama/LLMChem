    "Reason": "2-methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The aldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
