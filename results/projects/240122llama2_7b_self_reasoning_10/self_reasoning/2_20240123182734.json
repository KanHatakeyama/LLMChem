    "Reason": "4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is phenol, which has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C. The allyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013CH=CH2\u2013) adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The methoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) introduces a rigid structure and reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular mobility. The carbonyl group (C=O) adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. The overall effect of these structural components can be estimated as follows: Phenol base (-10\u00b0C), allyl group +20\u00b0C, methoxy group -10\u00b0C, and carbonyl group +20\u00b0C.",
