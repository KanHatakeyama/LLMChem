    "Reason": "1-chlorooctane has a melting point that we can compare to that of octane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atom can also participate in dipole interactions, which can further raise the melting point. The net effect is a significant increase due to both molecular size and hydrogen bonding.",
