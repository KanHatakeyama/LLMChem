    "Reason": "3,3'-thiodipropionic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the propionic acid moiety, which has a melting point around 10\u00b0C due to the presence of a carboxyl group and a methyl group. The thiol group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, estimated at around +5\u00b0C due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The carboxyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +60\u00b0C.",
