    "Reason": "3-(boc-amino)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is propionic acid, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (boc-amino) raises the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the propionic acid base might be considered to have a melting point around -10 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that propionic acid itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxy group, let's say it increases it by +5 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The amino group might raise it by +5 degrees Celsius due to additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
