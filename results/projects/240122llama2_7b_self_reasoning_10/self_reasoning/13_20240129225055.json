    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The furanyl group (C(C)C) and isopropyl group (C(C)C) add rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 each. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The carbonyl group (C=O) creates a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10. The nitro group (C=NO) introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30. The methyl group (C(C)C) adds a bulky side chain, estimated at around +5 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The isopropyl group (C(C)C) adds a bulky side chain, estimated at around +5 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The furanyl group (C(C)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20.",
