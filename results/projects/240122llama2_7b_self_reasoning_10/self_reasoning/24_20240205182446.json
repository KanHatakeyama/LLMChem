    "Reason": "4-iodobenzylamine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The amine group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at -5\u00b0C.",
