    "Reason": "The basic unit of this compound is phenol, which has a melting point of 95.5\u00b0C. The presence of two methyl groups on the phenyl ring can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the amino group can contribute to the melting point through increased molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. Finally, the methyl group on the alkyl chain can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
