    "Reason": "2-Amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine has a melting point that we can compare to pyridine, which has a melting point of 10.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be pyridine. The introduction of a fluorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings.
