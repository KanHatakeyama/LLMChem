    "Reason": "2-Methylcyclopentanone has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The cyclopentanone ring itself contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C.",
