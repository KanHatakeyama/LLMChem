    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde will affect its melting point: (1) The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. (2) The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. (3) The aldehyde group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
