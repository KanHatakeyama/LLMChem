    "Reason": "1-Propyl substitution generally lowers the melting point compared to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a more symmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which lowers the melting point by approximately -10 \u00b0C.",
