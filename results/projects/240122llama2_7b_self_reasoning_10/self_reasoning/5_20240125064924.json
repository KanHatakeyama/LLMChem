    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. (2) The two chlorine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C each. (3) The alcohol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C.",
