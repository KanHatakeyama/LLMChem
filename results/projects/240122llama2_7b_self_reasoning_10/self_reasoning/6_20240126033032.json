    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, propanediol, has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methoxy group can contribute around +20 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can also form hydrogen bonds, which adds to the melting point. The presence of two methoxy groups can contribute approximately +40 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The carbamate group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
