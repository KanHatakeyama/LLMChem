    "Reason": "3-sulfolene has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the sulfur atom and the sulfone group (\u2013O\u2013C(=O)\u2013) increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The sulfur atom also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) reduces the melting point by approximately -5\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydroxyl group.",
