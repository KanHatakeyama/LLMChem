    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the dodecamethylpentasiloxane structure has a high melting point due to the presence of siloxane bonds, which are known to increase the melting point due to their rigidity and molecular weight. Each siloxane bond is estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the presence of rigid structures and the increase in molecular weight.",
