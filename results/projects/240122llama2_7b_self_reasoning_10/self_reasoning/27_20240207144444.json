    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be the fluorinated ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a bromine atom increases the melting point due to the formation of a bromine-containing compound, which has a higher melting point than a fluorinated ethane. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius.",
