    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for our comparison will be oleic acid, which has a melting point of -11.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). 2. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The methyl group can add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
