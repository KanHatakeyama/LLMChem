    "Reason": "3-(boc-amino)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid has a melting point that we will compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is propionic acid, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The amino group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group can also participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
