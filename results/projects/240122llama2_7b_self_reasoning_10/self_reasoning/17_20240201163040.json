    "Reason": "2-fluoro-4-nitrobenzoic acid has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for our comparison is 4-nitrobenzoic acid, which has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. (2) The fluorine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. (3) The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
