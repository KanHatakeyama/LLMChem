    "Reason": "1,4-diphenylbutane-2,3-dione has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison is butane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
