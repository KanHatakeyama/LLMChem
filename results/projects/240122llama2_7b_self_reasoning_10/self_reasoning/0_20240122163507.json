    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is propane, which has a melting point of -89.4\u00b0C. The N-isopropyl substitution can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a bulky isopropyl group, which can disrupt hydrogen bonding and increase the molecular volume. The amine group can also contribute to the melting point by forming hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
