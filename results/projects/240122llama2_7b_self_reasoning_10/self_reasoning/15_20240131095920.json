    "Reason": "1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for this compound is 5-chlorotetrazole, which has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of four nitrogen atoms and the rigid structure they form. Each additional phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +5 due to dipole-dipole interactions and rigidifying the structure. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
