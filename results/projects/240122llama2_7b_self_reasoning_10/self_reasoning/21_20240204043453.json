    "Reason": "3-methoxyphenyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The propionic acid group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The effects are additive.",
