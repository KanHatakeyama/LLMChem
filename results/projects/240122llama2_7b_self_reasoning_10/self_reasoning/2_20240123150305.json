    "Reason": "4-methyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit is benzene, which has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C. (2) The methyl group (Cc1ccc) adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. (3) The nitro group (N+) can contribute approximately +20\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitro functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising the melting point. (4) The sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N) can add approximately +10\u00b0C due to the presence of a sulfonamide group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising the melting point.",
