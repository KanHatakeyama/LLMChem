    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethene, which has a melting point of -161.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the cis-configuration in the molecule creates a more rigid structure, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
