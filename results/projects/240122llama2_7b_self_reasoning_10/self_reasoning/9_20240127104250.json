    "Reason": "2-pyridinecarboxamide, 3-hydroxy- has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of 20 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a hydroxyl group and a carboxamide group. The hydroxyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The carboxamide group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
