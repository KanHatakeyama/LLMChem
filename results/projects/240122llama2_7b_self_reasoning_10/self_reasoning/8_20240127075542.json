    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two ethoxy groups (\u2013O\u2013CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Each ethoxy group can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased hydrogen bonding and rigidity. Additionally, the acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and further contribute to the melting point. The carbonyl group can be estimated to add approximately +30 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a polar functional group.",
