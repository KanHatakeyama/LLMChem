    "Reason": "1-aspartic acid has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of a benzyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The aspartic acid group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The benzyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and additional molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
