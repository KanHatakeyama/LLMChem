    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. (2) The two chlorine atoms increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
