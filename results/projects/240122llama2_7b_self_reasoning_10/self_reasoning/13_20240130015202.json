    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C; (2) The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C.",
