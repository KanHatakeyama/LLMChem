    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, based on the presence of a piperazine ring and a methyl group. The piperazine ring introduces rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can sterically hinder the crystal lattice, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
