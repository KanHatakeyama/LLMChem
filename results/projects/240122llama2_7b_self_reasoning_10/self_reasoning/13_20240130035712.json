    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The phenylmethyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to its small size and limited ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius.",
