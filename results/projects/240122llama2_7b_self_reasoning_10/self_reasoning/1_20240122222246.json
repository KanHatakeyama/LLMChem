    "Reason": "2-pyridineacetamide has a melting point of 100.5\u00b0C. The pyridine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and planarity, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The acetamide group (-COCH3) can also contribute to the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
