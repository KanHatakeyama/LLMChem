    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of 10.5\u00b0C. The introduction of five chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per chlorine atom. The chlorine atoms also enhance the crystal lattice stability, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
