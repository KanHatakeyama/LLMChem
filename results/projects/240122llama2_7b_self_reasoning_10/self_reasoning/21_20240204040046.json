    "Reason": "9-bromofluorene has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is fluorene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -5 degrees Celsius due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The two phenyl groups contribute approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The bromine atom also introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
