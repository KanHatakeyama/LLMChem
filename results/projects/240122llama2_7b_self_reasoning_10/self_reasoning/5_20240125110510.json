    "Reason": "1,3-diamides have a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit, imidodicarbonimidic diamide, has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of two nitrogen atoms, which increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and rigidity. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
