    "Reason": "Proline is a cyclic amino acid with a melting point of 120-125 \u00b0C. The presence of the acetyl group (-COCH3) will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The 4-hydroxy group (-OH) will also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The trans configuration will also contribute to a higher melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and the presence of a polar functional group.",
