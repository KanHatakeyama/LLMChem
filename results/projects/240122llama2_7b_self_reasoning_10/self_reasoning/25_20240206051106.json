    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group introduces additional rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The succinimide group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
