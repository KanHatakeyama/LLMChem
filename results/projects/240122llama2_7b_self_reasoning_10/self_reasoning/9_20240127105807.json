    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a imidazole ring. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The imidazole ring also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The imidazole ring also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding.",
