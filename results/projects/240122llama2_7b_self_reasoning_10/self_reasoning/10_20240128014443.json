    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components: Two phenyl groups, which add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; four amino groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 each; and one ethanone unit, which introduces a carbonyl group, contributing approximately +20 due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions.",
