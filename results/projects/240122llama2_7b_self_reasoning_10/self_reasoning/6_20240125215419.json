    "Reason": "2-vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a vinyl group (\u2013CH=CH2) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The carboxylic acid group (\u2013COOH) introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, lowering the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The vinyl group also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group (\u2013CO\u2013) introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C.",
