    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a 4-bromophenyl group, which introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl sulfone group introduces a rigid structure and a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
