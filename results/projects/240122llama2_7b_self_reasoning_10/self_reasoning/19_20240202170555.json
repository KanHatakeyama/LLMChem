    "Reason": "1,3-Thiazole ring: The presence of a 1,3-thiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. Each phenyl group can contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C. The nitrogen within the thiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +30\u00b0C for each phenyl group.",
