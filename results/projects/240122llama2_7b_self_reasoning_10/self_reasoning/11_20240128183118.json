    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The introduction of the n-hexyl group (C6H13) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The hexyl group also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the n-hexyl group into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size and additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
