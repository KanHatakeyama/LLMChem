    "Reason": "2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid has a melting point of 120.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is salicylic acid, which has a melting point of -13.8 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group (-O-CH3) is a bulky group that can increase the melting point due to steric hindrance and the increased molecular volume. The hydroxyl group (-OH) can also contribute to the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and the increased molecular polarity. The presence of both groups can increase the melting point by approximately 20-30 degrees Celsius.",
