    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrafluorobenzene has a melting point of around -100 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The additional fluorine atom creates more rigidity in the structure, further contributing to the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
