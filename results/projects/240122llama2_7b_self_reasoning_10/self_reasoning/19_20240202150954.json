    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The furanyl group (C2(C)C) and the isopropyl group (C(C)C) add rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each. The carbonyl group (C=O) introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The nitro group (C1=O) raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group (C(C)C) adds a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group (C=O) introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The nitro group (C1=O) raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.
