    "Reason": "1-Chlorine substituents tend to lower the melting point compared to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
