    "Reason": "1,3-propanedithiol has a melting point of around -100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is ethanethiol, which has a melting point of -100 degrees Celsius. The presence of two sulfur atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
