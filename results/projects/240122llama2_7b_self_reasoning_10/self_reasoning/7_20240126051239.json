    "Reason": "2-dimethylaminoethyl groups can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity. Each dimethylamino group can be estimated to add approximately +20 to +30\u00b0C. Additionally, the ether linkage can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising it by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
