    "Reason": "2-Vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The vinyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C.
