    "Reason": "1,3-Diphenylpropane has a melting point of 100.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of a carboxamide group (-CO-NH2) generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The presence of a phenyl group in the structure also raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C.",
