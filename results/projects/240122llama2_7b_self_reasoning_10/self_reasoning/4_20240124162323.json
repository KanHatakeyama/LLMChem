    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its functional groups: (1) The basic unit is benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. (2) The two chlorine atoms increase the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius each. (3) The presence of two phenyl groups can contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius each.",
