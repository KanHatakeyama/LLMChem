    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces a new hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding. The exact impact of the methyl group depends on the specific compound and the molecular structure. In the case of isopropyl acetate, the methyl group is located on the carbonyl carbon, which can increase the molecular weight and rigidity, but also introduce new hydrogen bonding potential. The net effect should be a moderate increase in melting point due to the methyl group's impact on molecular weight and hydrogen bonding.",
