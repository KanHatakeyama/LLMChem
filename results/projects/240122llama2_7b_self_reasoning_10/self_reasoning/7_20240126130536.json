    "Reason": "1-phenylhydrazinecarboxamide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is hydrazine, which has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carboxamide group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of a phenyl group also introduces additional pi-pi interactions, which can contribute to an increase in the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
