    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-chloroaniline has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for our comparison is 1-chloro-2-propanol, which has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom also contributes to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The nitrogen atom can also participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
