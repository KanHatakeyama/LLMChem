    "Reason": "1,1-Bis(phenyl)ethane has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups significantly increases the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius.",
