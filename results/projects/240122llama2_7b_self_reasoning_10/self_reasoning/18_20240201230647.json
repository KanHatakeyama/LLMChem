    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be cyclohexane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings and a carboxylic acid group increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C each. Additionally, the cyclohexane ring formation introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
