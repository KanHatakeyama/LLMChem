    "Reason": "2-ethylhexylacetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the basic unit of ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional ethyl groups (\u2013CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of these additional groups also introduces more hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a raised melting point due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding.",
