    "Reason": "2-Methylaziridine has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The aziridine ring introduces a dipole moment, which increases intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
