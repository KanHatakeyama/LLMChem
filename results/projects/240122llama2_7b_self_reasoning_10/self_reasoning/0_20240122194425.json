    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzamide, which has a melting point of 120.2\u00b0C. The introduction of a benzene ring in place of a methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the carbonyl group in the amide functional group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also contribute to a higher melting point. However, the exact impact of these structural modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
