    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methylene-cyclobutane has a melting point that is lower than the base due to the lack of a rigid ring structure. The cyclobutane ring itself has a melting point around 10 degrees Celsius due to the presence of four phenyl groups. Each phenyl group can contribute approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
