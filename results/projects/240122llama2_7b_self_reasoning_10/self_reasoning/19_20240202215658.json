    "Reason": "1-phenyl-4-methylbenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1-methyl-4-phenylbenzene, which has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1-phenyl-4-methylbenzene will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
