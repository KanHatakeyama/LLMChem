    "Reason": "3-pentanol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The presence of three phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
