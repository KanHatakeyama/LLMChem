    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol will affect its melting point: (1) The phenyl group (c1cc(c(cc1Cl)Cl)CO) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius; (2) The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the crystal lattice stability, estimated at approximately -10 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
