    "Reason": "3-fluoro-4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The fluorine atom (F) increases the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and electronegativity. The methoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) introduces a hydrogen bond acceptor, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group (\u2013SO2N\u2013) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The sulfur atom also introduces a rigid structure, which can contribute to the melting point.",
