    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -97 degrees Celsius due to the presence of five fluorine atoms, which significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Phenetole has a melting point of -97 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius.",
