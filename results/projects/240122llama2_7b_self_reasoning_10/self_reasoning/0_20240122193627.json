    "Reason": "The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a sulfur atom and a sulfonamide group. These functional groups can increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and the formation of hydrogen bonds. The sulfur atom can also enhance the crystalline structure and increase the molecular weight, leading to a higher melting point.",
