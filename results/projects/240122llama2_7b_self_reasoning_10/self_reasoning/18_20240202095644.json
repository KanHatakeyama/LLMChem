    "Reason": "1,2-thiadiazole ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, adding about +20\u00b0C. The thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can sterically hinder the crystal lattice, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to the restricted mobility of the basic unit.",
