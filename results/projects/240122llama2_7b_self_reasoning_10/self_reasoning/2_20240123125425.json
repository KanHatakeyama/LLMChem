    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group (\u2013SO2\u2013) increases the melting point due to the presence of a polar functional group, which enhances intermolecular interactions and raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The acetamide group (\u2013NH2C(=O)\u2013) introduces a basic unit with a melting point of approximately +20\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitrogen atom and the carbonyl functional group. The azide group (\u2013N=N\u2013) also contributes to the melting point, with a value of approximately +10\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitrogen atom and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The sulfonamide group (\u2013SO2NH\u2013) can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which may further lower the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
