    "Reason": "1-(2-nitro),2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two nitro groups introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The dibenzoyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky structure and steric hindrance, reducing the melting point by approximately -20\u00b0C. The hydrazono group introduces a potential hydrogen bonding site, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
