    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. Two phenyl groups are present, which would significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the presence of two carbonyl groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl. The hydroxylamine group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by about +10\u00b0C.",
