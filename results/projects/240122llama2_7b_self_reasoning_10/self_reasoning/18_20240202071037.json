    "Reason": "2-fluoro-4-nitrobenzoic acid has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a fluorine atom, which increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Additionally, the nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. The nitro group also introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
