    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The iodine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.
