    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison is a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. 2. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. 3. The acetyl group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. 4. The alanyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. 5. The oxo group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius. 6. The tetracyclo[6.6.2.0~2,7~.0~9,14~]hexadeca-2,4,6,9,11,13,15-heptaene-15,16-dicarboxylate moiety adds approximately +20 due to the presence of two fused aromatic rings.",
