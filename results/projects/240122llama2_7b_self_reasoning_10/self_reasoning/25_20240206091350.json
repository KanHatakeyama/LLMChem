    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of butane, which is around -10\u00b0C. The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of a rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
