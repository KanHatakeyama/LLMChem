    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be methane, which has a melting point of -161.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a bromine atom increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the bromine atom also increases the electronegativity, which can lead to stronger intermolecular interactions and a higher melting point. The exact impact of the bromine atom is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. Ring formation: +30\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
