    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Additionally, the two nitro groups contribute to a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +50\u00b0C per group, totaling +100\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to a slight increase in molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +5 \u00b0C for each methoxy group.",
