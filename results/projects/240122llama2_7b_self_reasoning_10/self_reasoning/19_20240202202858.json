    "Reason": "2,6-dibromotoluene has a melting point that we can compare to toluene, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the toluene ring, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
