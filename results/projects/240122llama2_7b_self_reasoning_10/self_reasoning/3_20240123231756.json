    "Reason": "3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid has a melting point of 100\u00b0C due to the presence of two nitro groups, which increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C each. The methyl ester group can lower the melting point by approximately -5\u00b0C due to the reduction in molecular weight and the loss of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.",
