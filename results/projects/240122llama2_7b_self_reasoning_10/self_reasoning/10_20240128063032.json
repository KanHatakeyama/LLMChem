    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: The basic unit for this compound is indole, which has a melting point of around 95 degrees Celsius. The iodine atom introduces a significant increase due to the formation of iodine-containing compounds, which have a higher melting point than hydrogen-bonded compounds. The iodine atom can participate in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the iodine atom introduces a significant increase due to the formation of iodine-containing compounds, which have a higher melting point than hydrogen-bonded compounds. The iodine atom can participate in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
