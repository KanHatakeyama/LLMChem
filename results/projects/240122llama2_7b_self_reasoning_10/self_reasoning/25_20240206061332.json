    "Reason": "3,5-dichlorophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is phenol, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +10 \u00b0C.",
