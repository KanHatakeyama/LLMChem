    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of three hydroxyl groups in 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and molecular weight. Each hydroxyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the ethyl groups can contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The ethyl groups can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The cyano group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can contribute to the melting point. The cyano group can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
