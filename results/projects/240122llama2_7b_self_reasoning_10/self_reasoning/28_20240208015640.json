    "Reason": "9-methylanthracene has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is anthracene, which has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a bulky side chain, which can sterically hinder the anthracene ring, increasing the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group can also participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
