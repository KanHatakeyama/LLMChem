    "Reason": "1,3-propanedithiol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom in the thiol group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methyl group can contribute to the molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
