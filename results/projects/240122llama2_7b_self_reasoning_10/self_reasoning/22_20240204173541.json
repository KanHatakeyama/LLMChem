    "Reason": "4-n-hexyloxyphenol has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is 4-hexylphenol, which has a melting point of 50\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The hexyl group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The phenol group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
