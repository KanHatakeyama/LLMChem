    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanol, the base compound, has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. Naproanilide has a melting point increase due to the presence of a phenyl group, which can be estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring itself can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduction in molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding site.",
