    "Reason": "1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 5-chlorotetrazole, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group (Clc2nnnn2c1ccccc1) adds rigidity and molecular weight, increasing the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The tetrazole ring itself can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
