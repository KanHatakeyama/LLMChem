    "Reason": "The compound under consideration has several functional groups that can impact its melting point. The basic unit of analysis is benzamide, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The decyl group (C10) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The phenyl group (C6) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The methyl group (C1) adds approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight. The 4-methyl group (C1) adds approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight.",
