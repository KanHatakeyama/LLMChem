    "Reason": "3,5-dichlorophenol has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The presence of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +5\u00b0C. The phenol group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C. The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +5\u00b0C.",
