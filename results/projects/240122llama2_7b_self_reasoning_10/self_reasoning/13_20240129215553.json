    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in methyl isobutyrylacetate will affect its melting point: (1) The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (2) The isobutyryl group introduces a rigid structure, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (3) The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
