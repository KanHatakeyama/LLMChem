    "Reason": "2-Methylaziridine has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The aziridine ring introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius.",
