    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, due to the presence of two carbonyl groups, which can participate in dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The isouron structure introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C.",
