    "Reason": "4'-(methylthio)acetophenone has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The methylthio group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, raising the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C. The acetophenone group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at +30 \u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 \u00b0C.",
