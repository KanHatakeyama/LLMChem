    "Reason": "1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole has a melting point of 120\u00b0C. The chlorine atom increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and polarizability, which can lead to stronger intermolecular interactions. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its aromaticity, which can increase the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The tetrazole ring itself can also contribute to the melting point due to its planarity and increased molecular weight.",
