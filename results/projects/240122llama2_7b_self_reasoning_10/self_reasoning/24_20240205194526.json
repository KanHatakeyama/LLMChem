    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, estimated at +30\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The dioxane-like bridging moiety introduces rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C.",
