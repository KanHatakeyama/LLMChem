    "Reason": "5-bromoindole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is indole, which has a melting point of -10.5 \u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C.",
