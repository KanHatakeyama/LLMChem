    "Reason": "1,2-Naphthoquinone has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C. Naproanilide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the structural modifications relative to the base unit. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,2-naphthoquinone, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications in naproanilide include two phenyl groups, which can increase the melting point due to pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +30\u00b0C each. Additionally, naproanilide has a benzene ring, which can contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. Finally, the nitro group can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
