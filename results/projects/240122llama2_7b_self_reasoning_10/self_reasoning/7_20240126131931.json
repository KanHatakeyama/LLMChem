    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a bulky and electronegative group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact.",
