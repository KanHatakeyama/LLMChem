    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of n-butane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is 1-methyl-2-propanol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each bromine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
