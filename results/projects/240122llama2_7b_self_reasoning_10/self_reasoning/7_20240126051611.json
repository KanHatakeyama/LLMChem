    "Reason": "2-fluorobenzotrifluoride has a melting point of -109.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 3 fluorines) = 45 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius each, for a total increase of +40 degrees Celsius.",
