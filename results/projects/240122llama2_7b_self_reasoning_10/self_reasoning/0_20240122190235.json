    "Reason": "4'-Methylthioacetophenone is a compound with a phenolic hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group, and a methylthio group. The phenolic hydroxyl group is a strong hydrogen bond donor, which can increase the melting point. The carbonyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also increase the melting point. The methylthio group is a polar group that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point. The presence of the methylthio group can also increase the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which can also increase the melting point.",
