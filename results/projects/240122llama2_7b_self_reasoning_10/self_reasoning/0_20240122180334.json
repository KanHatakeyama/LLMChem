    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound can be considered as aniline (with a melting point of -35.5 degrees Celsius) since the benzene ring and the methyl groups are similar to those in aniline. The tetramethyl group adds additional rigidity and steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point. However, the exact impact of the tetramethyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
