    "Reason": "2-Ethyloxirane has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group (C2H5) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The oxirane ring (C=O) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
