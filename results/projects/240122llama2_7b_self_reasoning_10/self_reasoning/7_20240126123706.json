    "Reason": "1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered ethylene (with a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C) because the tetrachloro group introduces four chlorine atoms, which significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each chlorine is estimated to add approximately +50\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
