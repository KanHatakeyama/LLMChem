    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functional groups are known to increase the melting point of a molecule. The 3,3,3-trifluoro-2-propanamide base has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C, which is a reasonable estimate based on the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969. The 3-chlorophenyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The trifluoromethyl group can also increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and steric hindrance.",
