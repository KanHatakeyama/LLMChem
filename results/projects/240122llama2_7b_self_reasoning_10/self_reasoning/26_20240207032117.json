    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be acetone, which has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a 2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl group. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity, contributing around +5 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, raising the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius.",
