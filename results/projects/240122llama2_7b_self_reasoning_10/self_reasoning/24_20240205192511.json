    "Reason": "3-chlorophenyl group: The 3-chlorophenyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure, which might raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C.",
