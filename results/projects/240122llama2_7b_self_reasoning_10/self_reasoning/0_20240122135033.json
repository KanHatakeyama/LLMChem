    "Reason": "2-Amino-1,4-naphthalenedione has a melting point of 140\u00b0C. The pyridine ring in the molecule contributes to the melting point, as it is a rigid and planar structure that can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, which increases the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group attached to the pyridine ring also adds a small contribution to the melting point, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring itself has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C, which is relatively rigid and planar, and the carbonyl group adds a small contribution to the melting point, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
