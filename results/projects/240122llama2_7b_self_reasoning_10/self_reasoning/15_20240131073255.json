    "Reason": "2,4-dibromobenzene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The bromine atoms introduce significant withdrawing groups, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C each. The presence of two fused aromatic rings also raises the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring.",
