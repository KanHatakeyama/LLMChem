    "Reason": "1,1-Dimethoxyethane (methyl ethyl ether) has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The ethyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding.
