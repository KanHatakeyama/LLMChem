    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The anthracene base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a planar, aromatic system with a high melting point. The nitro group's effect might be around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
