    "Reason": "3-methyl-butyraldehyde oxime has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The oxime group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The aldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
