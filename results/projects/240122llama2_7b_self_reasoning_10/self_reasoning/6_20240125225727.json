    "Reason": "1,3-Benzothiazole has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to its rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential. The presence of two phenyl groups in the base structure can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C each, totaling +40\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The ethanenitrile group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: 100\u00b0C (base), +40\u00b0C (two phenyl groups), +50\u00b0C (chlorine), and +20\u00b0C (hydrazono and ethanenitrile).",
