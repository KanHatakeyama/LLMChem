    "Reason": "1,3-Butanediamide has a basic melting point of around -10\u00b0C due to the presence of a rigid, symmetrical structure with a melting point-raising nitrogen atom. The two methyl groups can contribute to the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C each, totaling +40\u00b0C. The carbonyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. However, the exact impact of these functional groups on the melting point can be difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
