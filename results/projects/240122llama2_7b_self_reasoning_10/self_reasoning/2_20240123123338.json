    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point of 100.5\u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant increase in melting point due to its high electronegativity and ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions with neighboring molecules, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The indole ring itself has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C, and the additional iodine atom can enhance this value by approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
