    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be methane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl and ethyl groups contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius each.",
