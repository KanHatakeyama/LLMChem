    "Reason": "1-propene, 1-chloro-, (z)- has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1-propene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the propene chain, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The (z)-configuration also contributes to a more rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
