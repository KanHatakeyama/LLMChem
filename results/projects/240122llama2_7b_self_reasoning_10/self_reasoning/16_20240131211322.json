    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 30 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups and a methoxy group in benzyl sulfide increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups also increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each.",
