    "Reason": "4,4-Bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two methyl groups can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each methyl group may contribute around +10 to +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the two phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups can also form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl.",
