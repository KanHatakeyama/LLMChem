    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The functional groups in the molecule that influence the melting point are the nitro group, the biguanide group, and the phenyl group. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The biguanide group is a polar functional group that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also contribute to an increase in melting point. The phenyl group is a large, planar, and unsaturated functional group that can enhance molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, both of which contribute to an increase in melting point.",
