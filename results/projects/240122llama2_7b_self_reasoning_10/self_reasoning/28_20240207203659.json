    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde will affect its melting point: (1) Two methoxy groups, which can each add approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The iodine atom can participate in hydrogen bonding, adding about +5 due to the presence of a hydrogen bonding potential.",
