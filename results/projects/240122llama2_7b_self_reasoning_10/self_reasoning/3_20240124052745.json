    "Reason": "2-fluoro-4-nitrobenzoic acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of around 120\u00b0C. (2) The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. (3) The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. (4) The fluorine atom also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
