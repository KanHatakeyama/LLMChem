    "Reason": "1,6-hexanediol, the base unit for comparison, has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a hexyl group (C6H13) in place of a methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The hexyl group also introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, contributing approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at +30 degrees Celsius.",
