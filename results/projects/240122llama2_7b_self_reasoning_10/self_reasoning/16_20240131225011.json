    "Reason": "2-Aminopropane has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the amino group (NH2) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the amino group also introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
