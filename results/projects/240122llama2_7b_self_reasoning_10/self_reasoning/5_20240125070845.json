    "Reason": "1,1'-Nitrophenyl acetate has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The introduction of the nitro group (\u2013NO2) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds. The nitro group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the acetate group (\u2013CO2H) can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
