    "Reason": "1-aspartic acid has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of a benzyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The aspartic acid group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and create a more rigid structure. The benzyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The aspartic acid group can also add approximately +10 due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and create a more rigid structure.",
