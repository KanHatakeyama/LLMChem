    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The methyl groups increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each methyl group may add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
