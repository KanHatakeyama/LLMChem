    "Reason": "2,2-dibenzyl-3-oxobutanoate has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The dioxo-function introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C.",
