    "Reason": "1-methyl substitution generally lowers the melting point compared to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure but reduces the crystal lattice stability, which might lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C.",
