    "Reason": "1-Aspartic acid base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The benzene ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methoxy group can also increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at about +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
