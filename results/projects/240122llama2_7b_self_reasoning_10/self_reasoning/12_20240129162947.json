    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is stilbene, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The nitro group also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
