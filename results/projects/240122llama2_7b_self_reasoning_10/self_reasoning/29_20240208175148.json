    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be the fluorinated ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a bromine atom increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. However, the fluorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The bromine atom can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
