    "Reason": "1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group, a chlorine atom, and a tetrazole ring. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The tetrazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at +20 \u00b0C.",
