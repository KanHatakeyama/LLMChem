    "Reason": "1-pyrrolidinyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)phenol will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The pyrrolidinyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
