    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the octyl group (C1CCCCCC1) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The amine group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay between these two factors. The octyl group introduces rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The amine group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around -10 degrees Celsius.",
