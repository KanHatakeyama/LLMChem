    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities significantly increase the melting point due to adding more rigid structures and making the molecule more compact. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms add approximately +10\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The phenyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The presence of these functionalities raises the melting point.",
