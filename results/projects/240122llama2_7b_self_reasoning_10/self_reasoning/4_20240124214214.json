    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the chlorine atoms also increase the electronegativity, which can lead to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The net effect should be a higher melting point due to both molecular size and increased electronegativity.",
