    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of a benzyl group can increase the melting point due to the rigidity and steric hindrance it introduces. The benzamide group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the crystalline structure's rigidity.",
