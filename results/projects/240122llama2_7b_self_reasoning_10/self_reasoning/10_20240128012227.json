    "Reason": "1,3-propanedione has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in (~2~H_3_)Methyl 2-(~2~H_3_)methyl(~2~H_2_)prop-2-enoate will affect its melting point: (1) The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point by approximately +10 due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces; (2) The two phenyl groups add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (3) The carbonyl group introduces a dipole moment, raising the melting point by approximately +10; (4) The propane chain introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point by approximately +20 due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
