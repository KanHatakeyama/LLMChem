    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanol, the base for comparison, has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion significantly augment the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
