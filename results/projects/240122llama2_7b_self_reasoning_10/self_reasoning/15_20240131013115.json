    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The presence of three carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. However, the hydroxyl group's effect might be counteracted by the ethyl group's reduction of crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. Summing up these changes: Cyanuric acid base (+100\u00b0C), three carbonyl groups (+30\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C).",
