    "Reason": "1,1'-Thiabenzene base, with a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C, is a good starting point for comparison. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly augment the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the thiabenzene base itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
