    "Reason": "1,3-Butanediol has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a tert-butyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the tert-butyl group also introduces a rigid structure which can enhance pi-stacking interactions and overall molecular rigidity. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to both molecular size and rigidity.",
