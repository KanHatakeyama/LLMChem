    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group, a phenyl group, and a carbamate group. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The phenyl group, when connected to a benzene ring, tends to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 4-phenylbenzoate, we have one additional phenyl group linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point.",
