    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and the reduced capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately -5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C.",
