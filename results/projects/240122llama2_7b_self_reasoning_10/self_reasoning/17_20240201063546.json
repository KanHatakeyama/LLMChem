    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The phenoxy group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point by approximately -2 degrees Celsius due to decreased hydrogen bonding potential.",
