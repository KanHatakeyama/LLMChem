    "Reason": "1,3-Isouron, a compound with a melting point to be predicted, contains functional groups that contribute to its melting point: (1) The basic unit, 1,3-propanediol, has a melting point of approximately 50 degrees Celsius. (2) The methoxy group (O-CH3) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. (3) The carbamate group (N-C(=O)O) raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. (4) The isouron group (O=C(Nc1cc(on1)C(C)(C)C)N(C)C) introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +30 degrees Celsius.",
