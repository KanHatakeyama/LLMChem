    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a phenyl group (\u2013C(=O)C=CC2=O) increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the oxygen within the methoxy group also increases hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in propane, the additional oxygen atom allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methoxy group into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
