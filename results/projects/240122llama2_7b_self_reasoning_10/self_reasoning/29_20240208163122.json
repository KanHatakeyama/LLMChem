    "Reason": "1,1'-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the bromine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
