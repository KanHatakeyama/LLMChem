    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The cyclohexene group itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight. Each cyclohexene ring introduces approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The carboxylic acid and anhydride functionalities introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C each. The presence of two carbonyl groups also increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
