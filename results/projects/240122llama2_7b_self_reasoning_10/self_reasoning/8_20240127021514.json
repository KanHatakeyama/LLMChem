    "Reason": "2,4-dibromobenzene has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each bromine atom. The presence of two fused aromatic rings also raises the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring.",
