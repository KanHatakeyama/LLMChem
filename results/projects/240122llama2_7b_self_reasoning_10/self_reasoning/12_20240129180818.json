    "Reason": "1,1'-Dimethylacetamide has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is acetamide, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the methyl groups also increase the hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay between these two factors. The methyl groups can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and size. However, the additional hydrogen bonding potential can lower the melting point by approximately -5 degrees Celsius.",
