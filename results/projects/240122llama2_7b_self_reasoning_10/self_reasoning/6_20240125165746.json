    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. Diphenyl terephthalate has a melting point that is significantly higher due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance pi-pi interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the terephthalate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The net effect should thus be a significant increase due to the combination of additional pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and hydrogen bonding.",
