    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is an aniline, which has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of a naphthalene ring in the structure of naproanilide increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Naphthalene is a larger and more rigid molecule than benzene, which would enhance the crystalline structure and increase the melting point. We can estimate the contribution of the naphthalene ring to be around +100\u00b0C to +150\u00b0C, depending on the exact structure and the degree of planarity.",
