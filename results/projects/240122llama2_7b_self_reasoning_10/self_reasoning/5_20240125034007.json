    "Reason": "9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group introduces a rigid structure with a melting point-raising effect. The fluorenyl group itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and molecular weight. Each fluorenyl group may add approximately +20 to +30 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methoxy group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a raised melting point due to the rigid structure and hydrogen bonding but with a more significant increase due to the fluorenyl group.",
