    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be imidazole, which has a melting point of -15.5 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a phenyl group linked in a linear fashion. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the imidazole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding.",
