    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is the piperazine ring, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly enhances the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the cortexolone structure possesses a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius for this structural feature.",
