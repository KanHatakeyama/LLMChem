    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered a chloromethyl-substituted benzene, which has a melting point increase due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The chloromethyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
