    "Reason": "1,1'-Xanthene has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in xanthene will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C; (3) The xanthene ring itself adds roughly +20 due to the presence of two fused aromatic rings, which increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight.",
