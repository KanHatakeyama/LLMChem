    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of n-butane, which is around -10\u00b0C. The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
