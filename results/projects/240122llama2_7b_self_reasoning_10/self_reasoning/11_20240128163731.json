    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point that we can compare to pyridine, which has a melting point of 5.0 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the pyridine ring, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius for each chlorine atom. The pyridine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the pyridine ring, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius for each chlorine atom.",
