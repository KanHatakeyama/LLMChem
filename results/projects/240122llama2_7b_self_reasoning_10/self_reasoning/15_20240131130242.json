    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point of 30 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the methyl groups also increase the crystal lattice stability, which can lower the melting point. The net effect is a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
