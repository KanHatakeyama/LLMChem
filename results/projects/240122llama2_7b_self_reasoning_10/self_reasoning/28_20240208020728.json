    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The introduction of the 4-chlorophenyl group increases the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The pyrazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
