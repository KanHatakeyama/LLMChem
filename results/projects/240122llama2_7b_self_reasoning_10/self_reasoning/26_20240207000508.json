    "Reason": "1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 5-chlorotetrazole, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The tetrazole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
