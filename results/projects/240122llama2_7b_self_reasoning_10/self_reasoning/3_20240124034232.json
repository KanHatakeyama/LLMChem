    "Reason": "1-propanamine has a melting point of around -100\u00b0C. The isopropyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The exact impact depends on the size and shape of the side chain, but a rough estimate for a bulky group like isopropyl is around +20\u00b0C.",
