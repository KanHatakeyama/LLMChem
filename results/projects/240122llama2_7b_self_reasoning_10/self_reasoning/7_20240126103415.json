    "Reason": "2,6-Di-tert-butylpyridine has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two tert-butyl groups increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The pyridine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
