    "Reason": "1,1'-Spiroperone has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison is benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group, a nitro group, and a carbonyl group. The methoxy group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The spiro structure introduces additional rigidity, which can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The presence of two fused aromatic rings also increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
