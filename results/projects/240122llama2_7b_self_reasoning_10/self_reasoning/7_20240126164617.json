    "Reason": "1-chlorooctane has a melting point that is influenced by its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is octane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
