    "Reason": "1,1-Undecan is a saturated hydrocarbon with a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be a straight-chain hydrocarbon with 11 carbon atoms, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1,1-undecan will affect its melting point: (1) The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. (2) The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can raise the melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The methyl group can contribute around +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
