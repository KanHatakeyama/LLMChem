    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius.",
