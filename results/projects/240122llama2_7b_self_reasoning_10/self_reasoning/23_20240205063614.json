    "Reason": "1,3-propanedithiol has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered ethanethiol (with a melting point of -106.0\u00b0C) because the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and a more asymmetric structure, which would notably increase the melting point. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and a more asymmetric structure, which would notably increase the melting point.",
