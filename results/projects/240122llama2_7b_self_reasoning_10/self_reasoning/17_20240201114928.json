    "Reason": "1,3,4-Thiadiazole ring: The presence of a 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The Incasan base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C.",
