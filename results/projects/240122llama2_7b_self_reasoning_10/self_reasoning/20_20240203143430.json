    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Additionally, the naphthalene ring formation introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight.",
