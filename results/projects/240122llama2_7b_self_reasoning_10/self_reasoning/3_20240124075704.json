    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-imidazolidine has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethane, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of three butyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the phosphate group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The imidazolidine ring also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
