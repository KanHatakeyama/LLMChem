    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group and a hydroquinone ring. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The hydroquinone ring also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
