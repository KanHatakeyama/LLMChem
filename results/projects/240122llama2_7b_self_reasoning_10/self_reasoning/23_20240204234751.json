    "Reason": "1,2-furanyl groups, when connected to a dioxime ring, significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each furanyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The dioxime ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
