    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The anthracene base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a planar, aromatic system with a high melting point. The nitro group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one nitro group, we have +50\u00b0C total (with less influence due to the complex structure), and one anthracene base at +100\u00b0C (with more influence due to the planar, aromatic system and hydrogen bonding potential).",
