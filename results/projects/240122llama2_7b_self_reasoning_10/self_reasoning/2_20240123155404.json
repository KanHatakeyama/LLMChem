    "Reason": "The basic unit for our comparison will be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group, a propyl group, and a sulfur atom. Each of these functional groups will contribute to the melting point in different ways: (1) The methyl group (\u2013CH3) adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity; (2) The propyl group (\u2013CH2CH2\u2013) adds roughly +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity; (3) The sulfur atom (S) can add approximately +20\u00b0C due to the presence of a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point.",
