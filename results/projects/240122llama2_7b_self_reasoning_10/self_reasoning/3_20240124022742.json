    "Reason": "1-methylbenzyl alcohol has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is benzyl alcohol, which has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional group in p-methyl benzyl alcohol will affect its melting point: (1) The methyl group adds approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The benzyl group (Cc1ccc(CO)cc1) adds roughly +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
