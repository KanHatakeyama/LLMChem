    "Reason": "1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-Octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 1,4-diiodobutane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The iodine atom also increases the melting point due to the presence of a dipole moment, which raises the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The fluorine substituents also increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
