    "Reason": "3,3,3-Trifluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit we can compare to is N-methylacetamide which has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
