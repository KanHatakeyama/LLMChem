    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional rigid structures and pi-system. The naphthalene ring itself can contribute around +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity. The methylene bridge can lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduced symmetry.",
