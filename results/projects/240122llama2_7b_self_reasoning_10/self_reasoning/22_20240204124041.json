    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methyl groups reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -10 degrees Celsius. The trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The propan-1-imine base introduces a basic nitrogen, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.
