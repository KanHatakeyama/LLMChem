    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the nitrogen within the piperidine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C.",
