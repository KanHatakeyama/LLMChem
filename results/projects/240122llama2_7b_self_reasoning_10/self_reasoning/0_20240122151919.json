    "Reason": "2-ethylhexylacetate is a compound with a simple structure, and its melting point can be predicted based on the melting point of its constituent parts. The basic unit we can compare to is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.15 \u00b0C. The additional functional groups in 2-ethylhexylacetate will affect its melting point: (1) The ethyl group (-CH2-CH2-), which adds approximately +20 \u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The hexyl group (-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-), which adds roughly +30 \u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a bulky side chain.",
