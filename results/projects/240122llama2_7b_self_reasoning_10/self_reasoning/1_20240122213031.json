    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two ethyl groups and one methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and a higher melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a methyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The ethyl groups increase the molecular weight and size, which also raises the melting point. However, the presence of two ethyl groups can also reduce the melting point due to the increased van der Waals interactions between the ethyl groups. The net effect is a complex interplay of factors, but the methyl group is expected to have a greater impact due to its rigid structure and increased molecular weight.",
