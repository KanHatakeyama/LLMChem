    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-imidazolidine has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is 1,3,5-trimethyl-2-imidazolidine, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in tri-n-butyl phosphate will affect its melting point: (1) The three methyl groups add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The phosphate group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, adding about +10. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
