    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the lauramide structure introduces a rigid hydrocarbon chain, which can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +5\u00b0C per group, totaling +10\u00b0C.",
