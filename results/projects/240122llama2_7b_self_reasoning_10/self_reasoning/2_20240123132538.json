    "Reason": "1,3-Diphenylpropane-1,3-dione has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, propane, has a melting point of -18.7 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each phenyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (20 degrees Celsius x 2 phenyl groups) = 40 degrees Celsius.",
