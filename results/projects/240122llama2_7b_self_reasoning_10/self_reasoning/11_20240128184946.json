    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-nitrobenzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of three methyl groups and a nitro group increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of polar functional groups. The methyl groups add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30.",
