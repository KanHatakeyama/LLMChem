    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for this compound can be considered as a pentane chain, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The introduction of a fluorine atom (F) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. Fluorine substituents tend to increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The fluorine atom can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure.",
