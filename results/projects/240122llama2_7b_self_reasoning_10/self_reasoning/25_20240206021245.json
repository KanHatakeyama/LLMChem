    "Reason": "1,3-Diphenylpropane has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly enhances the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The methyl group (Cc2noc1ccccc12) adds a small increase due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at about +5 to +10 degrees Celsius.",
