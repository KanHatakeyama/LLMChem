    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in (2,2-dibromoethenyl)benzene will affect its melting point: (1) The two phenyl groups can add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The bromine atoms can increase the melting point by approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of a more rigid structure.",
