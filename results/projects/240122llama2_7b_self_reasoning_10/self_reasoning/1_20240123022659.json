    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene has a melting point of -10.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a tert-butyl group increases the molecular weight and introduces a bulky, rigid structure, which can contribute to a higher melting point. The tert-butyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
