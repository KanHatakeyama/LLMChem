    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can significantly impact the melting point. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The acetonitrile group introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C each.",
