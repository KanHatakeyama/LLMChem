    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenyl can increase the melting point due to the additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The ethyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group can also participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
