    "Reason": "4,4-Bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the dimethylamino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The ketone group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
