    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The thiol group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
