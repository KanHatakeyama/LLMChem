    "Reason": "2-Methylcyclopentanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentane, which has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
