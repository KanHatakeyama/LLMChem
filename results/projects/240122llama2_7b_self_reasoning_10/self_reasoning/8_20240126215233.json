    "Reason": "2,5-dichlorothiophene has a melting point that we can compare to 1,3-dichloropropene, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be 1,3-dichloropropene. The chlorine atom introduces a significant increase due to the strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
