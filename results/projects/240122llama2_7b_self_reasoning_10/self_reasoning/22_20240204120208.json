    "Reason": "3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-(trifluoromethyl)propionic acid has a melting point that is influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their increased molecular weight and the rigidity they bring, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each. The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group also introduces a rigid structure, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
