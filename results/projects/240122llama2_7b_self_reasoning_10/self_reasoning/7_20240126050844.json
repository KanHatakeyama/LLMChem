    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is piperazine, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an ethyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) generally lowers the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Piperazine has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius.",
