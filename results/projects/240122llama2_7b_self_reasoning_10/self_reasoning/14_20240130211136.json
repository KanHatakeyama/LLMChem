    "Reason": "4-n-hexyloxyphenol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a hexyl group and an oxo group. The hexyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The oxo group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
