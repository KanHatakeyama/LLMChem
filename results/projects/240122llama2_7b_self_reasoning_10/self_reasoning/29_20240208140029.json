    "Reason": "6-methylpyridine-2-carboxaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of 10.5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The carboxaldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can form hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C.",
