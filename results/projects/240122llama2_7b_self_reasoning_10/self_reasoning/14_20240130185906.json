    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for this compound is toluene, which has a melting point of 35.5 \u00b0C. The nitro functional group (\u2013NO2) can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The presence of three nitro groups (\u2013NO2) can significantly increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +30 \u00b0C each.",
