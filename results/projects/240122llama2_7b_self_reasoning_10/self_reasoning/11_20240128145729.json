    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The aniline ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The chlorine and fluorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the presence of polar functional groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure.",
