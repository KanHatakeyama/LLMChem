    "Reason": "3-pentanol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
