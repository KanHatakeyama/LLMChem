    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point that can be analyzed by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups (C1CCCC1) increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the ethyl group (C1CCCC1) introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, which may contribute to the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The butyl group (C1CCCC1) also adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CCCC)) introduces a strong dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point.
