    "Reason": "2-vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which melts at 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the vinyl group, which introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The carboxy group introduces a hydroxyl group, which raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to its small size and limited ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at -5\u00b0C.",
