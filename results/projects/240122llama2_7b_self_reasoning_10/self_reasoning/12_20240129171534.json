    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of two chloromethyl groups (\u2013CH2Cl) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10 \u00b0C for each chloromethyl group. The chlorine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
