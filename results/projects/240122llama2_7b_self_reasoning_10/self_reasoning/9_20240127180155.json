    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius each. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
