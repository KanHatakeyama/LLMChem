    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with two fused aromatic rings, which increases the melting point due to pi-stacking interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +25 \u00b0C for this structural modification. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10 \u00b0C. The ether linkage introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 \u00b0C per group, totaling +40 \u00b0C.",
