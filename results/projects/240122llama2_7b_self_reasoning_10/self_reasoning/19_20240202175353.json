    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that we can compare to 2-nitrophenol, which has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 5-morpholinyl-2-nitrophenol will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The morpholinyl group (5-morpholinyl) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +10; (3) The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
