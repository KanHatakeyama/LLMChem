    "Reason": "1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy-, tri has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of three phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of three methoxy groups can contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +6\u00b0C per group, totaling +18\u00b0C.",
