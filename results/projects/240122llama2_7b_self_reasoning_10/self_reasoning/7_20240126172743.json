    "Reason": "3-(boc-amino)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxyphenyl group, which can increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Additionally, the amino group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also contribute to the melting point. The methoxy group can also increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at about +5 to +10\u00b0C.
