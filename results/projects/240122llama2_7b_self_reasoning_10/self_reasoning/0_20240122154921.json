    "Reason": "3-chloropropionitrile has a melting point of -71.5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom in the molecule increases the electronegativity of the molecule, which leads to stronger intermolecular interactions. The nitrile group (-CN) also increases the molecular polarity, which can enhance the intermolecular interactions. The combination of increased electronegativity and polarity can lead to a higher melting point.",
