    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C. The bromine atom increases the melting point due to its electronegativity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The pyridine ring itself has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C.",
