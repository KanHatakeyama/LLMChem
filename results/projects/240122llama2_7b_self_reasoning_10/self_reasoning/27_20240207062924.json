    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethylbenzene, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups (\u2013CH3) in place of two hydrogen atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The methyl group also introduces a more rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point. The net effect is a raised melting point due to the combination of molecular size, hydrogen bonding, and dipole interactions.",
