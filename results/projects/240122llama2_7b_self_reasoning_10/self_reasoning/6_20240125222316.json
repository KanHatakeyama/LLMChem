    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonisomer: The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a chlorine atom, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atom can also participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. Additionally, the mercaptan group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C.",
