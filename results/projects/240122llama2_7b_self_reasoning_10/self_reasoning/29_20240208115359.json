    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the hydroquinone moiety introduces two phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
