    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups and a methoxy group can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of hydroxyl and methoxy groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the crystal lattice stability. The phenyl groups can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of pi-pi interactions. The methoxy group can add approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of hydroxyl groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The presence of two carbonyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at +20 each, due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions.",
