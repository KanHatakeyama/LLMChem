    "Reason": "1-chlorine substitutions tend to increase the melting point compared to phenol, as the chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, further contributing to the melting point. The exact impact of the chlorine atom is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
