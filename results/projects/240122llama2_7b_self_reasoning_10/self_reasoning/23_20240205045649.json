    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the piperazine ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C.",
