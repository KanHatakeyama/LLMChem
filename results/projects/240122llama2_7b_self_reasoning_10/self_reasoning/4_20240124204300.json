    "Reason": "1,3-diamides have a melting point that can be estimated by considering their structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a phenyl group in the imidodicarbonimidic diamide structure increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +30 to +50 \u00b0C. Additionally, the chlorine atom introduces a significant increase due to the formation of hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The diamide linkage itself can also contribute to the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C.",
