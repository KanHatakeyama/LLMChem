    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane is a compound with a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom. The fluorine atom increases the melting point of the compound due to its high electronegativity and the resulting strong intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The melting point of 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane is estimated to be around -100 degrees Celsius.",
