    "Reason": "1-methylcyclohexane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be cyclohexane, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom reduces the molecular weight and size, which generally lowers the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
