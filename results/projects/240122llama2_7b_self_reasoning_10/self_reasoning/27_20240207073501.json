    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. Voriconazole has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit we can compare to is the fluorinated ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in Voriconazole will affect its melting point: (1) The two phenyl groups can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (3) The fluorinated ethane group (F) can add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
