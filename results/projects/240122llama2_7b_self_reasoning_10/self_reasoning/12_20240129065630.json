    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a phenyl group, which increases the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
