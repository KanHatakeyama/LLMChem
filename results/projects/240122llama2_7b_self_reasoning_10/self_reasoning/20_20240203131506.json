    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The stilbene ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10 \u00b0C.",
