    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups and a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The chlorine atom also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
