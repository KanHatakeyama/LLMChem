    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic imidazole ring has a melting point around 10 degrees Celsius due to its rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding. (2) Two phenyl groups are present, which significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
