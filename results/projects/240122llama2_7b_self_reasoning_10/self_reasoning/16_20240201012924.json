    "Reason": "1,3-propanedithiol has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in methyl_ethyl_sulfide will affect its melting point: (1) The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. (2) The ethyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
