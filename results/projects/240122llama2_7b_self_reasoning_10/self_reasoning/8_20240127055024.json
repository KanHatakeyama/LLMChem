    "Reason": "1,2,6-Tetramethylbenzenamine has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be ethylene diamine, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of four methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the nitrogen within the amine group introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each.",
