    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a melting point that we can compare to pyrrole, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The pyrrole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and rigidity, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to its small size and limited ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately -5 degrees Celsius.",
