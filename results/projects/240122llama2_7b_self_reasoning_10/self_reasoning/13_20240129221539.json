    "Reason": "1,1'-Phthalide base has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. Two phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of diphenyl terephthalate, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the terephthalate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
