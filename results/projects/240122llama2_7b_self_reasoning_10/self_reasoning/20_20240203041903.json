    "Reason": "2-Methyl-2H-benzotriazole has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 2-methyl-2H-benzotriazole has a more rigid structure with a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), one methyl group (-10\u00b0C), and one chlorine atom (+50\u00b0C).",
