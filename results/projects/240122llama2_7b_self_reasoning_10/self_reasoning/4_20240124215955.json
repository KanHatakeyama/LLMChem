    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)acrylic acid has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular interactions. Each trifluoromethyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity. Additionally, the carbonyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may contribute to a slight increase in the melting point.",
