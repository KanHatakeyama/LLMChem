    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups and a methoxy group can increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. Additionally, the sulfonyl group can increase the melting point due to its ability to participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The azide group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
