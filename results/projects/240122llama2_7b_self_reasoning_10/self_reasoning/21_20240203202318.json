    "Reason": "2-chloroethyl sulfide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of ethyl vinyl ether, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is ethyl vinyl ether, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The 2-chloro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
