    "Reason": "2-bromo-2'-methoxyacetophenone has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be acetophenone, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The bromine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar interactions, estimated at +30 \u00b0C. The methoxy group also introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5 \u00b0C.",
