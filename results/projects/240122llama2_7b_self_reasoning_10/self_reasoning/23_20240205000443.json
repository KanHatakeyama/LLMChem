    "Reason": "1,1'-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The compound hesperetine has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, hesperetine has a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius for this structural feature.",
