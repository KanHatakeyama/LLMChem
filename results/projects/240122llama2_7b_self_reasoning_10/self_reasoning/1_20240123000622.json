    "Reason": "1,4-benzodiazepine has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group (NO2) generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and electronegativity, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The fused aromatic rings in the base structure also contribute to the melting point, estimated at +25 degrees Celsius for each additional fused ring. The methoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) can increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The chlorine atom (Cl) can also contribute to the melting point due to its electronegativity and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius.",
