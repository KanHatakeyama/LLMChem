    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of one additional fluorine atom, which increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure.",
