    "Reason": "4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene has a melting point of around -100 degrees Celsius. The ethyl and methyl groups increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of these groups also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a decreased melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding.",
