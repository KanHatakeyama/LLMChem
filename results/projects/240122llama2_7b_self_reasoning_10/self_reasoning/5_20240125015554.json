    "Reason": "2-methylcyclopentanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The ketone group (\u2013CO\u2013) can contribute around +20 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and form a more rigid structure.",
