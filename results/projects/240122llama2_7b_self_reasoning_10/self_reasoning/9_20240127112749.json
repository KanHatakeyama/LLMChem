    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a phenyl group, which increases the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point, but to a lesser extent. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
