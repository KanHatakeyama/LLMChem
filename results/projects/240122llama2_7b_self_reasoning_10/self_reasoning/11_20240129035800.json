    "Reason": "2,5-Bis(1-naphthyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole has a melting point that we can compare to naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings and a dioxane-like bridging moiety increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each additional phenyl group can add approximately +100 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The dioxane-like bridging moiety adds rigidity and likely contributes more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
