    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C. The alcohol group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C.",
