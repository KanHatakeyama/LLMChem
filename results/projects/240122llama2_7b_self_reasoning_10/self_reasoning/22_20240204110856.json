    "Reason": "4-Morpholinylmethyl functionalities introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of four additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 4-(4-morpholinylmethyl)benzoic acid, we have four additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
