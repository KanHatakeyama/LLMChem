    "Reason": "4-Phenylbenzoate has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The methyl group (-CH3) is a relatively small addition to the molecule and will not significantly affect the melting point. The phenyl group, on the other hand, is a larger and more polar functional group, which will increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding. The addition of the methyl group will also increase the molecular weight, which may slightly lower the melting point.",
