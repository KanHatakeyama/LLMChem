    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a fused aromatic ring system.",
