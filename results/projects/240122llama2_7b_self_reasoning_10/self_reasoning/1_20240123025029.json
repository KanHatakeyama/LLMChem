    "Reason": "1,2-Dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, the base compound, has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The functional groups in dromostanolone contribute to the melting point as follows: (1) The methyl groups (\u2013CH3) add approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; (2) The 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline ring system contributes +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity; (3) The phenyl group (C6H5) adds +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; (4) The methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) adds +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential.",
