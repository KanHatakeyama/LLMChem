    "Reason": "4-Nhac-2266-tetrame-piperidin-n-oxide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that can impact its melting point. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we need to consider the following structural components:\n- Piperidine ring: The piperidine ring is a rigid structure with a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to its planarity and molecular weight.\n- Nitro functional group: The nitro functional group can increase the melting point by around +5\u00b0C due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and enhance molecular rigidity.\n- Carbonyl group: The carbonyl group can form hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20\u00b0C.\n- Methoxy groups: The two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by around +5\u00b0C each due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight.\n- Tetramethylene chain: The tetramethylene chain can contribute around +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight.\n- Piperidine ring: The piperidine ring is a rigid structure with a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to its planarity and molecular weight.",
