    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. Tebuconazole has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit of analysis is the 1,2-propanediol moiety, which on its own exhibits intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thus increasing the melting point. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group increases the molecular weight and volume, which might minutely raise the melting point. The ether linkage reduces the melting point by approximately -2 degrees Celsius due to decreased hydrogen bonding. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The tebuconazole molecule also contains a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius for this structural feature. Additionally, tebuconazole has two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 degrees Celsius for each additional fused ring.",
