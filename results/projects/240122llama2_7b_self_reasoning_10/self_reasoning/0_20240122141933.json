    "Reason": "Furaneol is a sesquiterpene, which means it has a complex molecular structure with multiple functional groups that can affect its melting point. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. Furaneol has two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The molecular structure also includes a methyl group, which can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Additionally, furaneol possesses a ketone group, which can contribute to the melting point through increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. Finally, the molecule has a methylene bridge, which can add rigidity and contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
