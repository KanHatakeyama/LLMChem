    "Reason": "The basic unit, acetylene, has a melting point of -12.6 degrees Celsius. Trimethylsilylation of the carbon atoms increases the melting point due to the steric hindrance caused by the bulky silyl groups. Each silyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 2 silyl groups) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
