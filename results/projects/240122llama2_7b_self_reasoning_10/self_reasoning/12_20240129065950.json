    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl, the basic unit for comparison, has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The presence of additional functional groups and structural features in Clarithromycin will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The moramide group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
