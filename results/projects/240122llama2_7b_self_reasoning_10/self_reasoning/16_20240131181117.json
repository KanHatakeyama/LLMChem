    "Reason": "2-pyridineacetamide has a melting point influenced by its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is acetamide, which has a melting point of -12.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The pyridine ring introduces rigidity and pi-system interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydroxyl group, estimated at around -5 \u00b0C.",
