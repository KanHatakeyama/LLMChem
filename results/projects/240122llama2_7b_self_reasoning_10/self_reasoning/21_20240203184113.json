    "Reason": "5-bromoindole has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of around 95 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. (2) The two phenyl groups contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
