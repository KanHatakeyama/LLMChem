    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at around -5 to -10\u00b0C. The norcamphor structure also exhibits a more rigid and planar structure, which can enhance intermolecular interactions and increase the melting point. The exact impact of this structural modification is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
