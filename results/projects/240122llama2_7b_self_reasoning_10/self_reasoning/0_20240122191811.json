    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is hexamethylene, which has a melting point of -11.2\u00b0C. Isocyanates have a high melting point due to the presence of multiple N-C=O bonds, which create strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. Each N-C=O bond can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C, resulting in a total increase of (6 x 10\u00b0C) = 60\u00b0C.",
