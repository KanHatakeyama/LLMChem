    "Reason": "1-propanamine has a melting point of -10.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an isopropyl group (\u2013CH(CH3)\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a raised melting point due to the increase in molecular weight but a more significant decrease due to the additional hydrogen bonding potential.",
