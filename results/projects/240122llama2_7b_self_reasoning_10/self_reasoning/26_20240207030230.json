    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The effect of the carbamate group is estimated to be around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
