    "Reason": "1-chlorooctane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the basic unit of octane, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant increase in melting point due to the strong electronegativity and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +70\u00b0C.",
