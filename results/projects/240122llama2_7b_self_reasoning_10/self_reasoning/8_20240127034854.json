    "Reason": "1,3-dianhydride compounds have a melting point around -100\u00b0C due to the presence of two carbonyl groups, which can participate in dipole-dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The cyanogen group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups and the cyanogen group can increase the melting point by approximately +70\u00b0C.",
