    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5\u00b0C. The addition of a peroxide group (-O-O-) increases the molecular weight and polarity, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The t-butyl group (-C(=O)CH3) is a non-polar branch that reduces the molecular weight and intermolecular interactions, lowering the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The peroxide group can form hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
