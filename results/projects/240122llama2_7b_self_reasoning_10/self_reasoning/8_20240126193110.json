    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl group: The 3-nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular interactions and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Phenyl group (2 phenyls): The two phenyl groups significantly enhance the melting point due to their ability to form rigid structures and increase molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,3,5-thiadiazol-2-one: The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The phenyl group (1 phenyl) can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
