    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point due to reduced hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
