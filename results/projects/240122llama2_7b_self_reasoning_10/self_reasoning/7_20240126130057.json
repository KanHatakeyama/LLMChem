    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 \u00b0C. The introduction of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +20 \u00b0C for each bromine atom. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
