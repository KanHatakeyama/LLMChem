    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The phenylmethyl group (Cc1ccccc1) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +20. The benzene ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at +20. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at -5.",
