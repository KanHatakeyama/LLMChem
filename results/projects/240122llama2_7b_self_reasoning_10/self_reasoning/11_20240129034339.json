    "Reason": "1E-N,N'-bis(4-methylphenyl)-2-[(4-methylphenyl)amino]ethanimidamide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanimidamide, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methylphenyl group (C)cc1 in the structure increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the amino group (N) and the methyl group (C) both contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The methyl group also increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight.",
