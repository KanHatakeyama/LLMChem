    "Reason": "1,2-diphenyl ethane has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is ethane, which has a melting point of -172 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in phenyl biguanide will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The biguanide group (N=C(N)NC(=N)N) introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
