    "Reason": "1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to butane, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can sterically hinder the butene moiety, reducing its ability to form hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure. The methyl group also introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C.",
