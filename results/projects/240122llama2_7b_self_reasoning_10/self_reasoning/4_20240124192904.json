    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The sulfur atom in the thiadiazole ring also contributes to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
