    "Reason": "2,6-dimethyl-4H-pyran-4-thione has a melting point of 120\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is pyran, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The methyl groups increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
