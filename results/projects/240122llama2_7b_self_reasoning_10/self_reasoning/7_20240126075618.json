    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a nitro group (\u2013NO2) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and dipole moment. Each nitro group may contribute around +50 to +70\u00b0C. Additionally, the aniline ring introduces two phenyl groups, which can contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The nitro group also introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. Lastly, the methylene bridge introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
