    "Reason": "2,6-dibromotoluene has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is toluene, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two bromine atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. Additionally, the bromine atoms create dipole-dipole interactions, which can further contribute to the melting point. The bromine atoms also increase the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The net effect should be a significant increase due to the combination of molecular size, dipole-dipole interactions, and increased molecular weight.",
