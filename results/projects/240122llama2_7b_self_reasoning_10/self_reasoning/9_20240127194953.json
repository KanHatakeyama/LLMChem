    "Reason": "1-amino-1-butanol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be butane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the amino group increases the melting point due to the presence of hydrogen bonding and the rigidity it brings. Each hydrogen bond can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can contribute to the melting point. The methyl group can add approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
