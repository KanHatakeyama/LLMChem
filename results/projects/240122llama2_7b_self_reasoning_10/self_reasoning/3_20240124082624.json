    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit of analysis is the 1-octanamine moiety, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The octyl group can also raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The presence of two methyl groups can also contribute to an increase in melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
