    "Reason": "2-Aminopropane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered propane (with a melting point of -18.0\u00b0C) because the amino group introduces a rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential, which raises the melting point. The amino group also introduces additional molecular weight, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
