    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the phenyl group increases the melting point due to the enhancement of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the hydroquinone moiety introduces two phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
