    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound can be considered cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional methyl groups. Methyl groups, when connected to a pentene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene, we have two additional methyl groups linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional methyl group can be estimated to add approximately 10\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
