    "Reason": "1,2-diiodomethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, methane, has a melting point of -161.5 degrees Celsius. The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The siloxane structure introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of 12 methyl groups reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, approximately -12 degrees Celsius.",
