    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. (2) The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. (3) The aniline ring introduces two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +30\u00b0C each due to increasing molecular weight and rigidity. (4) The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. (5) The methylene bridge introduces a rigid structure, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C.",
