    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). 2. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, a benzyl group, a propylidene group, and a hydrazono group. Each additional phenyl ring can be estimated to add approximately +20 due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, adding +10. The propylidene group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, adding +5. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, adding +5. 3. The presence of a methylene bridge can reduce the melting point due to the reduction in molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding site. The effect is estimated to be around -5.",
