    "Reason": "1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be 1,3,4-thiadiazole, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The tetrazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C.",
