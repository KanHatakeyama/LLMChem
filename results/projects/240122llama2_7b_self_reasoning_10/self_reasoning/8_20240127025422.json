    "Reason": "5-chloro-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-nitrophenol, which has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The nitro group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom's effect is more pronounced than the nitro group's due to the increased molecular weight and dipole moment.",
