    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The nitro functional group (\u2013NO2) can increase the melting point due to the presence of a strong dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure. Each nitro group may contribute around +50 to +70 \u00b0C. Additionally, the toluene ring introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its effect on the crystal lattice.",
