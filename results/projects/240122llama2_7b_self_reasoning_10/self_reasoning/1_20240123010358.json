    "Reason": "6-methylpyridine-2-carboxaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the basic unit of pyridine, which has a melting point of around 5\u00b0C. The methyl group adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The carboxaldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C due to the presence of a polar functional group and the potential for hydrogen bonding.",
