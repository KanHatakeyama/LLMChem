    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The methylene bridge (\u2013C\u2013) adds rigidity but reduces the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at around -10 degrees Celsius. The amine group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which raises the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The presence of eight methyl groups (\u2013C\u2013) adds approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
