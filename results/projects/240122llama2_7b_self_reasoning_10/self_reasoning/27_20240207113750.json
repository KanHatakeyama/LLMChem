    "Reason": "1-phenylcyclohexanol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclohexanol, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The cyclohexane ring introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +30\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, estimated at -5\u00b0C.",
