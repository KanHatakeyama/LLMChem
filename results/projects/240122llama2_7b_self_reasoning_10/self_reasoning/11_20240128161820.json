    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a phenyl group in the molecule increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The phenyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
