    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 100\u00b0C due to the presence of two phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
