    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-Pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a bromine atom increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the fluorine atoms also increase the molecular weight and rigidity, which further raises the melting point. The bromine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms also increase the molecular weight and rigidity, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
