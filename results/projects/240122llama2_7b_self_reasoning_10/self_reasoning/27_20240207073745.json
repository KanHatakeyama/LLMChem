    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with two furanyl groups, which introduces rigidity and pi-system, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The dioxime group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for two furanyl groups, we have +40\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one dioxime group at +70\u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system). This totals to an adjusted predicted increase of +180\u00b0C.",
