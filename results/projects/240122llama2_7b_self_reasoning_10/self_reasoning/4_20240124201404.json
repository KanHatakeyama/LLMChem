    "Reason": "1,1'-Methaqualone has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group, a phenyl group, and a methoxy group. The methyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the molecular structure includes a nitro group, which can contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
