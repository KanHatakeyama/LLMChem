    "Reason": "2-Aminopropane has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the amino group (\u2013NH2) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the amino group also introduces hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in propane, the additional amino group allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the amino group into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
