    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is furfuryl, which has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The isopropyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which raises the melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume. The isopropyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which raises the melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
