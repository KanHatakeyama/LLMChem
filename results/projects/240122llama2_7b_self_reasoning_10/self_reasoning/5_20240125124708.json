    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanol, also known as n-benzoylbenzamide, has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered benzene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The introduction of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The benzamide group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The benzoyl group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.
