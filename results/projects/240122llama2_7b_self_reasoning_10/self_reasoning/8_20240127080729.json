    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (base melting point: 100.0 \u00b0C) has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to benzene (melting point: 5.5 \u00b0C). The basic unit for comparison is 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications in perinaphthenone contribute to the melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which adds about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The naphthalene ring (O=C3C=Cc2cccc1cccc3c12) introduces additional rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each additional fused aromatic ring. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
