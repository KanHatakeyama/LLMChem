    "Reason": "4-Ethyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The ethyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The exact impact of these structural modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the ethyl group as approximately +10\u00b0C and the methoxy group as approximately -5\u00b0C.",
