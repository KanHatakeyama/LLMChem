    "Reason": "4-decylphenyl and methylbenzamide functional groups are present in N-(4-decylphenyl)-4-methylbenzamide. The decylphenyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, which raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methylbenzamide group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of these functional groups in N-(4-decylphenyl)-4-methylbenzamide will increase the melting point.",
