    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound can be considered as a phosphate group, which has a melting point of -100.0\u00b0C. The presence of three butyl groups can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of hydrogen bonding potential. Each butyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential.",
