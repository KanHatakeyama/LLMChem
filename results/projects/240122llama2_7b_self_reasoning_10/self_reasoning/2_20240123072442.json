    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the fluorine atoms also increase the van der Waals interactions, which can lower the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay between these two factors. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the increased van der Waals interactions between the fluorine atoms and the surrounding molecules can also lower the melting point. The exact effect of the fluorine atoms is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect as a rough estimate. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight by approximately +100% and the van der Waals interactions by approximately +50%.",
