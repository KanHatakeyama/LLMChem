    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a phenyl group (c1ccccc1) increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The o-phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
