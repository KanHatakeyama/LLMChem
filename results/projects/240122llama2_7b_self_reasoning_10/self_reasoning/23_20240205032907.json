    "Reason": "1,3-dodecanediamine has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,3-dodecanediamine, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of three additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the dodecyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10.",
