    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of aniline, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius.",
