    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The aniline ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C.",
