    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to strong electronegativity and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
