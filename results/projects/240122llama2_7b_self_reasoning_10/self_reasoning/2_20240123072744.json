    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its functional groups. The basic unit is acetanilide, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The chlorine atom increases the melting point due to its electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The fluorine atom also raises the melting point due to its electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The chlorine and fluorine atoms also increase the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which can contribute to the melting point.",
