    "Reason": "5-tert-butyl-2-methyl-3-furoic acid has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group, a furan ring, and a tert-butyl group. The methyl group adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The furan ring introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The tert-butyl group adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and the presence of a tert-butyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding.",
