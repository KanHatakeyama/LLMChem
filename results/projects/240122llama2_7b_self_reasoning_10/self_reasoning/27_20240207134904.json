    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. Two phenyl groups are present, which would significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C.",
