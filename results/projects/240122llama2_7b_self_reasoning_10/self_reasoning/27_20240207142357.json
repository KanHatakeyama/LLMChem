    "Reason": "1-amino-butane has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is butane, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in N-butylbutan-1-amine will affect its melting point: (1) The two phenyl groups can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which can add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The amino group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
