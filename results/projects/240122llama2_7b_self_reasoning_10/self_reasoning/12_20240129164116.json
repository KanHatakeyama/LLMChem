    "Reason": "4-methoxybenzylidene group introduces a bulky structure with increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20. The phenyl group contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl is estimated to add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methoxybenzylidene group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10. The oxazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10.",
