    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The stilbene ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one nitro group and one stilbene ring, we have +50\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure) and +30\u00b0C total (lesser due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system). This totals to an adjusted predicted increase of +80\u00b0C.",
