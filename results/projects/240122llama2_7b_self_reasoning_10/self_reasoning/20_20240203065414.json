    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for our comparison will be butane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. 2. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a heptanoate group, which introduces a carboxylate functional group and a methyl group. The carboxylate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its effect on the crystal lattice. 3. The heptanoate group can also increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and create a more rigid structure.",
