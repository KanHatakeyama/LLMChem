    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole has a melting point of 120\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the melting point of its constituent parts. This is due to the formation of a rigid, planar structure with increased van der Waals interactions between the imidazole ring and the carbonyl group. The imidazole ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The carbonyl group also enhances the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules.",
