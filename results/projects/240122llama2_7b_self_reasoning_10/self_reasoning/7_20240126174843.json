    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point that we can compare to the melting point of n-octanamine, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be n-octanamine. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1-octanamine will affect its melting point: (1) The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methyl group may add approximately +10 to +20 degrees Celsius. (2) The octyl group introduces a bulky structure, which raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The octyl group may add approximately +20 to +30 degrees Celsius.",
