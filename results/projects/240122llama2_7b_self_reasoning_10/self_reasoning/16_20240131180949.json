    "Reason": "4-ethoxyphenyl group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of polar functional groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C each. The propanamide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of three phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +60\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The ethoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.
