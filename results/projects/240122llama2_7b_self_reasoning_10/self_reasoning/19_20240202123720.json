    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of three carbonyl groups significantly increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius each.",
