    "Reason": "1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethylene (with a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C) because the tetrachloro group introduces significant rigidity and molecular weight, which raises the melting point. The tetrachloro group introduces significant rigidity and molecular weight, which raises the melting point. The exact impact of the tetrachloro group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. Ring formation: +35\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
