    "Reason": "2-piperidineethanol has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The piperidine ring introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The ethanol group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5\u00b0C.",
