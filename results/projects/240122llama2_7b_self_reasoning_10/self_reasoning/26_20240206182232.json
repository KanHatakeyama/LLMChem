    "Reason": "1,2,3,5-tetraiodobenzene has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The iodine atoms increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The iodine atoms also increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
