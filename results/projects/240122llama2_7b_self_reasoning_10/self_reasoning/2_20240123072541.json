    "Reason": "2-(dimethylamino)ethanol has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The presence of two methylamino groups increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the amino group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding. The net effect should be a decreased melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size and a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding.",
