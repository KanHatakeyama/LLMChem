    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
