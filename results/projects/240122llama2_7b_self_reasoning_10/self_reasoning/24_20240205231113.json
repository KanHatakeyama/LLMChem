    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-imidazolidine has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be 1,3,5-trimethyl-2-imidazolidine, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of three methyl groups and one phosphate group. The methyl groups add approximately +10 each due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The phosphate group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +10.",
