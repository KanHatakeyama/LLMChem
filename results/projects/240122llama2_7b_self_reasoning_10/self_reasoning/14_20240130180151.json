    "Reason": "1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is ethylene (with a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius) due to the lack of functional groups in tert-butylbenzene. The introduction of four chlorine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +100 degrees Celsius.",
