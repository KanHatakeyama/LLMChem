    "Reason": "1,3-Thiazole ring: The 1,3-thiazole ring introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group and methyl group introduce additional rigid structures, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigid structures, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces additional rigid structures, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
