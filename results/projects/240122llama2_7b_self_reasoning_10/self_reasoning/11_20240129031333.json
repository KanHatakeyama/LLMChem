    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). 2. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, a benzyl group, a propylidine chain, and a hydrazono group. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20. The propylidine chain introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +30. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +30. 3. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion can significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
