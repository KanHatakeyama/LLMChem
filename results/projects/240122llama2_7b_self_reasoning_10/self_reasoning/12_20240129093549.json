    "Reason": "4-(4-morpholinylmethyl)benzoic acid has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a morpholinylmethyl group, which introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The morpholinyl group itself can contribute around +20 due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. The methyl group can also contribute around +5 due to its ability to increase the melting point through molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The carbonyl group can also contribute around +40 due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure.",
