    "Reason": "1-phenylcarbamate compounds generally have a melting point increase due to the presence of a phenyl group, which can enhance pi-pi interactions and rigidity. The isopropyl group can also contribute to the melting point by introducing a hydrogen bond acceptor and a steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
