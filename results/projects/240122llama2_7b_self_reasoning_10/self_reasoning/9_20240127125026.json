    "Reason": "1,1'-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to reduced hydrogen bonding potential.
