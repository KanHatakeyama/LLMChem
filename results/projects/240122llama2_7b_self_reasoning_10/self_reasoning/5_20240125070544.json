    "Reason": "1,1,1,3,3,3-hexadeutero-2-propanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the structural modifications relative to the base melting point of propane, which is around -18.0\u00b0C. The presence of six deuterium atoms increases the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C each. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The deuterium atoms also enhance the hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute approximately +10\u00b0C. The structural modifications total approximately +60\u00b0C.",
