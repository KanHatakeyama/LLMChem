    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methyl groups and one ethyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional rigidity and molecular weight. Each methyl group can add approximately +10 degrees Celsius, and the ethyl group can add approximately +5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the carbonyl group can form hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
