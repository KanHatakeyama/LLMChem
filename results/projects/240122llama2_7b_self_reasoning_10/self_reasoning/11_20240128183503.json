    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point that can be analyzed by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups (C1CCCC1) increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the ethyl group (C1CCCC1) introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5. The butyl group (C1CCCC1) also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5. The carbonyl group (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CCCC)) introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5. The presence of two additional phenyl groups (C1CCCC1) increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
