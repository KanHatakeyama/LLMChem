    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is salicin, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of fluorine substituents increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the presence of a methoxy group can lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduction in molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding opportunity.",
