    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point influenced by its structural components. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The phenyl group, when considering its effect, should significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
