    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The p-nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The nitro group also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion can significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight.",
