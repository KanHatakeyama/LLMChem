    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperazine, also known as isouron, has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of piperazine, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an ethyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) and a methylene bridge (\u2013C(C)\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The methylene bridge also introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may lower the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The piperazine ring itself contributes to hydrogen bonding, which may raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
