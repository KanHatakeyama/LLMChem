    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, participating in hydrogen bonding and increasing the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The sulfur atom within the methylsulfanyl group introduces a rigid structure, participating in hydrogen bonding and increasing the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The diphenyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +40\u00b0C. The carboxylate group introduces a polar functional group, participating in hydrogen bonding and increasing the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups in the molecule raises the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight, van der Waals interactions, and the presence of polar functional groups.",
