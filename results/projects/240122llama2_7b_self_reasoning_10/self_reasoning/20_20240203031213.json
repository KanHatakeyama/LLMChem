    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of three hydroxyl groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +30\u00b0C each. Additionally, the ethyl group creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The presence of three methoxy groups can raise the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5\u00b0C each.",
