    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, acrylaldehyde, has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius.",
