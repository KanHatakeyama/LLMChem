    "Reason": "1,3-Butanediol has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered ethanol (with a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C) because the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group also introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, further contributing to the melting point. The methyl group also introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, further contributing to the melting point. The exact impact of the methyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. Ring formation: +10\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
