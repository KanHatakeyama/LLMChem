    "Reason": "1-methylcyclohexane has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be cyclohexane, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the additional functional group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a decreased melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size but a more significant decrease due to the additional hydrogen bonding.",
