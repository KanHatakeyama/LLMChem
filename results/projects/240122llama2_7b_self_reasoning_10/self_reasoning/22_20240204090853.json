    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius, based on the presence of two carbonyl groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and form a rigid structure, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +2 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can reduce the melting point by approximately -5 degrees Celsius due to steric hindrance.",
