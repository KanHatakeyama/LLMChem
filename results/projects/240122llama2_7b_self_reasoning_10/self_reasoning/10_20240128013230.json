    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol has a melting point of -119.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the isopropyl group (\u2013CH(CH3)2) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The methyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The acetate group introduces additional carbonyl functionalities, which can participate in dipole interactions and rigidify the structure, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The isopropyl group also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to increased molecular weight, rigidity, and hydrogen bonding.",
