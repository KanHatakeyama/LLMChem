    "Reason": "3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The carboxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group also introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
