    "Reason": "2-methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The methoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) adds approximately +5 \u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The aldehyde group (C=O) raises the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the crystalline structure's rigidity.",
