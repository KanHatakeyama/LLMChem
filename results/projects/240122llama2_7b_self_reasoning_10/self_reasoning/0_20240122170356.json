    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point of 100.5\u00b0C, which is relatively high compared to other nitro compounds. The presence of three nitro groups increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the molecule also has a planar, symmetrical structure, which can enhance the hydrogen bonding potential and lower the melting point. The net effect should be a moderate increase in melting point due to the molecular size and a more significant decrease due to the hydrogen bonding potential.",
