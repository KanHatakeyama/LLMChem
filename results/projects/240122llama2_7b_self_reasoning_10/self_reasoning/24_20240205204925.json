    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may contribute around +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the benzamide group can contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and volume, which might minutely raise the melting point. However, the presence of an ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) has a slight lowering effect because it does not participate in hydrogen bonding as intensely as a hydroxyl group would.",
