    "Reason": "1,3-dicyanopropane has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The cyano group is a strong electronegative group, which can increase the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding. The presence of two cyano groups can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C each.",
