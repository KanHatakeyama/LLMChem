    "Reason": "1-boc-3-hydroxyazetidine has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group, a hydroxyl group, and a carbonyl functional group. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20 \u00b0C.",
