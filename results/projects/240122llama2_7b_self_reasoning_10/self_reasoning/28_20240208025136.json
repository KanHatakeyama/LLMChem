    "Reason": "2,6-dibromotoluene has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be the melting point of toluene, which has a melting point of -10.0\u00b0C. The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding. Each bromine atom can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding.",
