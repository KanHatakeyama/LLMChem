    "Reason": "1,2-dihydroacenaphthylen-5-yl and phenyl groups both contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The quinoxaline base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a planar, aromatic system with a high melting point. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C.",
