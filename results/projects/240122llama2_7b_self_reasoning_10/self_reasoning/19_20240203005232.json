    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a 2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional functional group and the rigidity it brings. The methyl group also adds to the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which can contribute to a higher melting point. The exact impact of these functional groups is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the 2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl group as +20 to +30\u00b0C and the methyl group as +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
