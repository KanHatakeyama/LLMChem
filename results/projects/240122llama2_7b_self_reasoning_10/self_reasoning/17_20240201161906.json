    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The sulfur atom within the methylsulfanyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar interactions, estimated at +30\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The diphenyl group introduces additional pi-stacking interactions and rigidity, estimated at +40\u00b0C. The cyclopentene ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C.",
