    "Reason": "The compound under consideration contains a benzamide functional group, which is known to increase the melting point due to the presence of aromaticity and the ability of the amide group to form hydrogen bonds. The benzene ring also contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and high electronegativity. The methyl group on the nitrogen atom can also contribute to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and volume.",
