    "Reason": "1,3-thiourea has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The guanyl group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The thiourea group introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
