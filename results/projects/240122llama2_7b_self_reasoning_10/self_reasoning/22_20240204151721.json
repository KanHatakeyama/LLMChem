    "Reason": "2,6-dibromotoluene has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be toluene, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two bromine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius per group. The bromine atoms also increase the melting point due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
