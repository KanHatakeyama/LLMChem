    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The acetate group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The ester group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion can significantly augment the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
