    "Reason": "1-dodecanol has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to the presence of a saturated hydrocarbon chain with a melting point of around 10\u00b0C. The additional functional group of a dodecanol molecule is a hydroxyl group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
