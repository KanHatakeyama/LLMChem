    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a trichloromethyl group (\u2013ClC(Cl)Cl) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The chlorine atom also participates in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The acetamide group (\u2013OC(C)=O) introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The trichloromethyl group introduces a significant increase due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The chlorine atom also participates in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The acetamide group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The trichloromethyl group and chlorine atom have a greater effect due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The acetamide group and methyl group have a lesser effect due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
