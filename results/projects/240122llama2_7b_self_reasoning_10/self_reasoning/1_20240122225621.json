    "Reason": "1,2,3,5-tetraiodobenzene is a compound with a melting point that needs to be predicted. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The iodine atoms in this compound can significantly increase the melting point due to their high electronegativity and ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions, estimated to add around +100\u00b0C for each iodine atom. Additionally, the rigidity and molecular weight of the iodinated benzene structure can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
