    "Reason": "2-ethylhexylacetate has a melting point that we can compare to the melting point of ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional carbon atoms, a methyl group, and an ethyl group, increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The ethyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The methyl group introduces additional rigidity, which can raise the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay of factors, including increased molecular weight, rigidity, and hydrogen bonding.",
