    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functional groups are known to increase the melting point due to their increased molecular weight and rigidity. The chlorine atom also adds a significant contribution due to its electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. The trifluoromethyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which may slightly lower the melting point. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom can increase the melting point by approximately +100\u00b0C due to its electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. The trifluoromethyl group can also contribute +20\u00b0C due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding. The 3-chlorophenyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C due to its rigidity and increased molecular weight.",
