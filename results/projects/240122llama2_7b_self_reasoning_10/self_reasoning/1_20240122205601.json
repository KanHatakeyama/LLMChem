    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be methanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a tert-butyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The acrylate group (\u2013CO\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) also contributes to the molecular weight and rigidity, further increasing the melting point. The presence of a tert-butyl group can also enhance the hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay between the tert-butyl group and the acrylate group, with the former increasing the melting point and the latter decreasing it.",
