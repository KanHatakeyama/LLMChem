    "Reason": "4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is piperidine, which has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C. The introduction of a 4-chlorophenyl group increases the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The hydroxyl group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to dipole interactions.",
