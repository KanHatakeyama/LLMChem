    "Reason": "2,5-Bis(1-naphthyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole has a melting point that we can compare to naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +100 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the oxadiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
