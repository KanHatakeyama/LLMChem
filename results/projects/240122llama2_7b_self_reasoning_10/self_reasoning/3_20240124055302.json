    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. Benzoyl peroxide has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The presence of a peroxide group can significantly lower the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and the potential for hydrogen peroxide to act as a strong reducing agent, which can disrupt crystalline structure and increase the melting point. The methoxyphenoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The carbamate group can also increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The effects are additive.",
