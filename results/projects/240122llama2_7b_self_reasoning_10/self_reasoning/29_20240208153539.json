    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The pyrazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at +10\u00b0C.",
