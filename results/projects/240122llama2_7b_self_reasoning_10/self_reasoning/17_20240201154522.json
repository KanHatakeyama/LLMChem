    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenyl can increase the melting point due to the additional pi-system and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The carbonyl group raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to the formation of a rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding.",
