    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be anthracene, which has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of four additional phenyl rings increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
