    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces a methoxy functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces a carbamate functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces a methoxy functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The dioxane-like bridging moiety introduces a rigid structure, adding approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
