    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be 2-methylanisole, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius.",
