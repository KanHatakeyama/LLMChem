    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanamine has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered ethanamine (with a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C) because the two phenyl groups significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the biguanide group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
