    "Reason": "2-chloroethyl sulfide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethyl sulfide, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
