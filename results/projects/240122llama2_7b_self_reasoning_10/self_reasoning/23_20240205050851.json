    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The phenylmethyl group introduces a rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius.",
