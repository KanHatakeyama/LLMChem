    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered 2-methylanisole, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
