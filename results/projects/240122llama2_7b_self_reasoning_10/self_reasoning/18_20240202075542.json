    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of three phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The presence of three phenyl groups, the nitro group, and the piperidine ring contribute to an increase in the melting point. The effects are additive.",
