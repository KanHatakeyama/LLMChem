    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methylpropane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
