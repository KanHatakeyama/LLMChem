    "Reason": "2,6-dibromotoluene has a melting point that we can compare to toluene, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be toluene, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the bromine atoms also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
