    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The functional groups in this compound contribute to the melting point as follows: (1) The phenyl group (C1=CC=CC=C1) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +30\u00b0C; (2) The methyl sulfone group (C(=O)O) introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +10\u00b0C; (3) The bromine atom (Br) raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
