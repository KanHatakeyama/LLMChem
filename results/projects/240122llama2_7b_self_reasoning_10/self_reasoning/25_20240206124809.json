    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chloromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The two chlorine atoms increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 2 chlorines) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
