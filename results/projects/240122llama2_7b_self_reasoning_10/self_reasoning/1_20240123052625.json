    "Reason": "1-chlorooctane has a melting point that can be estimated by comparing it to the melting point of octane, which is around -110\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C due to increased intermolecular forces. The additional weight of the chlorine atom also contributes to the melting point, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
