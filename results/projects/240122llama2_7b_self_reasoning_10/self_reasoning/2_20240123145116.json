    "Reason": "1-dodecanol has a melting point of 10.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is a saturated hydrocarbon chain with 12 carbon atoms, which has a melting point of approximately 10\u00b0C. The presence of a dodecanol structure does not significantly alter the melting point due to the lack of functional groups that can significantly impact the crystal lattice stability.",
