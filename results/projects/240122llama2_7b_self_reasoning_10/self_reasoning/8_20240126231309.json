    "Reason": "9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The fluorenyl group itself contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each fluorenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, contributing around +40\u00b0C. The succinimide group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups in N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy)succinimide will increase the melting point due to their effect on molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
