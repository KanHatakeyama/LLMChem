    "Reason": "1,3-Benzodioxole base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, due to the presence of two carbonyl groups and the rigid structure they form. The methylene bridge (O=C1C(SC2=NCCCN12)=Cc4ccc3OCOc3c4) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20. The thiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +30. The pyrimidine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +20. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at around -5.",
