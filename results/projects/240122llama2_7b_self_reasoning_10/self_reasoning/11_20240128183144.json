    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene (cis) has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethene, which has a melting point of -169.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The cis-configuration also introduces some rigidity, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
