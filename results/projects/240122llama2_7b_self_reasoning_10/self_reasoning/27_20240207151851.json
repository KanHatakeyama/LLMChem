    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of dinitrogen, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
