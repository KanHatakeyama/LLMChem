    "Reason": "2-Methylaziridine has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and increases the molecular weight, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The aziridine ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
