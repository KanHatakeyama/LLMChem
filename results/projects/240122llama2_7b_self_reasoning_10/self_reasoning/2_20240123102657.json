    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The phenyl group adds approximately +20 \u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The hydroquinone moiety introduces a dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The ketone group can also contribute to the melting point due to its polar carbonyl interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C.",
