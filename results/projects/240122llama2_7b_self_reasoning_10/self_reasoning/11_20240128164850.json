    "Reason": "2-Methyl-cyclopentanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentane, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
