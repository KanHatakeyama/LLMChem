    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the fluorine atoms also increase the van der Waals interactions, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a decreased melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size but a more significant decrease due to the increased van der Waals interactions.",
