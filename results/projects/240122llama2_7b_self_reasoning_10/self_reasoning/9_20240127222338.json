    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The methyl groups can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The dimethyl substitution also introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, which may contribute approximately +20\u00b0C. The cis-configuration can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular rigidity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
