    "Reason": "3,3,3-trifluoro-N-(1-methylpropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide has a basic melting point of around 5\u00b0C due to the presence of a benzene ring. The trifluoromethyl group (CF3) can increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity. The methyl group (CH3) can also contribute to the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to its increased molecular weight and potential hydrogen bonding. The trifluoromethyl group can also participate in dipole interactions, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms can also increase the melting point due to their high electronegativity and ability to participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each.",
