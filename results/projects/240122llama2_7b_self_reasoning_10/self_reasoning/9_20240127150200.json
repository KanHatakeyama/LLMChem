    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline, the base unit, has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups (\u2013CH3) increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the oxide group (\u2013O\u2013) introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, lowering the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
