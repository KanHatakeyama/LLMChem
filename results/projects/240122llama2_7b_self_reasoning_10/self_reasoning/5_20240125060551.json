    "Reason": "1,1'-Physostigmine has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is the melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a methoxy group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of physostigmine, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to its additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
