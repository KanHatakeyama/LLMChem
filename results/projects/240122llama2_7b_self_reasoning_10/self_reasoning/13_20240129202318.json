    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The introduction of three hydroxyethyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The hydroxyl groups also enhance hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The presence of three methoxy groups reduces the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity they introduce; we can estimate this at around -5\u00b0C for each methoxy group. Summing up these changes: Cyanuric acid base (+106\u00b0C), three hydroxyethyl groups (+30\u00b0C), and three methoxy groups (-15\u00b0C).",
