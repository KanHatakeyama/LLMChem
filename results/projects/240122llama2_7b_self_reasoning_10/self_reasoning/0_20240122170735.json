    "Reason": "9H-Xanthen-9-ol is a molecule with a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The molecule contains a benzene ring, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of the benzene ring increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Additionally, the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the benzene ring participates in hydrogen bonding, which also increases the melting point. The other functional groups in the molecule, such as the methyl and ethyl groups, do not significantly affect the melting point. Therefore, the melting point of 9H-Xanthen-9-ol can be estimated by adding the melting point of the benzene ring to the melting point of the hydroxyl group.",
