    "Reason": "1-methyl-4-nitronaphthalene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C.",
