    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point of 105.5\u00b0C. Starting with the base unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we need to consider the structural modifications that contribute to the increased melting point. The two phenyl groups in 2-phenylimidazole increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which contribute to an estimated +20\u00b0C increase in melting point. The imidazole ring also contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, which can enhance intermolecular interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The nitrogen atom in the imidazole ring can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further contribute to the melting point increase. However, the actual value may be lower due to the presence of conjugated double bonds, which can reduce the effect of the imidazole ring on the melting point.",
