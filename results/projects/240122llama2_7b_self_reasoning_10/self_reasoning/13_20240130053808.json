    "Reason": "2-methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The aldehyde group also contributes to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
