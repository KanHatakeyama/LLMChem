    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The furanyl group (Cc1ccco1) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The isopropyl group (C2=O) increases the molecular weight and volume, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group (C=O) creates a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The nitro group (NC(=O)N) creates a strong dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group (C1=O) adds a small increase in molecular weight and volume, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
