    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups (\u2013CH3) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. Additionally, the dimethyl substitution introduces more hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The net effect is a decreased melting point due to the combination of molecular size and hydrogen bonding.",
