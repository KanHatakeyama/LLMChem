    "Reason": "2-Amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is the pyridine ring, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The chlorine and fluorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each.",
