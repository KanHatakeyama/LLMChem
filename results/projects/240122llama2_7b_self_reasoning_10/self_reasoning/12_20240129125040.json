    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The anthracene base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to its planar, aromatic structure and rigidity. The nitro group's effect might be around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups might raise the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The anthracene base itself has a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius due to its planar, aromatic structure and rigidity. The nitro group's effect might be around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups might raise the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
