    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a melting point of around -100 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. Summing up these changes: The basic unit for our comparison will be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group and a methyl group. The methoxy group introduces hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius.",
