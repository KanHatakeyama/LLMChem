    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20. The oxo-functional introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +30. The methylene-phenyl linkage introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +20. The effects are additive.",
