    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point of 120.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a butyl group (C(=O)C(=O)C1(CCCC)) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the ethyl group (C(=O)C(=O)C1) adds approximately +20 due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity. The butyl group also increases the molecular weight and size, but to a lesser extent due to its larger size and increased rigidity. The net effect is a moderate increase in melting point due to the butyl group.",
