    "Reason": "2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl alcohol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of three methyl groups and one benzyl group increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The methyl groups also increase the hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10. The methyl groups and benzyl group can be estimated as follows: (1) The three methyl groups add approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10.",
