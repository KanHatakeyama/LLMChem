    "Reason": "1,2-dihydroacenaphthylen-5-yl and phenyl groups both contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The quinoxaline base itself contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
