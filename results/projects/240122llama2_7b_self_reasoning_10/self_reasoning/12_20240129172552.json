    "Reason": "1-(2-nitro),2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The two phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky side chain, raising the melting point by approximately +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The dibenzoyl group introduces two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The hydrazine group introduces a strong hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +30 \u00b0C.",
