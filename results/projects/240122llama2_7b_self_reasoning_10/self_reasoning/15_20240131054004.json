    "Reason": "3,5-dichlorophenol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a chlorine atom, which introduces a strong withdrawing group that can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the phenol group can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
