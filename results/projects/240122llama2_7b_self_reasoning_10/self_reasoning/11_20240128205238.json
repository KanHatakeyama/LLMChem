    "Reason": "1,5-Anhydro-1-deoxorugulose, also known as squalene, has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be the melting point of deoxy sugar, which is around -100 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in squalene will affect its melting point: (1) The presence of two fused aromatic rings increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated at around +25 degrees Celsius for each additional fused ring. (2) The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. (3) The hydroxyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. (4) The carbonyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
