    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The nitro group can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C due to its dipole moment and potential hydrogen bonding interactions. The anilide group can also contribute to the melting point, but its exact impact depends on the specific compound. In general, anilides tend to increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to their rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding interactions. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, approximately +20\u00b0C each, due to their increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
