    "Reason": "2-Methylaziridine has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and increases the molecular weight, which raises the melting point. The aziridine ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding. The exact impact of the methyl group and aziridine ring is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the methyl group as a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The aziridine ring introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
