    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the hydroxylamine group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the phenyl group, estimated at around +2\u00b0C each.",
