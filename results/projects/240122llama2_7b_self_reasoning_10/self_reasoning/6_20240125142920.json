    "Reason": "1,1'-Carboniban, a compound with a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius, can be used as a base for comparison. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group, which tends to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The isopropyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can contribute to a higher melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
