    "Reason": "2-Amino-3,5-dimethylphenyl and phenyl groups, when connected, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The 2-amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5\u00b0C each.",
