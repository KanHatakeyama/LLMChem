    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 30 degrees Celsius. Two phenyl groups are present, which would significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the benzene ring introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
