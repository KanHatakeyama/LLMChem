    "Reason": "1-Nitro-functionality introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Two phenyl groups, while having a lower increase than a benzene-derivative due to steric hindrance and reduced pi-pi interactions, still add +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which raises the melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The hydrazono-functionalities and thiadiazole ring introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for three phenyl groups, we have +60\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +50\u00b0C, the carbonyl function at +30\u00b0C (lesser than a typical ketone due to conjugation and steric hindrance by the adjacent large groups), and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +40\u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system). This totals to an adjusted predicted increase of +180\u00b0C.",
