    "Reason": "1-benzyloxy-3-iodobenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The benzene ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
