    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be piperazine, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of an acetate ester group can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group can lower the melting point due to its small size and limited ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -5\u00b0C.",
