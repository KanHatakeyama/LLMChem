    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline, the base unit for comparison, has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications in clobenzepam contribute to the melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which adds about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
