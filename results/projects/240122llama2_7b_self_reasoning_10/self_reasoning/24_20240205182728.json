    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The benzyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
