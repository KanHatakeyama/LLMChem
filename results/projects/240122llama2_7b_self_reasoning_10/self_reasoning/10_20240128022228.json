    "Reason": "5-bromoindole has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The indole ring introduces pi-pi interactions and rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The bromine atom also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C.",
