    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered 2-nitropyridine, which has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The pyridine ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20\u00b0C.",
