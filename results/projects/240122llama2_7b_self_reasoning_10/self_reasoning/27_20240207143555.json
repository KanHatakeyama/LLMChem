    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
