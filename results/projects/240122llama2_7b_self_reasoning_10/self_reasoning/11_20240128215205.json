    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-chloroaniline has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for our comparison will be 1-chloro-2-propanol, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C. The nitrogen atom introduces a rigid structure, participating in hydrogen bonding and increasing the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate decrease of -5\u00b0C.",
