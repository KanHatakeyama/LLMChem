    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The benzamide-like bridging moiety introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
