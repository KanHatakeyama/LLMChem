    "Reason": "3,3'-thiodipropionic acid has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is propionic acid, which has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. However, the sulfur atom in the thio group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. Summing up these changes: Propionic acid base (+100.0 degrees Celsius), two carbonyl groups (+20.0 degrees Celsius), and one sulfur atom (+5.0 degrees Celsius).",
