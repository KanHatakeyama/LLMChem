    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene (cis) has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be ethene (with a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C) because the cis-configuration introduces a rigid structure with a melting point-raising effect. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C. The cis-configuration also introduces some steric hindrance, reducing the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C.",
