    "Reason": "1,3-propanedithiol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom in the thiol group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. The sulfur atom also introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, further increasing the melting point. The exact impact of the sulfur atom is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the sulfur atom as a rough estimate. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
