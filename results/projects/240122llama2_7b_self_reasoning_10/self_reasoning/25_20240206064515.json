    "Reason": "1,2,3-Trinitro compounds have a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of three nitro groups significantly increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each nitro group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
