    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (benzene-like) has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of four methoxy groups (\u2013OCH3) in place of hydrogen atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. Each methoxy group introduces approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Additionally, the methoxy group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius.",
