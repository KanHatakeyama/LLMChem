    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The aldehyde group can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at +2\u00b0C.",
