    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may add approximately +30 to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity.",
