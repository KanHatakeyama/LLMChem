    "Reason": "1-bromohexadecane has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is hexadecane (C16), which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the adjacent carbon atoms, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a slight increase due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at around +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of 16 carbon atoms contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +10 degrees Celsius per carbon atom.",
