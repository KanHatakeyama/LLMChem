    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-nitrobenzene has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl groups add approximately +10\u00b0C due to their effect on the crystal lattice and molecular weight.",
