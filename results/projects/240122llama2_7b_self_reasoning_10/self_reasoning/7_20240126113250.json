    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure and creates a more asymmetric structure, which can increase the melting point. The acetamide group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can also increase the melting point. The azide group introduces a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, lowering the melting point. The sulfonyl group creates a more rigid structure, which can increase the melting point. The acetamide group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can also increase the melting point. The azide group introduces a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, lowering the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay of structural components, with the sulfonyl group contributing to rigidity and the acetamide and azide groups contributing to hydrogen bonding.",
