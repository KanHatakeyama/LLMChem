    "Reason": "2,4-dibromobenzene has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. (2) Two bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. (3) The additional functional groups and structural features in 2,4-dibromobenzene will affect its melting point: (a) The two phenyl groups can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (b) The bromine atoms can participate in hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +10 each. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
