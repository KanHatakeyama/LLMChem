    "Reason": "1,3-diphenylpropane has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The presence of a phenyl group generally increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carboxamide group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The hydrazine group introduces a strong dipole, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
