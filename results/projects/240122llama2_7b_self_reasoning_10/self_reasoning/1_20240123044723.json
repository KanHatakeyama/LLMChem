    "Reason": "1-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, pyrrole, has a melting point of -109 degrees Celsius. The methyl group adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The carboxylic acid functional group can also contribute to the melting point, with a typical increase of +20 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a carboxyl group. The overall effect of these modifications is estimated to be approximately +40 degrees Celsius.",
