    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two carbonyl groups, which generally increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the presence of two methoxy groups tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C.",
