    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 100 degrees Celsius) with two fused aromatic rings, which add approximately +25 degrees Celsius for each additional fused ring. The methoxy group (Oc1ccc(cc1)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom (Cl) raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (C(=O)N(C)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
