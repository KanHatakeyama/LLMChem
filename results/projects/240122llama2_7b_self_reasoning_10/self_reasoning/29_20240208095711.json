    "Reason": "1-methylcyclohexane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom reduces the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also increases the molecular weight and volume, which might minutely raise the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
