    "Reason": "1,4-Naphthalenediol base, with two additional phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The two methoxy groups introduce additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius each. The naphthalene ring formation introduces additional rigidity, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The di-functional structure introduces additional rigidity, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
