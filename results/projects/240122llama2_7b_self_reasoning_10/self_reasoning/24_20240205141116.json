    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The aniline ring formation introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would notably augment the melting point. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
