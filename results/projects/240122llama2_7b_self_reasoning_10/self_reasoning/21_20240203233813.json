    "Reason": "4-iodobenzylamine has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The amine group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The iodine atom also introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
