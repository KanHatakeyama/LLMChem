    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole is a rigid structure with a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group can increase the melting point due to the dipole moment and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +50\u00b0C. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group can form hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The Incasan base has a melting point of around -100\u00b0C.",
