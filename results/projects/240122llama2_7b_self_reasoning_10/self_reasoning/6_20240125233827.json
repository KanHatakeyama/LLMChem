    "Reason": "1,5-Dimethylhexane has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The cyclohexyl group (Cc1ccc(cc1)) adds approximately +20 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The toluene sulfonate group (S(=O)(=O)OC2CCCCC2) adds approximately +30 due to the presence of a sulfonate group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point.",
