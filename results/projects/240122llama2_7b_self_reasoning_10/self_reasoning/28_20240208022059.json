    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methylpropane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each bromine atom can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can contribute to the melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The exact impact of the methyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate its effect as a rough estimate. The methyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
