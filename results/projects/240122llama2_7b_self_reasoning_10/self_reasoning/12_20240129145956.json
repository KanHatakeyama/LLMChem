    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group and increases intermolecular forces by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group also contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The acetonitrile group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
