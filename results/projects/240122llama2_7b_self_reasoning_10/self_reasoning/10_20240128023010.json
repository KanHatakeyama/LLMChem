    "Reason": "2-Methylcyclopentanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentane, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius (each methyl group is less influential due to the small size and limited impact on the crystal lattice).",
