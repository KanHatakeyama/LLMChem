    "Reason": "9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The fluorenyl group itself contributes to the melting point due to its high molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, estimated at around +40\u00b0C. The succinimide group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight, van der Waals interactions, and hydrogen bonding.",
