    "Reason": "5-tert-butyl-2-methyl-3-furoic acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is furan, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The tert-butyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and rigidity. The carbonyl group introduces a significant increase in melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and rigidity. The furanyl ring introduces a significant increase in melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and rigidity. The net effect is a significant increase in melting point due to the combination of these structural components.",
