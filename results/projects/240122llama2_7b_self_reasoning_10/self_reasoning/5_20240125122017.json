    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the ethoxy group (\u2013OCH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the acetate group (\u2013COO\u2013) introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The ethoxy group also increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The net effect should be a raised melting point due to the combination of increased molecular weight, size, and hydrogen bonding potential.",
