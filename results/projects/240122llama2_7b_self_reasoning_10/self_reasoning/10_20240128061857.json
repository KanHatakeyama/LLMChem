    "Reason": "1E-N-hydroxy-1-(4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl)propan-1-imine has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 1-propan-1-imine, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. (2) The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. (3) The methyl group reduces the melting point due to its small size and limited ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately -5 degrees Celsius. (4) The trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. (5) The imine group introduces a dipole moment, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
