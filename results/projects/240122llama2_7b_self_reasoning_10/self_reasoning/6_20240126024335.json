    "Reason": "1-propene has a melting point of -169.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the propene chain, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom also introduces a significant dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
