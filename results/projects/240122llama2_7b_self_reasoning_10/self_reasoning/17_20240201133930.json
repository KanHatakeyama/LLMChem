    "Reason": "2-hydrazinobenzothiazole has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzothiazole, which has a melting point of 70 degrees Celsius. The hydrazine group introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular interactions and melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The thiazole ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
