    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is imidazole, which has a melting point of -15.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the carbonyl group introduces a dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The imidazole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
