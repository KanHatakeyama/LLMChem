    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrafluorobenzene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of four fluorine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine, which raises the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms also increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which can contribute to a higher melting point.",
