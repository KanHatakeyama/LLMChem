    "Reason": "2-Methyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to cyclopentane, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C.",
