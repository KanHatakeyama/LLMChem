    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant increase due to the formation of iodine-containing compounds, which have a higher melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a halogen. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The iodine atom raises the melting point due to the formation of iodine-containing compounds, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C.",
