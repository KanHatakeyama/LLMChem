    "Reason": "1-chlorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can sterically hinder the crystal lattice, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
