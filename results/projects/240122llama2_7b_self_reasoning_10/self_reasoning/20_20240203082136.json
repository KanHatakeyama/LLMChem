    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is phenol, which has a melting point around 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two nitro groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C each. The amino group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C. The dinitro group creates two additional phenyl rings, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
