    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The compound we are comparing has a similar structural arrangement to 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two fluorine substituents increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. The fluorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. The fluorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure.",
