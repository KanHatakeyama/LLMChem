    "Reason": "1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy-, tri has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 2-hydroxy-propane, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of three carboxylic acid groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +30\u00b0C each. Additionally, the hydroxyl group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group can also participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The presence of three methoxy groups can reduce the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5\u00b0C each. The tri-functional structure introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
