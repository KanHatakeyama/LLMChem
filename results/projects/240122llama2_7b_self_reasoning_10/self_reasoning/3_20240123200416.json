    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces a rigid structure, participating in hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar interactions, estimated at +30\u00b0C. The chlorine and fluorine atoms also increase the molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point, estimated at +10\u00b0C each.",
