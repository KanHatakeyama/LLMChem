    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities significantly increase the melting point due to the introduction of additional rigid structures and hydrogen bonding potential. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C per group, totaling +30\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The 3-chlorophenyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C.",
