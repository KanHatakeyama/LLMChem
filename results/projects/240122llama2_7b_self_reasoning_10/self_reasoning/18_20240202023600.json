    "Reason": "1-acetyl-2-phenylhydrazino group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20. The phenyl group in the acetamide base also contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +20. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40. The hydrazono-functionalities and phenyl group introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
