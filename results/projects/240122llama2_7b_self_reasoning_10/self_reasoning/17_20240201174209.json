    "Reason": "1-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered pyrrole, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
