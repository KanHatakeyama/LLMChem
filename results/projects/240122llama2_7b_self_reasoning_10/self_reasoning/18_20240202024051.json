    "Reason": "5-tert-butyl-2-methyl-3-furoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky structure, which can increase the melting point due to steric hindrance and molecular weight. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30 \u00b0C. The furan ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C.",
