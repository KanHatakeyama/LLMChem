    "Reason": "1H-carbazole has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered as a fused aromatic ring, which significantly increases the melting point due to the enhancement of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each additional phenyl group can add approximately +30 to +50\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Additionally, the tetrahydro-functionality introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C.",
