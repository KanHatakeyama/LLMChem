    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The presence of two additional phenyl rings and a nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The dinitro group introduces two additional nitro functionalities, which significantly increase the melting point due to the significant withdrawing groups they represent. Each nitro group can raise the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C due to the significant dipole moment and the rigidity it introduces.",
