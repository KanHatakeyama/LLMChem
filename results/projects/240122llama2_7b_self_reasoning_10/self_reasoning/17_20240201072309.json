    "Reason": "1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to stilbene, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Two phenyl groups (+20\u00b0C), one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C), and one methyl group (-5\u00b0C).",
