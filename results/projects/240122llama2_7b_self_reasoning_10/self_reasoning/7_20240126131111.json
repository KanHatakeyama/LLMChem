    "Reason": "1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy-, tri has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 \u00b0C. The introduction of three hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Each hydroxyl group can add approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the carboxylic acid group (\u2013COOH) introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point by approximately +5 due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The hydroxyl groups and carboxylic acid group can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to the hydroxyl groups and a lowered melting point due to the carboxylic acid group. The effects are additive.",
