    "Reason": "1,3-dibromopropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius each.",
