    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-imidazolidine has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of three butyl groups significantly increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. Each butyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Additionally, the phosphate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may further contribute to the melting point.",
