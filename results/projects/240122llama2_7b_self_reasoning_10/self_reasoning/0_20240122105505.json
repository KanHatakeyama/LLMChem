    "Reason": "Sesamolin is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, including a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group, and a phenolic hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl group is known to increase the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding, while the carbonyl group can also contribute to hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The phenolic hydroxyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. However, the presence of multiple functional groups can also lead to a decrease in the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the resulting decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds available for hydrogen bonding. The exact effect of each functional group on the melting point is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
