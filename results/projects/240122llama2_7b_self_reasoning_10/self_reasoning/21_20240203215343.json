    "Reason": "1,2,3-Trinitro compounds have a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of three nitro groups increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each nitro group can be estimated to add approximately 50\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
