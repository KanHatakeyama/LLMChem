    "Reason": "2,2'-Bis(2-bromo-3-phenylpropyl)-4,4',7,7,7',7'-hexamethyl-2,2'-bi(bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)-3,3'-dione has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ring, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds. The phenyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and their rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl groups have a negligible effect on the melting point. The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ring has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms will increase it by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the formation of hydrogen bonds. The phenyl groups will increase it by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and their rigidity. The methyl groups have a negligible effect on the melting point.",
