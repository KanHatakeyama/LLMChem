    "Reason": "2,3,4-tribromothiophene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of three bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of a rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C per bromine atom, totaling +60\u00b0C.",
