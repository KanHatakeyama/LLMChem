    "Reason": "1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane has a melting point that we can compare to butane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two epoxide groups (\u2013O\u2013O\u2013) increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The epoxide group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
