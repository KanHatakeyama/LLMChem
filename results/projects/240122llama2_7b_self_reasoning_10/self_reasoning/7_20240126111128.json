    "Reason": "1,1'-Physostigmine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is the piperidine ring, which has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, is estimated to add about +25\u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The molecular structure also includes a methoxy group, which can raise the melting point by about +5\u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2\u00b0C for each ether. Additionally, physostigmine possesses a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5\u00b0C for this structural feature.",
