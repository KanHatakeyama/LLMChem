    "Reason": "2-methylcyclopentanone has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and increases the molecular weight, contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The cyclopentanone ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
