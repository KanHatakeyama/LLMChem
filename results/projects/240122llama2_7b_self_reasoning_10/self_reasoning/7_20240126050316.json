    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point by approximately -2 degrees Celsius due to decreased hydrogen bonding potential. The methoxy group might raise it by +2 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
