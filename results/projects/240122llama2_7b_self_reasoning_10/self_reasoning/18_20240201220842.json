    "Reason": "2-Amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be the pyridine ring, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The introduction of a fluorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding.",
