    "Reason": "1,6-hexanediol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a hexyl group (C6H13) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Each hexyl group can be estimated to add approximately 20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. Additionally, the acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
