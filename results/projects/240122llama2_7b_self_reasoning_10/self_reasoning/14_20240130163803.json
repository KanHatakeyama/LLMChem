    "Reason": "1,1'-Physostigmine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be the piperidine ring, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups and a methoxy group increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups and a methoxy group increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
