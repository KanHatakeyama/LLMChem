    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-cyanopyridine has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit we can compare to is 2-chlorobenzene, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2-bromo-4-cyanopyridine will affect its melting point: (1) The pyridine ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C; (2) The bromine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
