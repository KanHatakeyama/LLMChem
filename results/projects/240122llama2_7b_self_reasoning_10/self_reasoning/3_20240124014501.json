    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its functional groups. The basic unit we can compare to is phenol, which has a melting point of around 5\u00b0C. The amino group introduces a basic nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The two nitro groups contribute to a significant dipole moment, which can enhance intermolecular forces and increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C each. The dinitro group introduces two additional nitrogen atoms, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C each. The presence of these functional groups raises the melting point significantly.",
