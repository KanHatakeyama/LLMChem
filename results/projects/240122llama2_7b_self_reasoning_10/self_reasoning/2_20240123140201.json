    "Reason": "3-amino-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazole has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its functional groups. The basic unit is pyrazole, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The 4-chlorophenyl group increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The amino group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom can also participate in dipole interactions, which may raise the melting point by around +5\u00b0C.",
