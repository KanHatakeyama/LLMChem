    "Reason": "3-amino-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1-phenylhydrazine, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The introduction of a 4-chlorophenyl group increases the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom adds a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
