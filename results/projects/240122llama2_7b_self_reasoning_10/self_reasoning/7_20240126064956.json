    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C. (2) The five chlorine atoms significantly increase the melting point due to their strong electronegativity and ability to form intermolecular dipole interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each. (3) The pyridine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
