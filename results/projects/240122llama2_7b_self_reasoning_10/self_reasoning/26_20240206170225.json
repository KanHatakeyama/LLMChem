    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point influenced by its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The phenyl group, when considering its effect, should not be underestimated. The additional piperidine ring (C1CCCC1) and 4-phenylbenzoate group can contribute to the melting point. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The phenyl group, when considering its effect, should not be underestimated. The additional piperidine ring (C1CCCC1) and 4-phenylbenzoate group can contribute to the melting point.
