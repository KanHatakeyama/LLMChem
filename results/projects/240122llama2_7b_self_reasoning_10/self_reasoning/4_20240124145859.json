    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (tepa) has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The methylene bridge (-CH2-) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The nitro group (NO2) raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. The methoxy group (O-CH3) adds approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The presence of two methyl groups (\u2013CH3) can contribute approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The carbamate group (N-methyl) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The piperidine ring (N1CC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may each add roughly +20 due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact.",
