    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups (C1CCCCC1) increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The ethyl group (C1CCCCC1) adds approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular volume and the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding; (3) The butyl group (C(C)C) adds approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular volume and the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
