    "Reason": "1,1'-Spiro-2-benzopyran has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is 1,1'-benzopyran, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in Spiroperone will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
