    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a sulfonyl group, a methoxy group, and a nitro group. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
