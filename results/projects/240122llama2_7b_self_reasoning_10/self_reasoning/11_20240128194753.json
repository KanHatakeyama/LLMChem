    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-Pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0\u00b0C. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to add approximately +10\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings.",
