    "Reason": "2,3,4-tribromothiophene has a melting point that we will compare to thiophene, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of three bromine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to the strong withdrawing groups they introduce. Each bromine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of strong dipole-dipole interactions.",
