    "Reason": "2-amino-3,5-dimethylphenyl and phenyl groups can increase the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and create a more rigid structure. The methyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to their molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding. The amino group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point. The presence of two phenyl groups can increase the melting point due to the potential for pi-pi interactions and the rigidity they bring, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each phenyl group. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The amino group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
