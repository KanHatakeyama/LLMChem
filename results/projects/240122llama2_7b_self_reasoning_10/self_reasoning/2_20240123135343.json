    "Reason": "1,1,1-Trifluoroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, ethane, has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 3 fluorines) = 45 degrees Celsius.",
