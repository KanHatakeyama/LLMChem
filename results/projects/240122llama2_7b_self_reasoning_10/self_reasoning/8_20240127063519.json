    "Reason": "1,3-di-p-tolyl-2-thiourea has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a thiourea group. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The thiourea group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to additional intermolecular interactions.",
