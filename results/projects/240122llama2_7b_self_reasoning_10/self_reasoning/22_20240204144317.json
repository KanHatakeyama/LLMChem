    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be methylpropane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two bromine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms also introduce additional rigid structures, which can participate in dipole interactions, further raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius.",
