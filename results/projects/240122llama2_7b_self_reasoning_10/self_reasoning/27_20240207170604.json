    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigidity, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The piperazine ring introduces additional rigidity, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.
