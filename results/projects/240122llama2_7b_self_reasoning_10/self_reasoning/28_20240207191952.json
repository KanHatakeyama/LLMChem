    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20. The oxo-functionalities and methylene-linked glycol structure can add roughly +30 each, and the moramide group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. The methylene-linked glycol structure can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10. The presence of a carbonyl group can also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10.",
