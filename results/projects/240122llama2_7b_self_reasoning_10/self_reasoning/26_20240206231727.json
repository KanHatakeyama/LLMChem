    "Reason": "2,6-dibromotoluene has a melting point that we can compare to toluene, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be toluene, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
