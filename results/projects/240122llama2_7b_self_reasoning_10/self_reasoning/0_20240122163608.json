    "Reason": "The compound hydrazinecarboxamide, n-phenyl- contains a basic unit of hydrazine, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of a phenyl group can increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In this case, the phenyl group can contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the carboxamide group can also increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The overall effect of these functional groups on the melting point can be estimated by adding their individual contributions.",
