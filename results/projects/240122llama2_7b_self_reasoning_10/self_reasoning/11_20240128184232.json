    "Reason": "4-decylphenyl and methyl substitutions generally lower the melting point compared to a phenyl group, as they reduce the crystal lattice stability and increase the molecular weight. Each decyl group can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to reduced crystal lattice stability and increased molecular weight. The methyl group also contributes to a slight decrease in melting point due to its smaller size and reduced molecular weight.",
