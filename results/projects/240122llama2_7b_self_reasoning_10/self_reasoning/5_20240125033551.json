    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene (cis) has a melting point of around -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the chlorine atoms also increase the electronegativity and polarizability, which can lead to stronger intermolecular interactions and a higher melting point. The net effect should be a significant increase due to both molecular size and polar interactions.",
