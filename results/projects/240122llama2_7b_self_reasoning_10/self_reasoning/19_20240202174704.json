    "Reason": "4-Nhac-2266-tetrame-piperidin-n-oxide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. Starting with the basic unit of piperidine, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of four methoxy groups can raise the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methoxy group might add approximately +5 to +10\u00b0C. Additionally, the piperidine ring formation introduces more rigidity, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The oxo group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The presence of four carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the methoxy groups and piperidine ring formation will increase the melting point more significantly than the carbonyl groups due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
