    "Reason": "2-Amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of a fluorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The pyridine ring introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
