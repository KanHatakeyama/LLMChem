    "Reason": "1,3-propanedithiol has a melting point of -105.0 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom in the molecule can form strong hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules, which can increase the melting point. The sulfur atom also has a higher electronegativity than carbon, which can increase the intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions and further increase the melting point.",
