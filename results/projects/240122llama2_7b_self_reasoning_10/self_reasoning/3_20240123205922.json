    "Reason": "1,2-Diamines have a melting point that can be estimated by considering the melting point of ethylenediamine (EDA), which has a melting point of -11.4\u00b0C. The presence of two amino groups (NH2) in N,N'-Bis(2-aminoethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine increases the molecular weight and rigidity, which generally raises the melting point. Each amino group can contribute approximately +10 to +20\u00b0C due to the additional hydrogen bonding potential and molecular weight. The two amino groups in N,N'-Bis(2-aminoethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine can thus contribute approximately +20 to +40\u00b0C.",
