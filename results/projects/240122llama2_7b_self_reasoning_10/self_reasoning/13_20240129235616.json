    "Reason": "2-Amino-pyridine base, with a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring itself contributes to a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methylamino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The naphthalene ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight.",
