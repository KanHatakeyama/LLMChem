    "Reason": "5-chloro-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The introduction of the chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the nitro group, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also increases the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the nitro group, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
