    "Reason": "2-Aminopropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an amino group (\u2013NH2) increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
