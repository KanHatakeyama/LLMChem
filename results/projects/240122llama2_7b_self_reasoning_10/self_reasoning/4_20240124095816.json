    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point of 116.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is piperazine, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an ethyl group can lower the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -5 to -10 degrees Celsius.",
