    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group raises the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxy group, let's say it increases it by +10 degrees Celsius due to the additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. The carbamate group might raise it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight.",
