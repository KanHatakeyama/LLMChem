    "Reason": "3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl groups introduce a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
