    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a tert-butyl group (C(C)C) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the chlorine within the dichloro group (C(=O)Cl) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, which raises the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity. The net effect is a significant increase in the melting point.",
