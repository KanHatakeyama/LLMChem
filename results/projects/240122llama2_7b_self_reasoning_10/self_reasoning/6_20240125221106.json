    "Reason": "1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of four chlorine atoms significantly increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +40 degrees Celsius. However, the tert-butyl group (C(C)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
