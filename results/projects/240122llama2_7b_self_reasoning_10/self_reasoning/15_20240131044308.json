    "Reason": "4-decylphenyl and methylbenzamide functionalities contribute to the melting point: The decylphenyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. The methylbenzamide moiety introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +30 \u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +40 \u00b0C per group, totaling +80 \u00b0C.",
