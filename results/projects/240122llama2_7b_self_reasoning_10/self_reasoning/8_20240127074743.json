    "Reason": "1-(2-nitro),2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The two phenyl groups in the dibenzoyl moiety add approximately +30\u00b0C each due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. The tert-butyl group introduces a rigid structure, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The dibenzoyl group introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight.",
