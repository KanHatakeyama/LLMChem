    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison can be barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in 5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid will affect its melting point: (1) The two additional phenyl groups (C1CCCC1) add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The ethyl group (C1CCCC1) adds approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular volume and reducing the symmetry; (3) The butyl group (C1CCCC1) adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
