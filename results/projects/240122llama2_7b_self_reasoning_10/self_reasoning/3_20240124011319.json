    "Reason": "1-Isouron has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is caffeine, which has a melting point of 238 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications in 1-isouron include a methyl group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the isouron group itself can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The methyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further raise the melting point.",
