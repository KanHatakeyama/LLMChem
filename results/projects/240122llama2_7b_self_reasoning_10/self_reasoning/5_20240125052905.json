    "Reason": "1,3-Isouron has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 1,3-propanediol, which has a melting point of approximately 50 degrees Celsius. (2) The methoxy group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. (3) The carbamate group (N(C)C) creates additional hydrogen bonding opportunities, increasing the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. (4) The isouron ring introduces a more complex structure with potential hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius.",
