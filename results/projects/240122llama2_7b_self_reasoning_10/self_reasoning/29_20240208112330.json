    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is furfuryl, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The isopropyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The moramide group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
