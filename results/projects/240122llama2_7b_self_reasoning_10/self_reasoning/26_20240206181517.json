    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, a nitro group, and a methoxy group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature. Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each ether.",
