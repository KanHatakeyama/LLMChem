    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 30 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is biphenyl, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius due to the presence of two phenyl rings. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
