    "Reason": "1,4-dione ring with a pyridine ring linked in place of a hydrogen atom. The pyridine ring itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which enhances the crystalline structure and the molecular weight. The methylamino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
