    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl is a bulky group which can increase the melting point due to steric hindrance and rigidity. Each morpholinyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the nitro group introduces a dipole moment, which can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +20 each, due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
