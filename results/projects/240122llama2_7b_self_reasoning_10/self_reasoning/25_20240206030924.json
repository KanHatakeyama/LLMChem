    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The xanthene structure introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the xanthene structure has two methoxy groups, which can raise the melting point by approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
