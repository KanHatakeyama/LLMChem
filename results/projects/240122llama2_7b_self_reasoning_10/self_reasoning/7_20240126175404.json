    "Reason": "1,1-Dimethylacetamide has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is acetamide, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups in 1,1-dimethylacetamide increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each methyl group is estimated to add approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
