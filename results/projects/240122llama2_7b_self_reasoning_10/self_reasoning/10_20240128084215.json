    "Reason": "3-chlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities significantly increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The trifluoromethyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
