    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. Furane ring formation increases the melting point due to the rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methoxy group can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
