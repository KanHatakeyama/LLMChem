    "Reason": "2-Amino-3,5-dimethylphenyl and phenyl groups can contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The methyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to increase the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, approximately +10\u00b0C each. The amino group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
