    "Reason": "1-Propyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to the basic unit of acetate, which has a melting point of -119.0 degrees Celsius. The additional methyl group introduces more molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the propyl group also introduces more hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in acetate, the additional methyl group allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methyl group into consideration, we can predict a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
