    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point around 10\u00b0C. The introduction of the octyl group (C1CCCCCC1) increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The amine group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: +20\u00b0C for the octyl group and -10\u00b0C for the amine group.",
