    "Reason": "2-vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a vinyl group, which introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the carboxylic acid group can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C. The vinyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C.",
