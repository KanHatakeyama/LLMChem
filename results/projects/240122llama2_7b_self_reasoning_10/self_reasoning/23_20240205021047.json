    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional pi-system and rigidity. The tetrahydro-functionality also contributes to a more rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
