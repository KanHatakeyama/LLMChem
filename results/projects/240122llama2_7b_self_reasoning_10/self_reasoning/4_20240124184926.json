    "Reason": "1,3-dicyanopropane has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The cyano group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The acetamide group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two cyano groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
