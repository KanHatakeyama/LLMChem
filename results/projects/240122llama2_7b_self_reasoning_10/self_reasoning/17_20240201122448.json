    "Reason": "5-(4-morpholinyl)-2-nitrophenol has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is 2-nitrophenol, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group that increases intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Morpholinyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The nitro group also introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
