    "Reason": "4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone has a basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The functional groups present in this molecule include a hydroxyl group, a methoxy group, and a carbonyl group. The hydroxyl group can increase the melting point by around +5\u00b0C due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point by around +5\u00b0C due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The carbonyl group can form hydrogen bonds and contribute around +20\u00b0C to the melting point.",
