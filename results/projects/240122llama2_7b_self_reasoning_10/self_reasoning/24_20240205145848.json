    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups and a methoxy group increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The two additional phenyl groups increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
