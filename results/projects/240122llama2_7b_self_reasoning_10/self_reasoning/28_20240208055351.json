    "Reason": "1-propene, 1-chloro-, (z)- has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be 1-propene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atom raises the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
