    "Reason": "1,3,5-trisubstituted phosphates have a melting point influenced by the presence of three butyl groups, which increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, resulting in an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The phosphate group itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C.",
