    "Reason": "1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-Octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane has a melting point that we will compare to that of butane, which has a melting point of -11.2\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms in the molecule increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Each fluorine atom can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The iodine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
