    "Reason": "1-chlorine substitution generally increases the melting point compared to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The additional molecular weight and electronegativity also contribute to a higher melting point.",
