    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a rigid structure with a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius. The nitro group also introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group can raise the melting point by +2 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
