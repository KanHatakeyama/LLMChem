    "Reason": "4-decylphenyl and methylbenzamide functionalities significantly impact the melting point. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, a decyl group, and a methyl group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The decyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion can significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
