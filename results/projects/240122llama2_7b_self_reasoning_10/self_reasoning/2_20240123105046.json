    "Reason": "4-fluorophenyl and trifluoromethyl groups are known to increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and rigidity. The fluorine atoms also increase the molecular weight and polarizability, which can contribute to a higher melting point. The piperidine ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight. The dihydroxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to its hydrogen bonding potential.",
