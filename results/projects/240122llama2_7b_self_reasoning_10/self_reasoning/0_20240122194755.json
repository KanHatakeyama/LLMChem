    "Reason": "2-Ethyloxirane has a melting point of -11.4\u00b0C according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969. The ethyl group is a nonpolar, hydrophobic group that can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a nonpolar, hydrophobic group. The oxirane ring is a polar, ring-containing group that can also contribute to the melting point through pi-pi interactions. The combination of these two groups can increase the melting point by approximately 20-30 degrees Celsius.",
