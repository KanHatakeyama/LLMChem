    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of three butyl groups (CCCC) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the phosphate group (PO4) introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The butyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius each.",
