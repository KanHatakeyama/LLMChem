    "Reason": "4-bromodiphenyl ether has a melting point that we can compare to the melting point of diphenyl ether, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The additional phenyl group also contributes to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
