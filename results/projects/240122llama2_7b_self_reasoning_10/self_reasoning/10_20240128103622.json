    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which increases the molecular weight and size, and also introduces hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The octyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups also increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
