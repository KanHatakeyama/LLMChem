    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The introduction of a methoxy group generally raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, the presence of two carbonyl groups also increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each. The 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), one methoxy group (+10\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C).",
