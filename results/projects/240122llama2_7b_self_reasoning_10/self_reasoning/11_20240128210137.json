    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The iodine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and the formation of iodine-containing compounds, which have a higher melting point than hydrogen-bonded compounds. The iodine atom can participate in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
