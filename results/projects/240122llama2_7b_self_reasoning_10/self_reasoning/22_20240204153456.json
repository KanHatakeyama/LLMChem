    "Reason": "1,1-Thiobarbituric acid has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be barbituric acid, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the carboxymethyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The amino group also introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups and the additional hydrogen bonding potential increase the melting point.",
