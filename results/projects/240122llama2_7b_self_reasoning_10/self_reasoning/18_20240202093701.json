    "Reason": "1-benzyl-3-phenyl-2-(phenylhydrazono)propylidene and phenylhydrazine functionalities significantly impact the melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of the phenyl group and the propylidene chain increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-stacking interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +30 \u00b0C. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The propylidene chain introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C.",
