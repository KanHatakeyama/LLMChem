    "Reason": "2-vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The presence of a vinyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydroxyl group, which raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, approximately +5\u00b0C. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C.",
