    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for this compound is a diamide, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. 2. The presence of a phenyl group can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. 3. The chlorine atom can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +5\u00b0C. 4. The imidic acid group can also contribute to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
