    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenyl can increase the melting point due to the additional pi-system and rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 \u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 \u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydroxyl group.",
