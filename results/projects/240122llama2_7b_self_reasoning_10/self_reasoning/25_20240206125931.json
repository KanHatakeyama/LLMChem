    "Reason": "1-Nitro-functionality introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. Two phenyl groups, while not as rigid as a piperazine ring, are still expected to contribute to the melting point due to their molecular weight and the presence of two phenyl groups, which would notably increase the melting point. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can sterically hinder the crystal lattice, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for two phenyl groups, we have +40\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +20\u00b0C, the tert-butyl group at +10\u00b0C, and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +70\u00b0C.",
