    "Reason": "1,2,3-Trimethyl-1,3-butadiene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered ethylene (with a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C) because the cyclobutane ring formation will significantly alter the physical properties compared to a straight-chain butene isomer. For the methylene-cyclobutane specifically, the introduction of the four-membered ring introduces ring strain and a more rigid structure, but also reduces the symmetry. This reduction in symmetry and presence of strain usually leads to a higher melting point. However, the exact impact of ring formation is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. Ring formation: +35\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
