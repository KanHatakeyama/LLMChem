    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20\u00b0C each, totaling +40\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by +5\u00b0C. The phenylmethyl group introduces a bulky structure, which might raise the melting point by +5\u00b0C due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
