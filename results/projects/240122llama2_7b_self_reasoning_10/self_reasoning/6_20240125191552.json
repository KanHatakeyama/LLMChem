    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of five ethyl groups significantly increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each ethyl group is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 5 ethyl groups) = 50 degrees Celsius.",
