    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The presence of two phenyl groups also introduces additional pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each phenyl group. The hydroxylamine group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The dioxane-like bridging moiety also contributes to the melting point, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
