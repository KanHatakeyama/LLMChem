    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The acetyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The alanyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The tetracyclo[6.6.2.0~2,7~.0~9,14~]hexadeca-2,4,6,9,11,13,15-heptaene-15,16-dicarboxylate moiety introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The moramide group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
