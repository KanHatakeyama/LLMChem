    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The methyl group introduces a slight increase due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and electronegativity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
