    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each bromine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
