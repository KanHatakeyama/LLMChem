    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol has a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of a phenylmethyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The phenyl group itself can contribute around +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of pi-pi interactions. The methyl group can also contribute around +5 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonding.",
