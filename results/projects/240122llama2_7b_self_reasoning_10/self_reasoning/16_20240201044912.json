    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a 2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional functional group and the resulting molecular weight increase. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
