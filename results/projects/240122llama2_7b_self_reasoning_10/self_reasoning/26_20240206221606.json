    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanal (with a melting point of -119.6\u00b0C) because the dioxane ring formation will significantly alter the physical properties compared to a straight-chain butene isomer. For the methoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
