    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. Each additional fused aromatic ring adds approximately +25 \u00b0C due to pi-stacking interactions and increased molecular rigidity. The thiosemicarbazide moiety introduces a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The benzyl group adds approximately +20 \u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a rigid, planar structure.",
