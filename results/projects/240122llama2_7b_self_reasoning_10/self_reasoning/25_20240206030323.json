    "Reason": "1-methylcyclohexane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom reduces the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which might lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. However, the methyl group also increases the molecular volume due to its rigidity, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
