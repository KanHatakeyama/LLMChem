    "Reason": "2-Ethyloxirane has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius per group, totaling +40 degrees Celsius. The oxirane ring introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduction in molecular weight and the absence of a hydrogen bonding potential, approximately -10 degrees Celsius.",
