    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl is a bulky group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the additional rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential. Each morpholinyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The nitro group also introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups also contributes to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each.",
