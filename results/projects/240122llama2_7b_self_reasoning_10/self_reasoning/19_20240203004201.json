    "Reason": "1-Pyrrolidinyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, which raises the melting point. The pyrrolidinyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The effects are additive.",
