    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a melting point of -95 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The dimethylamino group introduces two additional amino functionalities, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces a rigid structure and reduces the symmetry, which can contribute to a higher melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
