    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The azide group introduces a nitrogen atom with a high electronegativity, which raises the melting point due to increased molecular polarity. The sulfur atom within the sulfonyl group also introduces additional rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact.",
