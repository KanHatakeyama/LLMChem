    "Reason": "1-propanol has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an isopropyl group (\u2013CH(CH3)2) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in 1-propanol, the additional methyl group allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methyl group into consideration, we can predict a decreased melting point due to the additional hydrogen bonding.",
