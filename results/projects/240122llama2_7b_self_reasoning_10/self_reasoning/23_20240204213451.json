    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl group: The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Phenyl group: The two phenyl rings can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
