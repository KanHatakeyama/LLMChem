The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.
