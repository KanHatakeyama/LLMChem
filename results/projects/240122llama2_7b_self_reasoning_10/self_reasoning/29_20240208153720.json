    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups add approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The trimethyl group (C(C)C) adds rigidity, contributing approximately +10. The bicyclic system introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by about +30. The carboxyl group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
