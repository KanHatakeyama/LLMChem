    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
