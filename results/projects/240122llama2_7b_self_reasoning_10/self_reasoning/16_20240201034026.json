    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexylamino-chromen-2-one has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-phenyl-2-propanone, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The cyclohexylamino group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The cyclohexane ring itself contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
