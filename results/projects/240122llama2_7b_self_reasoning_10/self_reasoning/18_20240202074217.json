    "Reason": "1,3,4-Thiadiazole ring: The presence of a 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group also increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
