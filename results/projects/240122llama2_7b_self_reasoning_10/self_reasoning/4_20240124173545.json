    "Reason": "1,3-Butanediol has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a hexyl group (C6H13) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the additional functional group introduces more rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
