    "Reason": "4-{(2E)-3-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]prop-2-enoyl}phenyl has a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a phenyl group, which increases the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. The dimethylamino group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can raise it by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
