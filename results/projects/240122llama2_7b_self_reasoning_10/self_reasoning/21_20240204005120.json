    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each phenyl group. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The ether linkage introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +2 \u00b0C. The dioxane-like bridging moiety introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
