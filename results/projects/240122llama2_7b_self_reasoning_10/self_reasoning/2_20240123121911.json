    "Reason": "1,12-diaminododecane has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit of analysis is the dodecane moiety, which has a melting point of around 50\u00b0C due to its molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The diamine functional group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two amine groups can also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
