    "Reason": "The compound imidodicarbonimidic diamide, n-(4-chlorophenyl)- contains a basic aromatic system (phenyl) and a nitrogen atom, which can influence its melting point. Starting with the melting point of benzene (5.5\u00b0C), we need to consider the structural components:\n\n* Phenyl group: The presence of a phenyl group can increase the melting point due to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and molecular rigidity. This effect is estimated to add around +30 to +50\u00b0C.\n* Nitrogen atom: The nitrogen atom can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can contribute to the melting point. The estimated effect is around +10 to +20\u00b0C.\n* Chlorine atom: The chlorine atom can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The estimated effect is around +5 to +10\u00b0C.\n\nSumming up these contributions, we get: +45 to +70\u00b0C for the phenyl group, +10 to +20\u00b0C for the nitrogen atom, and +5 to +10\u00b0C for the chlorine atom.",
