    "Reason": "4-bromodiphenyl ether is a compound with a phenyl group and a bromine atom. The melting point of this compound can be predicted by considering the melting point of the basic unit, which is the phenyl group. The phenyl group has a melting point of around 5.5\u00b0C. The bromine atom will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a halogen atom, which can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules. The bromine atom will increase the melting point by around +30\u00b0C.",
