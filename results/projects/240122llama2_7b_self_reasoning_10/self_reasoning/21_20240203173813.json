    "Reason": "2-Amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The introduction of the fluorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The amino group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings.",
