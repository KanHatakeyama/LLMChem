    "Reason": "4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethylbenzene, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the methyl groups introduce additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C each. The ethyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
