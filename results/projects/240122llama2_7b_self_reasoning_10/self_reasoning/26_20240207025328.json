    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and decreased molecular weight, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
