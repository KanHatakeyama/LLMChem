    "Reason": "1,1'-biphenyl-2,5-diol has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups and a diol group can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The diol group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20. Additionally, the acetate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +10.",
