    "Reason": "Digitoxose is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups that can impact its melting point. Starting with the base unit of glycerol (melting point of -12.2\u00b0C), we have several structural components to consider. The basic unit can be considered as a glycerol backbone, which has a melting point of -12.2\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point, albeit to a lesser extent, at around +5\u00b0C. The hydroxymethyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which may slightly increase the melting point. The carbonyl group can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase molecular weight. The nitro group can also contribute to the melting point due to its strong dipole moment, which can increase intermolecular forces. The presence of a nitro group can raise the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The overall effect of these functional groups is additive, and their contributions can be estimated based on their individual melting point increases.",
