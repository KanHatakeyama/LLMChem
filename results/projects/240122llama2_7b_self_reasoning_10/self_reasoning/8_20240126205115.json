    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The cyclohexene group itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid and anhydride functionalities introduce additional rigid structures and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C each. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each.",
