    "Reason": "1,1,2,3-Tetramethylpyrazine has a melting point that we can compare to pyrazine, which has a melting point of -15.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be pyrazine. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of four additional methyl groups. Methyl groups, when connected to a pyrazine ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 1,1,2,3-tetramethylpyrazine, we have four additional methyl groups linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional methyl group can be estimated to add approximately 10\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
