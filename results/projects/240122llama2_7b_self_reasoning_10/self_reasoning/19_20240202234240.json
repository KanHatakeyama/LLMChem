    "Reason": "9-bromofluorene has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) Two phenyl groups, which add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the formation of a bromine-containing compound, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +10. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
