    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the dioxane-like bridging moiety can contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
