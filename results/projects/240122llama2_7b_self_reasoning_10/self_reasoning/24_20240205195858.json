    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional pi-system and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
