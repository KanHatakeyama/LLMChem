    "Reason": "3-methylquinoline n-oxide has a melting point that we can compare to quinine, which has a melting point of 106.5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The nitrogen within the quinone ring also introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C.",
