    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with two additional phenyl groups, which would add approximately +30 to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and volume, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The naphthalene ring itself has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two fused aromatic rings, which increase the melting point through rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
