    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,5-difluorobenzoic acid has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the fluorine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. The difluorobenzoic acid moiety also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight.",
