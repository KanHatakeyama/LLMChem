    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is biphenyl, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The acetyl group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius per group, totaling +40 degrees Celsius.",
