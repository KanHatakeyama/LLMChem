    "Reason": "1,2-furanyl groups are known to increase the melting point due to their rigidity and ability to enhance pi-pi interactions. Each furanyl group may add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the dioxime group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10.",
