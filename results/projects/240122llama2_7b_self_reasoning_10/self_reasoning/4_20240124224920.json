    "Reason": "16-methyl-17-oxoandrost-5-en-3-yl acetate has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is androstane, which has a melting point of 106.5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The oxo group (\u2013O\u2013) raises the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and potential hydrogen bonding. The acetate group (\u2013CO\u2013) adds approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The presence of two fused aromatic rings increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at approximately +25 degrees Celsius for each additional fused ring. The methyl group also increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
