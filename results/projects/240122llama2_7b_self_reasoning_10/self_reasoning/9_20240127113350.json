    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. Anthrone has a melting point that is significantly higher due to the presence of two fused aromatic rings, which increases the melting point due to pi-pi interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each additional phenyl group can add approximately +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the ketone group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C.",
