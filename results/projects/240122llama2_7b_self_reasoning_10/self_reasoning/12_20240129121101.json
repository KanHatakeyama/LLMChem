    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The dimethoxy group introduces additional rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The acetyl group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.
