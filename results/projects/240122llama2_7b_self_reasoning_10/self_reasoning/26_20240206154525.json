    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20. The methylene-phenyl linkage might raise the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; The moramide group includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. The oxo group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10. The carbamate group raises the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
