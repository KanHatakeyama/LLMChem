    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is methane, which has a melting point of -161.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a bromine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the dioxane ring, which raises it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
