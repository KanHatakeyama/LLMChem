    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The compound under consideration has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
