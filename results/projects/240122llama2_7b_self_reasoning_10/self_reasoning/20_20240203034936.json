    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethylbenzene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
