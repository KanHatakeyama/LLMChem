    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. However, the presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
