    "Reason": "1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the Incasan base has a more complex structure with multiple functional groups, including a methoxy group, a nitro group, and a carbonyl. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The nitro group raises the melting point due to the dipole moment, estimated at around +50\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.
