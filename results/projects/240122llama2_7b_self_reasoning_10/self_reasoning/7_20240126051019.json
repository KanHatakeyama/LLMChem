    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The fluorine atoms also increase the electronegativity, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular polarity. The net effect is a significant increase due to both factors.",
