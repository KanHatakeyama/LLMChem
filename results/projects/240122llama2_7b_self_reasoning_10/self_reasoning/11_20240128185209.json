    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the chlorine atoms can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
