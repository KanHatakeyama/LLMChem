    "Reason": "4-chlorophenyl group: The 4-chlorophenyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The piperidine base itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C.",
