    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbamate linkage: The carbamate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carbamate group can also enhance the crystalline structure, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
