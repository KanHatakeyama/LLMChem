    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The chlorine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C each. The pyridine ring introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
