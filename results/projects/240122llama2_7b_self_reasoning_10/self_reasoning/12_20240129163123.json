    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of succinic acid (melting point of 120 degrees Celsius). The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each bromine is estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the carboxyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius each due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
