    "Reason": "3-pentanol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methyl group, let's say it raises it by +5 degrees Celsius due to increasing the molecular weight and volume. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
