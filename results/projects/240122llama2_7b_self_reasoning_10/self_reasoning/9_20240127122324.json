    "Reason": "4-chlorophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a chlorine atom. Chlorine is a strong electronegative atom that can form hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules, which can increase the melting point. The chlorine atom can also participate in dipole interactions, which can further increase the melting point. The 4-hydroxypiperidine base has a melting point around 106\u00b0C, due to the presence of a piperidine ring and the hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atom can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to the presence of a chlorine atom, which can participate in dipole interactions.",
