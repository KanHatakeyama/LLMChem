    "Reason": "1,1'-Thiabenzene base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the thiabenzene base itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C.",
