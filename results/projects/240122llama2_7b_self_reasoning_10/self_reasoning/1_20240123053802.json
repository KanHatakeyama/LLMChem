    "Reason": "1-propene has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The introduction of a chlorine atom can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding with the propene chain. The chlorine atom also creates a dipole moment, which can increase the molecular polarity and potentially lower the melting point. However, the exact impact of the chlorine atom is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
