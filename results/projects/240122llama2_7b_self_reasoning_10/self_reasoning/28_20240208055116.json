    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
