    "Reason": "4-Benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide is a compound with a complex structure, containing a benzene ring, a thiosemicarbazide group, and a nitrogen atom. The thiosemicarbazide group is known to increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can lead to a higher melting point. The benzene ring also contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and rigidity. The nitrogen atom can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also contribute to the melting point. However, the presence of the benzyl group can lower the melting point due to its steric hindrance and reduced ability to form hydrogen bonds. The overall effect of these functional groups on the melting point can be estimated by considering their individual contributions and adding them up.",
