    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and electronegativity, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the alcohol group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
