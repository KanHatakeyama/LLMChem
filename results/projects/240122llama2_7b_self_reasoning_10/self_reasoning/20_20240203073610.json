    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional fluorine atoms, which significantly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure. Each additional fluorine atom can be estimated to add approximately +10 to +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure.",
