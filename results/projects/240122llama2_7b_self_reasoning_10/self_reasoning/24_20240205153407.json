    "Reason": "4-Morpholinylmethyl is a functional group that can significantly impact the melting point of a compound. Morpholine itself has a melting point of around -106\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the melting point of benzene. The presence of four morpholine rings can increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional morpholine ring can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
