    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in embelin will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The methoxy group (Oc1ccccc1O) introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
