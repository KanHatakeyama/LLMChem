    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl is a bulky group which introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight. Each morpholinyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 to +30\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The nitro group also introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
