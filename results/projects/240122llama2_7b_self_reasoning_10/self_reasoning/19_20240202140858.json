    "Reason": "1-methyl-4-nitronaphthalene has a melting point that we can compare to naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is naphthalene, which has a melting point around 95\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group can lower the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding potential. The nitro group can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The exact impact of these functional groups depends on their specific effect on the molecular structure and the degree to which they are present.",
