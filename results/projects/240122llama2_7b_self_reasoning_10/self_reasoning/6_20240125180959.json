    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group and a hydroquinone moiety. The phenyl group can increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The hydroquinone moiety can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can rigidify the structure and increase the melting point. The exact contribution of the phenyl group and hydroquinone moiety can be estimated as follows: Phenyl group: +30\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications). Hydroquinone moiety: +20\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
