    "Reason": "1,2,3-Trinitro compounds have a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to benzene's melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is p-nitrobenzene, which has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups raises the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
