    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with four methoxy groups, which add approximately +10\u00b0C each due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The presence of a dioxane-like bridging moiety also contributes to the melting point, estimated at around +5\u00b0C for this structural feature.",
