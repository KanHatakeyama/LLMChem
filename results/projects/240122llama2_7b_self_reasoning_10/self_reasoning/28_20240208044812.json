    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with two additional phenyl rings, which would add approximately +20\u00b0C for each additional phenyl group due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydroxyl group. The dimethyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydroxyl group. The 3-phenyl-1-propanol moiety adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The 1-methyl-1H-2,3-benzodiazepine moiety adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
