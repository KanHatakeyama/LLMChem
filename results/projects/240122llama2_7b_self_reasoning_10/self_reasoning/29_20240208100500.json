    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The methoxy groups (two in total) increase the melting point due to additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. Each methoxy group might raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group also contributes to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
