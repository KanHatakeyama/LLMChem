    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 2-methylpropane, which has a melting point of -10.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of a rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
