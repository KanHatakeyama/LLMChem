    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, a nitro group, and two dinitro groups. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The two dinitro groups also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of two additional nitrogen atoms, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each. Additionally, the amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
