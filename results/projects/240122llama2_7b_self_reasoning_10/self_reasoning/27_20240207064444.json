    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point influenced by its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
