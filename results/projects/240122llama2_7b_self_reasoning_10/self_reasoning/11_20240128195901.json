    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyethyl)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be 1,1-propanediol, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a propanediol base, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of bis(methoxyethyl)phthalate, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
