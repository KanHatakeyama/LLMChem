    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methoxy group can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
