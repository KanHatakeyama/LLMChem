    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of a 4-chlorophenyl group will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, which raises the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
