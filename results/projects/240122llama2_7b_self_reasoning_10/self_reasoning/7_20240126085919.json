    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-nitrobenzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of three methyl groups and a nitro group can significantly alter the melting point. The methyl groups add approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
