    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl is a bulky group which would add rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +20. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the morpholinyl base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxy group, let's say it increases it by +2 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
