    "Reason": "4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethylbenzene, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene will affect its melting point: (1) Two methyl groups can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. (2) The ethyl group introduces a slight increase due to the additional rigid structure, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. (3) The methylene bridge introduces a slight increase due to the additional rigid structure, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius.",
