    "Reason": "3-(boc-amino)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group, which introduces a hydrogen bonding potential and a slight increase in molecular weight. Additionally, the amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group can also increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
