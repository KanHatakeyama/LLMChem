    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in sulfur dioxide will affect its melting point: (1) The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. (2) The dioxide functional group (O=S=O) creates a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
