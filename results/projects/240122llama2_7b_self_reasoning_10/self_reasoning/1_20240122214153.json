    "Reason": "Xanthene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is anthracene, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The presence of additional fused rings increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each additional fused ring can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
