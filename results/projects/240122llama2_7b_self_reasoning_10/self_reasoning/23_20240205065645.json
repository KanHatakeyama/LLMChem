    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is the fluorinated ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a bromine atom increases the melting point due to the formation of a rigid structure and the presence of a halogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
