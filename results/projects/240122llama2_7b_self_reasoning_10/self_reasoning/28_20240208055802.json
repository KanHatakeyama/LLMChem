    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-imidazolidine has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered 1,3,5-trimethyl-2-imidazolidine, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of three methyl groups reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each methyl group might reduce the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the phosphate group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
