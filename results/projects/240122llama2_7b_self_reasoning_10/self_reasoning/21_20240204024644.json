    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C).",
