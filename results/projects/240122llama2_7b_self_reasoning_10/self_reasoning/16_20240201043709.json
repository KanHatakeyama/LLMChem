    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The methylphenyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius. The amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +2 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius each.",
