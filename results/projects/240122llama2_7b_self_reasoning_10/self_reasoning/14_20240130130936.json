    "Reason": "1,1'-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of pregn-5-en-20-yne-3,17-diol, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the presence of a methoxy group can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The ether linkage can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
