    "Reason": "1,2-thiolactones have a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a lactone ring, which enhances the molecular rigidity and pi-pi interactions. The basic unit for this compound is acetylhomocysteine, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The thiolactone ring introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom also contributes to the melting point due to its high electronegativity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
