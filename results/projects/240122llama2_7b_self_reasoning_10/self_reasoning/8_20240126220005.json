    "Reason": "Voriconazole has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point. Starting with the basic unit of 1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione (melting point around 106\u00b0C), we have substantial structural components to consider: (1) The piperazine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. (2) The two carbonyl groups in voriconazole increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C each. (3) The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. (4) The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at approximately +5\u00b0C. (5) The nitrogen atom introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. (6) The sulfur atom introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. (7) The two methyl groups add approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
