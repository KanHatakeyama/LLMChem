    "Reason": "1-oxoindane has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid group introduces a carboxylate ion, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The oxo group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
