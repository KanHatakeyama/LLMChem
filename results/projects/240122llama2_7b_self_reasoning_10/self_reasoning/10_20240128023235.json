    "Reason": "1-methyl-4-nitronaphthalene has a melting point that we can compare to naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methyl group can lower the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding potential. The nitro group can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The net effect should be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
