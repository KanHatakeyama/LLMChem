    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius.",
