    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The two carbonyl groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20\u00b0C each. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
