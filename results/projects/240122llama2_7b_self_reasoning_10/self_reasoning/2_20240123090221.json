    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclopentane has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit of analysis is cyclopentane, which has a melting point of 10.0 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atoms increase the melting point due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase molecular weight. Each chlorine atom can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius to the melting point.",
