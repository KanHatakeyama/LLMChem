    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The phenyl group, when considering its effect, should not be underestimated. Two phenyl groups, when connected, add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the indole ring introduces pi-pi interactions, which can contribute to the melting point. The indole ring itself can be estimated at around +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.
