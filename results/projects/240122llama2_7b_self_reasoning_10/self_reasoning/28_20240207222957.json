    "Reason": "5-Butyl and 5-ethyl substitutions tend to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as they create a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The butyl group also reduces the melting point due to the increased molecular volume and rigidity, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
