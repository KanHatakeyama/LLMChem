    "Reason": "2-Phenylpropanoic acid has a melting point of 120.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) in the molecule can also contribute to hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) can also contribute to the molecular weight and rigidity, which can increase the melting point. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact.",
