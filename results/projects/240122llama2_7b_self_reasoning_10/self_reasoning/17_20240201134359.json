    "Reason": "2-Aminopropane has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit of analysis is propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The amino group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
