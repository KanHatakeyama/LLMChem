    "Reason": "5-tert-butyl-2-methyl-3-furoic acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is furan, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The tert-butyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group introduces a small increase due to the additional electronegativity. The carbonyl group introduces a significant increase due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and the rigid structure it creates. The furoic acid moiety introduces a significant increase due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and form a rigid structure. The tert-butyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group can add approximately +5\u00b0C due to the additional electronegativity. The carbonyl group can add approximately +20\u00b0C due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and the rigid structure it creates. The furoic acid moiety can add approximately +20\u00b0C due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and form a rigid structure.",
