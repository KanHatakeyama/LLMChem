    "Reason": "2-pyridineacetamide has a melting point of 120.5 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring is a rigid structure that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point. The acetamide group is a polar functional group that can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which also increases the melting point. The presence of both the pyridine ring and the acetamide group increases the molecular weight and size, which also raises the melting point.",
