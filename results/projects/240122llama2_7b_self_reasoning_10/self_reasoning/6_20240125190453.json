    "Reason": "3-methyl-butyraldehyde oxime has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The oxime group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The aldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
