    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius, is the starting point for our analysis. The presence of a benzene ring introduces rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, which can contribute to the melting point. The methoxy groups (two in total) increase the melting point due to additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The acetyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The hydroxyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The methoxy groups and hydroxyl group each add approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The acetyl group and benzyl group each add approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
