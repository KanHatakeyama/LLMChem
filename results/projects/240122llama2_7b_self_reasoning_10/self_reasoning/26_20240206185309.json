    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The butyl group also introduces a more rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
