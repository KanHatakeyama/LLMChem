    "Reason": "4-ethoxyphenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities significantly impact the melting point. The ethoxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups in N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide will affect its melting point: (1) The ethoxy group introduces hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius. (2) The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. (3) The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, estimated at approximately +40 degrees Celsius.",
