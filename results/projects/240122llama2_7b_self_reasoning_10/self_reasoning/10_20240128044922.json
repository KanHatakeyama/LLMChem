    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (benzene melting point: 5.5\u00b0C) with four phenyl groups, which significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The nitrogen atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a strong hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The phenyl groups contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.
