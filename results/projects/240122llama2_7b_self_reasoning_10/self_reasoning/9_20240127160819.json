    "Reason": "1,1'-Physostigmine has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is chloroform, which has a melting point of -11.6 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two fused aromatic rings and a methoxy group increases the molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at approximately +25 degrees Celsius for each additional fused ring and +5 degrees Celsius for the methoxy group. Additionally, the molecular structure includes a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius for this structural feature. (2) The presence of a nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. (3) The phosphate group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. (4) The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
