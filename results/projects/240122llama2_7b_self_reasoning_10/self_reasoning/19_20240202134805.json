    "Reason": "6-Nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a nitro group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. Two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
