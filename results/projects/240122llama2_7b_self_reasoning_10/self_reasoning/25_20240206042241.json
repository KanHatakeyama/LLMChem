    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of aniline, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The aniline ring itself contributes to the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group also introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius.",
