    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups increase the melting point due to their effect on the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each methyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the cis-configuration in the molecular structure can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular rigidity. The cis-configuration can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
