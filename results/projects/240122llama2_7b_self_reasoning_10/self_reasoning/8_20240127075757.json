    "Reason": "3-(boc-amino)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxyphenyl group, a propionic acid group, and a basic amino group. The methoxyphenyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi interactions. The propionic acid group introduces a carboxylate group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The basic amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
