    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the imidazole ring, which has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a rigid ring structure with a melting point-raising potential. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20. The imidazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10. The phenyl group also introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20.",
