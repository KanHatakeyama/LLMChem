    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl acetonitrile has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of acetonitrile, which is around -10\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The acetonitrile group itself does not significantly impact the melting point but can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may slightly raise it.",
