    "Reason": "1,3,4-Oxadiazole ring: The oxadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. Naphthyl groups: The two naphthyl rings can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each naphthyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
