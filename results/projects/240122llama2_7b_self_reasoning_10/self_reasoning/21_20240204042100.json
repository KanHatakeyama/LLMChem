    "Reason": "1-Nitro-functionality introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular interactions and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Two phenyl groups, while not as rigid as a piperazine ring, are still expected to contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the tert-butyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can add approximately +10\u00b0C due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The dibenzoyl group introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular volume.",
