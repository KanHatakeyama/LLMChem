    "Reason": "1,2-dihydroacenaphthylen-5-yl and phenyl groups both add rigidity and molecular weight, with an estimated increase of +20\u00b0C due to the additional phenyl group and +10\u00b0C due to the 1,2-dihydroacenaphthylen-5-yl group. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The quinoxaline base itself has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a planar, aromatic system with a high melting point. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5\u00b0C.",
