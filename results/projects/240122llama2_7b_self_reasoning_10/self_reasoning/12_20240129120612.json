    "Reason": "1-phenylcyclohexanol has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit we can compare to is cyclohexanol, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1-phenylcyclohexanol will affect its melting point: (1) The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 due to the increase in molecular volume and van der Waals interactions; (2) The cyclohexane ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +30 due to the increase in molecular volume and van der Waals interactions; (3) The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
