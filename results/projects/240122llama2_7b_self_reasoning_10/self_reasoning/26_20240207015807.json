    "Reason": "4-bromodiphenyl ether has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is diphenyl ether, which has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to the presence of two phenyl groups. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The ether linkage also contributes to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the phenyl groups, estimated at around +2\u00b0C.",
