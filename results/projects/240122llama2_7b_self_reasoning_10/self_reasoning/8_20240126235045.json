    "Reason": "1,1,2,3-Tetramethylpyrazine has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of four methyl groups, which increase the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C each. Additionally, the pyrazine ring introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
