    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C due to the presence of a methyl group, which increases the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, but also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group can contribute approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The n-octyl group (CCCCCCCCCC) adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
