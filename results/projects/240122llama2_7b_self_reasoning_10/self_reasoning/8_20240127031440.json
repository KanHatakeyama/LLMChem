    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in N,N-dibenzylhydroxylamine will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The methoxy group (O-C(=O)O) adds approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces; (3) The hydroxylamine group (N-hydroxylamine) adds approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
