    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexylamino-chromen-2-one has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The cyclohexylamino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The chromene moiety introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +60\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +60\u00b0C.",
