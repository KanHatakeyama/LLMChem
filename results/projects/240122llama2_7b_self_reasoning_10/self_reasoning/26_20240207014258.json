    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the stilbene ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The nitro group also increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight.",
