    "Reason": "1,3-Butadiene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a tert-butyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the acrylate group (\u2013CO\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The tert-butyl group also enhances the molecular rigidity due to its bulky size. The net effect should be a significant increase in melting point due to the combination of molecular size, hydrogen bonding, and rigidity.",
