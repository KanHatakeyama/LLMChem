    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The introduction of two methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl groups also increase the crystalline structure's rigidity and pi-pi interactions, which can further contribute to the melting point. The net effect should be a higher melting point due to both factors.",
