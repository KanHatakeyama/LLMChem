    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl group: The nitro functional group can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. Phenyl group (2 phenyls): The two phenyls can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,3,5-thiadiazol-2-one: The methyl group can lower the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -10\u00b0C. The phenyl group can also increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The thiadiazole ring itself can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
