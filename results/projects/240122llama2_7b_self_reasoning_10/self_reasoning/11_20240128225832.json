    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 \u00b0C. The introduction of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +20 \u00b0C for each bromine atom. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at approximately +5 \u00b0C.",
