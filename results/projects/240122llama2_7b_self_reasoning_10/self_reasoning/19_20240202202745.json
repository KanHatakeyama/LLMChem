    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two fused aromatic rings, which would add approximately +25\u00b0C due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
