    "Reason": "1,3-propanedioic acid, oxo-, diethyl ester has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit we can compare to is propane, which has a melting point of -18.2 \u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in propanedioic acid, oxo-, diethyl ester will affect its melting point: (1) The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) can lower the melting point by approximately -10 \u00b0C due to the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the molecular weight; (2) The two ethyl groups (C(=O)OCC) can each add approximately +10 \u00b0C due to increasing the molecular weight and introducing steric hindrance; (3) The oxo group (O=C(=O)OCC) can add approximately +5 \u00b0C due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the molecular weight. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
