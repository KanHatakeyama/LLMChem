    "Reason": "5-chloro-2-methoxy-4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxy-4-methylbenzene, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)Cl) adds rigidity and molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
