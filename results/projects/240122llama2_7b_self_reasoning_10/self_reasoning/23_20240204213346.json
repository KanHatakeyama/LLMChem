    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may add roughly +20 due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20; The oxo-functionalities and methylene-chain introduce additional rigid structures, estimated at +30 each; The moramide group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
