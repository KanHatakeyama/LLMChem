    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The stilbene ring introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydroxyl group.",
