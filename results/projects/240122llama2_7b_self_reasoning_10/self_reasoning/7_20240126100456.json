    "Reason": "1-aspartic acid has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The carbonyl group also contributes to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The benzyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to its effect on the crystal lattice stability and the additional molecular weight. The carbonyl group can also contribute to the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions.",
