    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of eight octyl chains (C(C)C) in N-octyloctan-1-amine increases the molecular weight and rigidity, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the amine group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
