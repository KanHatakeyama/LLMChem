    "Reason": "1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of four chlorine atoms, which significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity and dipole moment. Each chlorine atom can raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
