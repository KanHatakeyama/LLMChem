    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The anthracene base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to its planar, aromatic structure with a high melting point. The nitro group's effect might be around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
