    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanol, the base compound, has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group can contribute approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the benzamide group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduction in molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding site.",
