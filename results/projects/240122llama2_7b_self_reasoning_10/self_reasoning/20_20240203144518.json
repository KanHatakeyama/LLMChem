    "Reason": "1-pyrrolidinyl substitution tends to increase the melting point compared to phenol, as it creates a more rigid structure with a higher melting point. The additional functional group introduces more rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which raises the melting point. The pyrrolidinyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which raises the melting point.
