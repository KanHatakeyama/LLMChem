    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an octyl group (C1CCCCCC1) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The amine group (NCCCCCCC) also participates in hydrogen bonding, which can further lower the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay between the increase in molecular weight and size and the hydrogen bonding potential. The exact magnitude of these effects is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the net effect as a moderate increase due to the octyl group and a more significant decrease due to the amine group.",
