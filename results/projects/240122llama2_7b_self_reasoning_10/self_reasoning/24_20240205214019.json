    "Reason": "2-bromo-3-iodo-5-methylpyridine has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The bromine atom also introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The pyridine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one methyl group, we have +10\u00b0C total (having less influence due to the complex structure), one iodine atom at +50\u00b0C, and one bromine atom at +20\u00b0C.",
