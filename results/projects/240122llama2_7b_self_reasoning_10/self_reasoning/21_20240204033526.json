    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The basic unit for comparison is 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in clobenzepam will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +30 to +50 degrees Celsius due to increasing molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 to +20 degrees Celsius due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The moramide group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives the total melting point shift.",
