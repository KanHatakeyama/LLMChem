    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a melting point that we can compare to pyrrole, which has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a phenyl group and a sulfonyl group can increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C.",
