    "Reason": "1,2-diphenyl ethane has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group can also raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
