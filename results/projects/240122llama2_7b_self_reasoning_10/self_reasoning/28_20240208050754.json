    "Reason": "1,3-Bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 3-methylbutane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the compound has two ether linkages, which would raise the melting point by approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and volume. The compound also has two hydroxyl groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the phenyl group, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius for each methoxy group due to the increase in molecular weight and volume.",
