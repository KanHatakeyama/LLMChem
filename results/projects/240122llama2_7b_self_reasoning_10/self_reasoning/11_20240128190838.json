    "Reason": "4-Morpholinylmethyl is a functional group that can significantly impact the melting point. Morpholine itself has a melting point of around -100\u00b0C due to its rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group also adds to the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C. The presence of four morpholine rings can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each morpholine ring may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
