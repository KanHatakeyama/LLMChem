    "Reason": "1,1'-Biphenol has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The diacetate group introduces two carbonyl groups, which can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl.",
