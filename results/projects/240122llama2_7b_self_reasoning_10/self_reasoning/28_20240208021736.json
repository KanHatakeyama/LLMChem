    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the phenyl group, which introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, raising the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl sulfone group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The bromine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
