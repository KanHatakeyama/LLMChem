    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is succinic acid, which has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of a rigid structure, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carboxyl group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
