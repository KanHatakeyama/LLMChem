    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrafluorobenzene has a melting point of -11.2\u00b0C, which is significantly lower than that of benzene (5.5\u00b0C). This is due to the presence of four fluorine atoms, which increase the molecular weight and electronegativity of the molecule, leading to stronger intermolecular interactions and a lower melting point.",
