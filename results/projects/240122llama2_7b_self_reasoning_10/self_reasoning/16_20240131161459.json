    "Reason": "3-methylquinoline n-oxide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is quinoline, which has a melting point of 106.5 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The n-oxide group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +10 \u00b0C.",
