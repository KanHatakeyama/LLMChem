    "Reason": "Voriconazole is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is the melting point of the parent compound, which is 106\u00b0C for piperazine. The presence of a phenyl group can increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Voriconazole has two phenyl groups, which can add approximately +20\u00b0C each. Additionally, the fluorine atom can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C. The piperazine ring itself can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group can also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the rigidity it brings, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C. Finally, the methyl group can lower the melting point due to the decrease in molecular weight and the reduction in crystalline structure, estimated at approximately -5\u00b0C.",
