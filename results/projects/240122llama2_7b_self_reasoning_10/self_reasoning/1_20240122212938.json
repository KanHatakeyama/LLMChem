    "Reason": "1,2-Diamines typically have a melting point increase due to the presence of two amino groups, which can form hydrogen bonds and enhance the crystalline structure. The basic unit for comparison can be ethylenediamine, which has a melting point of -11.4\u00b0C. Each amino group can contribute approximately +20\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding and rigidity.",
