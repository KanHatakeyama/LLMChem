    "Reason": "1-amino-butane has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The butyl group introduces a more rigid structure and raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two amino groups can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding potential, approximately +20\u00b0C.",
