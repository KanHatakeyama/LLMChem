    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in digitoxose will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
