    "Reason": "4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The allyl group (Cc1ccc(cc1O)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group (Oc1ccc(cc1O)C) introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The allyl group also introduces a rigid structure, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The methoxy group also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
