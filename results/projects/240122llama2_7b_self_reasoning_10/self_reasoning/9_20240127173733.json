    "Reason": "1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethylene (with a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius). The introduction of the tert-butyl group (C(C)C) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the tert-butyl group also introduces a bulky side chain which reduces the symmetry of the molecular structure, which generally raises the melting point. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to both molecular size and reduced symmetry.",
