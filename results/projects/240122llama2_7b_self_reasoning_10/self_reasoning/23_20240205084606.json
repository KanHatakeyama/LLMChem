    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The chloromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The two chlorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their high electronegativity, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C.",
