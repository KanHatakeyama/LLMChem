    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl is a functional group that can increase the melting point of a molecule. The basic unit of analysis is acetonitrile, which has a melting point of -21.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The 3-chlorophenyl group can increase the melting point due to the electronegativity of chlorine and the resulting dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 1 chlorine) = 10 degrees Celsius.",
