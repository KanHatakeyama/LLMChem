    "Reason": "1,1'-biphenyl-2,5-diol has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups and a dioxane-like bridging moiety can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +30 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The dioxane-like bridging moiety can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
