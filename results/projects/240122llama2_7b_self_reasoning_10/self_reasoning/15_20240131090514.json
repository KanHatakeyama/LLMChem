    "Reason": "3-chlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities significantly impact the melting point. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-system interactions, estimated at around +30\u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The trifluoromethyl group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +10\u00b0C for each trifluoromethyl group. The presence of three fluorine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C for each fluorine atom.",
