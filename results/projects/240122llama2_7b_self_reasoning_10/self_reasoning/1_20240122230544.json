    "Reason": "1H-carbazole has a melting point of 100\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the base melting point of benzene (5\u00b0C). The basic unit of analysis is a benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5\u00b0C. The carbazole structure has a melting point increase due to the presence of aromaticity, which enhances molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. The methoxy group in the carbazole structure can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The ether linkage can also contribute to the melting point increase, estimated at +2\u00b0C. The presence of a tetrahydro-group can also contribute to the melting point increase, estimated at +10\u00b0C.",
