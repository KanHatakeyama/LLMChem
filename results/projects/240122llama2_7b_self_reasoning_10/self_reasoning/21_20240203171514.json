    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the tert-butyl group (C(C)C) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The acrylate group (C(=O)C=C) introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The tert-butyl group also increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The net effect is a significant increase due to the combination of molecular size, hydrogen bonding, and the carbonyl-like functional group.",
