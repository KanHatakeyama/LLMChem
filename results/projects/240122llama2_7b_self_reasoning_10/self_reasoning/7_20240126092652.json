    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorophene has a melting point that is influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The molecular structure includes six chlorine atoms, which significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity and dipole moment. Each chlorine is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +100\u00b0C. Additionally, the molecular structure includes two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The molecular structure also includes a methyl group, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
