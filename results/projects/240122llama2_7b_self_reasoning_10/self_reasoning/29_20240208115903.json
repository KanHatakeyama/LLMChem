    "Reason": "2,2'-Bis(2-bromo-3-phenylpropyl)-4,4',7,7,7',7'-hexamethyl-2,2'-bi(bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)-3,3'-dione has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 3-phenylpropane, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group in the propane structure contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius per group, totaling +60 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and volume, with an approximate increase of +5 degrees Celsius. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30 degrees Celsius. The dione functional group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, with an approximate increase of +40 degrees Celsius per group, totaling +80 degrees Celsius.",
