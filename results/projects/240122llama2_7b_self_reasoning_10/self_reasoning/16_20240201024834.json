    "Reason": "1,3-di-p-tolyl-2-thiourea has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the thiourea group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The tolyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystalline structure and molecular weight. Each tolyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C.",
