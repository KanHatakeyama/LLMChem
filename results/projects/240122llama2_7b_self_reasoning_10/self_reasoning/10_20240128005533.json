    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, propane, has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a tert-butyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The acrylate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, rigidifying the structure and contributing approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The tert-butyl group also increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The presence of three phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius each, for a total increase of +60 degrees Celsius.",
