    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a melting point of -120.0 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
