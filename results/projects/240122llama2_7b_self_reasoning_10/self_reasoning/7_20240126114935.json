    "Reason": "1-methyl substitution generally lowers the melting point compared to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, the methyl group also reduces the crystal lattice stability, which might lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. Summing up these changes: Benzene base (5.5 degrees Celsius) and one methyl group (\u201310 degrees Celsius).",
