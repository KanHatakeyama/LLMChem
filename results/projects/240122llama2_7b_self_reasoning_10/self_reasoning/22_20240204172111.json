    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is 2-nitropyridine, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70 degrees Celsius. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one nitro group, we have +70 degrees Celsius total (having less influence due to the complex structure). Additionally, the bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
