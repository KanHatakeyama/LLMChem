    "Reason": "3-chloropropionitrile has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is propionitrile, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The chlorine atom also introduces a strong dipole moment, which enhances intermolecular interactions and increases the melting point. The chlorine atom also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size. The net effect is a significant increase in the melting point.",
