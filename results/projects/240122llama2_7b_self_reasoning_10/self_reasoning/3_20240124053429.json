    "Reason": "1-phenyl-benzeneethanol has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and a dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The ethanol group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
