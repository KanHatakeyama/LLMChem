    "Reason": "2-Methyl-2-lutumyl ether has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of ethanol, which is around -114.1 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered ethanol with two additional methyl groups, which would notably increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. However, the presence of two dimethylamino groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the additional rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential. Each dimethylamino group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
