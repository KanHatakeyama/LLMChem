    "Reason": "1H-carbazole has a melting point of around -100\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5\u00b0C. The introduction of the carbazole ring introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The additional functional groups, such as the two phenyl rings, contribute to the melting point through increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +30\u00b0C each. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The carbazole ring itself can also participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The net effect should thus be a significant increase due to the combination of molecular size, rigid structure, and additional hydrogen bonding.",
