    "Reason": "1,1-Thiobarbituric acid has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and two additional carbonyl groups. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of N,N-Bis{2-[bis(carboxymethyl)amino]ethyl}glycine, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Additionally, we have two additional carbonyl groups, which would increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The two additional carbonyl groups can also contribute approximately +20\u00b0C each, due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions.",
