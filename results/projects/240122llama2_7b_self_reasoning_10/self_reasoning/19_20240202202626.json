    "Reason": "1,3-Thiadiazole ring: The introduction of the 1,3-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The thiadiazole ring itself can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
