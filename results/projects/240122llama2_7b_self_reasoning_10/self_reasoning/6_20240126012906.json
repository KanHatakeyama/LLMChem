    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group (Oc1ccccc1O) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methoxy group (O) adds approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight. The carbamate group (1-carbam) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding. The ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) adds approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to reduced hydrogen bonding. The tryptamine base has a melting point around 92 degrees Celsius.",
