    "Reason": "1,2,3,5-tetraiodobenzene has a melting point that we can estimate by considering the effect of each iodine atom. Each iodine atom adds approximately +100\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and the presence of a strong dipole moment, which enhances intermolecular interactions and rigidity. The iodine atoms also contribute to the melting point by participating in hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The iodine atoms also increase the melting point due to the presence of a strong dipole moment, which enhances intermolecular interactions and rigidity.",
