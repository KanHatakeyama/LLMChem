    "Reason": "1-Methylpropyl group: The methylpropyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their high electronegativity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular weight, estimated at around -10\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group's effect might be higher due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their high electronegativity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each.",
