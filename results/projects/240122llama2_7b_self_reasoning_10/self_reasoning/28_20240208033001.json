    "Reason": "1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be 5-chlorotetrazole, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The tetrazole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group's effect might be around +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom's effect might be around +5 degrees Celsius. The tetrazole ring's effect might be around +20 degrees Celsius.",
