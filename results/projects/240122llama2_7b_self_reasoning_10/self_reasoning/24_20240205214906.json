    "Reason": "1,1,2,3-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with two fused aromatic rings, which increases the melting point due to pi-stacking interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +25 \u00b0C for this structural modification. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C.
