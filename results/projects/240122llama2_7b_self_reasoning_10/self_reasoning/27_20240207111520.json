    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the sulfonyl group (\u2013SO2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The acetamide group (\u2013CO\u2013) adds rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The benzene ring (\u2013Cc1ccc(cc1)\u2013) adds more rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The sulfur atom (\u2013S\u2013) adds more rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The nitrogen atom (\u2013N\u2013) adds more rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) adds more rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group (\u2013C=O\u2013) adds more rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The azide group (\u2013N=C(=O)\u2013) adds more rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
