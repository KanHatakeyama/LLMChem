    "Reason": "1-phenyl-substituted benzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The additional functional group and structural features in this compound will affect its melting point: (1) The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C; (2) The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +5\u00b0C.",
