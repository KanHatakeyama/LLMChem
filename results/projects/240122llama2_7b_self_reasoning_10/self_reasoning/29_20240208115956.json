    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The decyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and volume, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
