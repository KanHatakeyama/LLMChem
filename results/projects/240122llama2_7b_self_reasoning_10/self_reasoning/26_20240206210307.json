    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be 2,6-dinitrophenol, which has a melting point of -109.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the amino group (Nc1cc(cc([N+]([O-])=O)c1O)[N+]([O-])=O) in place of two hydrogen atoms increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The nitro group (\u2013NO2) introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The amino group (Nc1cc(cc([N+]([O-])=O)c1O)[N+]([O-])=O) introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces, with an approximate increase of +60 degrees Celsius.",
