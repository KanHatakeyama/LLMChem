    "Reason": "1-Propyl acetate has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is acetate, which has a melting point of -119.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a propyl group (\u2013CH2CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the propyl group also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and lower the melting point. The exact impact of the propyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate a moderate increase due to the additional rigid structure and molecular weight.",
