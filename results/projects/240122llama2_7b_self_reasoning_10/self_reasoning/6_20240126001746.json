    "Reason": "1,2-diiodomethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be hexamethylene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of 12 methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the siloxane structure also introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, which can further contribute to the melting point. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to both molecular size and rigidity.",
