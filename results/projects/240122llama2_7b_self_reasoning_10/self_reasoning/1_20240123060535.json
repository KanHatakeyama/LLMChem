    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C. The n-methyl group can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The n-octyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which can raise it by approximately +30\u00b0C. However, the exact impact of these structural modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
