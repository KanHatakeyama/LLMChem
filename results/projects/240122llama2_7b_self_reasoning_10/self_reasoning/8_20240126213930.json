    "Reason": "1-Methyl-2-propanone, also known as methyl methoxybenzene, has a melting point around -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a strong dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. Summing up these changes: Propane base (-18.0 degrees Celsius), methyl group (+10 degrees Celsius), methoxy group (+10 degrees Celsius), and carbonyl group (+20 degrees Celsius).",
