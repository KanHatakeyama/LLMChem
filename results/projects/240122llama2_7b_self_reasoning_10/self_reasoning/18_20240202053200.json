    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The phenylmethyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which raises the melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The exact impact depends on the specific functional group and structural modifications. For 1,4-benzendiol specifically, the introduction of the phenylmethyl group reduces the symmetry and introduces a bulky side chain, which raises the melting point by approximately +20 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
