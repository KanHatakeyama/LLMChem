    "Reason": "1,2-diols have a melting point of -118.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of siloxane groups (Si-O-Si) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each siloxane unit can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (20 degrees Celsius x 12 siloxane units) = 240 degrees Celsius.",
