    "Reason": "2-Methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group and an aldehyde group. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The aldehyde group raises the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and form a rigid structure, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
