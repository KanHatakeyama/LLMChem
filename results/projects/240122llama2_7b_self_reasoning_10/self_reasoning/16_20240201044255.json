    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The acetamide group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The trichloromethyl group raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
