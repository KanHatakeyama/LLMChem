    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,1'-phenyl-2,3-biphenyl, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
