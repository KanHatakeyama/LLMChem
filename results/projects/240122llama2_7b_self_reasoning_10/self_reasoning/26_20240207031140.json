    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C). Additionally, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group also introduces a hydroxyl group, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
