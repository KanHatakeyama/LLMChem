    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be 2,6-diphenyl-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly augment the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the carboxylic acid and its derivative can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
