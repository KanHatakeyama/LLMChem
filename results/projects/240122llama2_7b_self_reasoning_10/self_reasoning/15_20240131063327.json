    "Reason": "4-Nhac-2266-tetrame-piperidin-n-oxide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is piperidine, which has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-nhac-2266-tetrame-piperidin-n-oxide will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tetramethylene chain (C(C)C(C)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, contributing approximately +20; (3) The piperidine ring (N1C(CC(NC(=O)C)CC1(C)C)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
