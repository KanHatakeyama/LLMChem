    "Reason": "4-Chlorophenyl group can increase the melting point due to the presence of a bulky aromatic ring, which can enhance the crystalline structure and increase molecular weight. The chlorine atom also introduces a strong electronegative atom, which can participate in dipole interactions and further increase the melting point. The exact impact of the chlorine atom is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the chlorine atom as approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
