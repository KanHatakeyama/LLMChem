    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point due to reduced hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
