    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be butane (with a melting point of -11.2 degrees Celsius). The introduction of the heptanoyl group (\u2013CO2H) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of the ester group (-CO2H) also introduces steric hindrance and reduces the ability of the molecule to form hydrogen bonds, which can lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the heptanoyl group into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to steric hindrance. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point.",
