    "Reason": "1,3-thiazole ring: The 1,3-thiazole ring introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups and one chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The thiazole ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
