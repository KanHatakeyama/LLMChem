    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The compound we are analyzing has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the compound has two ether linkages, which would raise the melting point by approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
