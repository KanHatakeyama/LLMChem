    "Reason": "4-decylphenyl and methylbenzamide functionalities significantly impact the melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The decylphenyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methylbenzamide moiety introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The decyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The effects are additive.",
