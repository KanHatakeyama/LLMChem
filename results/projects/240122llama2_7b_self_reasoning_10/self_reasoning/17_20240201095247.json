    "Reason": "1H-carbazole has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1H-carbazole will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The carbazole ring itself can contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
