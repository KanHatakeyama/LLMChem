    "Reason": "1-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is pyrrole, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, increasing molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
