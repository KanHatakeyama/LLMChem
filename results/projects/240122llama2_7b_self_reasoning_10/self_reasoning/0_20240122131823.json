    "Reason": "2-fluoroquinoline-3-boronic acid is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is quinoline, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The fluoro substitution tends to lower the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and reduced pi-pi interactions. The boronic acid group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase the molecular weight.",
