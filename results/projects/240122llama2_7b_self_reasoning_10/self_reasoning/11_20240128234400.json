    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The m-bromobenzoic acid functional group introduces a carbonyl group, which can participate in dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C.",
