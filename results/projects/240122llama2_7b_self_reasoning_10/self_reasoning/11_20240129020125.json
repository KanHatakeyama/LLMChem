    "Reason": "1-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is pyrrole, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of these functional groups can be estimated as follows: (1) The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. (2) The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
