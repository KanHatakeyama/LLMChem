    "Reason": "1,3-propanedione has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group can also contribute to an increase in melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and the rigidity it introduces, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
