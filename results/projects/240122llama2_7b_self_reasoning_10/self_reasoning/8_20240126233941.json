    "Reason": "2-Amino-pyridine has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C. The pyridine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methylamino group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring, with its two additional phenyl groups, enhances the crystalline structure and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
