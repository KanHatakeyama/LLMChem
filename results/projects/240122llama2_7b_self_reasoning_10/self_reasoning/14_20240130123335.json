    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethylene (with a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius) because the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay between the rigid structure and hydrogen bonding.",
