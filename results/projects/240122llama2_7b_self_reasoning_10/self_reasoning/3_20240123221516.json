    "Reason": "Voriconazole is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the piperazine ring, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the piperazine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight. The fluorine atoms can also increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each. The methyl group can lower the melting point due to its small size and reduced molecular weight, estimated at around -10\u00b0C. The nitro group can also increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can also increase the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and their rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each. Finally, the methoxy group can lower the melting point due to its small size and reduced molecular weight, estimated at around -10\u00b0C. Summing up these modifications: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), two fluorine atoms (+20\u00b0C), one methyl group (-10\u00b0C), one nitro group (+10\u00b0C), and two phenyl groups (+20\u00b0C).",
