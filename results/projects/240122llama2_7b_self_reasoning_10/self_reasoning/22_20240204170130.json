    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be octanamide, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the octyl group increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius. The nitrogen within the amine group introduces a rigid structure, which raises the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume. The exact impact of these structural modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
