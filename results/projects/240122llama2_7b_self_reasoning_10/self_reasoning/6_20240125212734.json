    "Reason": "1-phenylcyclohexanol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit, cyclohexanol, has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. (2) The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. (3) The cyclohexyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
