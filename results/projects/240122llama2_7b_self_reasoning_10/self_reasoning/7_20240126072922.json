    "Reason": "4-chlorophenyl group introduces a significant dipole due to the chlorine atom, which raises the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The piperidine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance the crystalline structure and increase molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each.",
