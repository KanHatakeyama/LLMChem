    "Reason": "The basic unit, decane, has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of additional carbon atoms and their associated van der Waals interactions contribute to an increase in molecular weight and melting point. Each additional carbon atom is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (20 degrees Celsius x 10 carbon atoms) = 200 degrees Celsius.",
