    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of n-butane, which is around -10\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is propane, which has a melting point of -10\u00b0C. The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising it by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
