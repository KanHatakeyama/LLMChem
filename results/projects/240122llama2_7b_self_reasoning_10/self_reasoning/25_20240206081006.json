    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of the chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
