    "Reason": "1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison is ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The presence of four chlorine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the strong intermolecular forces between the chlorine atoms. Each chlorine atom can contribute around +50 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the strong intermolecular forces between the chlorine atoms.",
