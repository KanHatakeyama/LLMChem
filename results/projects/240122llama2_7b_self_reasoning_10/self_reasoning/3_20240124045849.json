    "Reason": "1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The phenyl group (C1ccccc1) adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The chlorine atom (Cl) raises the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to form hydrogen bonds. The tetrazole ring (nnnn2c1ccccc1) adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds.",
