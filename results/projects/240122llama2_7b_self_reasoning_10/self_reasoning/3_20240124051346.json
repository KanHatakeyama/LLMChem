    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound can be considered benzoic acid, which has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a phenyl group increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The benzoate group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. The exact impact of the phenyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate it as a rough estimate. The phenyl group might increase the melting point by around +20 degrees Celsius due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase molecular weight. The benzoate group might also contribute to the melting point, but its exact effect is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
