    "Reason": "1,6-hexanediol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The hexyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
