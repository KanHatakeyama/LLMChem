    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenyl can increase the melting point due to the additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduced molecular weight and volume. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of these functional groups in ethyl 4-cyanophenylacetate will contribute to an estimated melting point shift.",
