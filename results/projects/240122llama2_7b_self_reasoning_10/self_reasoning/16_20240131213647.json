    "Reason": "5-(4-morpholinyl)-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. Morpholinyl group: The morpholinyl ring introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The nitro group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
