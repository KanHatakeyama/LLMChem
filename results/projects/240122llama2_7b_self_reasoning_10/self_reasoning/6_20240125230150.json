    "Reason": "2-Methylphenyl group: The presence of a 2-methylphenyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional rigidity and molecular weight. This effect is estimated at around +10\u00b0C.\nN-phenylbenzamide group: The phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. This effect is estimated at around +20\u00b0C.\nCarbonyl group: The carbonyl group can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20\u00b0C.\nEther linkage: The presence of an ether linkage can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at around +2\u00b0C.",
