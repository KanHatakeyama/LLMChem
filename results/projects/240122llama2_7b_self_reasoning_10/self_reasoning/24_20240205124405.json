    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The phthalate group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
