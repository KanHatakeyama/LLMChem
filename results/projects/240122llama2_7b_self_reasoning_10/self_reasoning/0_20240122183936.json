    "Reason": "1H-pyrazole-5-methanol, 3-methyl- has a melting point of 100.5 \u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the base melting point of benzene (5.5 \u00b0C). The molecular structure consists of a pyrazole ring, which is a rigid and planar structure that can contribute to increased intermolecular forces and melting point. The methyl group attached to the pyrazole ring also contributes to the molecular weight and rigidity, further enhancing the melting point.",
