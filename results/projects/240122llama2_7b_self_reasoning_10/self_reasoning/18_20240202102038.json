    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a 2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional functional group and the rigidity it brings. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The propanone base itself has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius.",
