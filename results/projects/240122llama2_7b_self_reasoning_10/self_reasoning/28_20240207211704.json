    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can sterically hinder the crystal lattice, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
