    "Reason": "2-Methyl-cyclopentanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentane, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius.",
