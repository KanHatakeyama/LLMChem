    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison can be butane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. 2. The introduction of two ethyl groups and two butyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The ethyl groups add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity, while the butyl groups add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of four rigid structures. Additionally, the butyl groups also increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of four rigid structures. The net effect is a significant increase in the melting point.",
