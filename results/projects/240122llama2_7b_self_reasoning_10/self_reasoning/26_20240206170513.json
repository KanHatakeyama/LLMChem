    "Reason": "1,2-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The anthrone base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a piperidine ring and a benzene ring. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The benzene ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C.",
