    "Reason": "1,1'-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is 1,1'-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The additional functionalities and structural features in p-chlorophenol will affect its melting point: (1) The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
