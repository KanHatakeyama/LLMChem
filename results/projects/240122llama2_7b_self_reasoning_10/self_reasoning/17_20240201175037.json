    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The stilbene ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for this structural feature. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.
