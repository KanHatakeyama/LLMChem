    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The indole ring itself contributes to a more rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
