    "Reason": "2-fluoro-4-nitrobenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is 4-nitrobenzoic acid, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one nitro group, we have +50\u00b0C, one fluorine atom at +20\u00b0C, and one methoxy group at +70\u00b0C.",
