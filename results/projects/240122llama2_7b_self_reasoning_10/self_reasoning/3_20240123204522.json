    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit of analysis is the imidazole ring, which has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to its rigidity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. The phenyl groups increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the imidazole ring can form hydrogen bonds, which can contribute to the melting point. The total effect of the phenyl groups is estimated at around +60 to +80\u00b0C.",
