    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would significantly augment the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the carboxylic acid group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
