    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid has a melting point of 120\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the melting point of its constituent parts. The cyclohexene group contributes to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an estimated increase of +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group also contributes to the melting point, as it introduces a carboxylate group that can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of two carboxyl groups can also enhance the melting point through increased molecular weight and dipole interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C each.",
