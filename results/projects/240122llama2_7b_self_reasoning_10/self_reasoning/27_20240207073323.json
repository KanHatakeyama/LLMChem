    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the terephthalate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The oxygen within the methoxy group also introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C.",
