    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The furanyl group (C2(C)C) and isopropyl group (C(C)C) add rigidity and molecular weight, contributing approximately +20 each. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) adds more molecular weight and rigidity, contributing approximately +30. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +40. The nitro group (C=O) raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, with an approximate increase of +50. The methoxy group (C(=O)OC) adds more molecular weight and rigidity, contributing approximately +20. The ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) has a slight lowering effect because it does not participate in hydrogen bonding as intensely as a hydroxyl group would. The effects are additive.",
