    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl group: The introduction of a 3-chlorophenyl group increases the melting point due to the additional rigidity and molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.\nFluorine substituents: The trifluoromethyl group (\u2013F\u2013F\u2013F) adds rigidity and molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C each.",
