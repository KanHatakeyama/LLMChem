    "Reason": "2-vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point that can be estimated by considering the basic unit of benzoic acid (melting point of 120.5\u00b0C) and the effect of the vinyl group. The vinyl group introduces a flexible chain, which can lower the melting point due to increased molecular volume and reduced rigidity. However, the presence of a carboxyl group can also increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and the formation of a rigid structure. The exact impact of the vinyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. A rough estimate for the effect of the vinyl group could be around -10\u00b0C.",
