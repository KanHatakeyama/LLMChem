    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The acetonitrile group introduces a significant increase due to the additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces a slight increase due to the additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces a significant increase due to the additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
