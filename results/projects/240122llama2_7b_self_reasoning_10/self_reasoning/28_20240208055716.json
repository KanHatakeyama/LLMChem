    "Reason": "1-Nitro-functionality introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. Two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the tert-butyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which raises the melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The hydrazono-functionalities and thiadiazole ring introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for two phenyl groups, we have +100\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +20\u00b0C, the tert-butyl group at +10\u00b0C, and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +70\u00b0C.",
