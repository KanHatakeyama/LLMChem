    "Reason": "2-Ethyloxirane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group introduces a rigid structure and reduces the symmetry, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The oxirane ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
