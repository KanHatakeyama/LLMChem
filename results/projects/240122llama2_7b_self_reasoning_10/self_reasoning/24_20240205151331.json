    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-nitrobenzene has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The introduction of three methyl groups and a nitro group increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl groups add approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
