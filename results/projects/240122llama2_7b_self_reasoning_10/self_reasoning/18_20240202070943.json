    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point due to the absence of hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius.",
