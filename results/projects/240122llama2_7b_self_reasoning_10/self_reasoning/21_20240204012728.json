    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The acetonitrile group introduces a significant decrease due to the additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around -10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces a slight increase due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius.",
