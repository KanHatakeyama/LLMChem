    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be oleic acid, which has a melting point of -11.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). Methylation of the carboxyl group of oleic acid increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect of methylation on the melting point is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the impact of methylation based on the general trends observed in similar compounds. The methyl group can increase the melting point by approximately 5-10\u00b0C, depending on the specific compound and the extent of methylation.",
