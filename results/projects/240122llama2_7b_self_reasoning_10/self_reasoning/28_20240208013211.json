    "Reason": "1,3-Diphenylpropane-1,3-dione has a melting point that we can compare to 1,3-propanedione, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups significantly increases the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
