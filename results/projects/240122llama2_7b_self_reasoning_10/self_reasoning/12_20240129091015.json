    "Reason": "4-decylphenyl and methylbenzamide functionalities significantly impact the melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzamide, which has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius. The decylphenyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity and reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The decyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The benzamide group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
