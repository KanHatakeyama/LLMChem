    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities significantly impact the melting point. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms, being heavy and rigid, enhance the crystalline structure and molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C each. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The chlorine and fluorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the presence of polar functional groups, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each.",
