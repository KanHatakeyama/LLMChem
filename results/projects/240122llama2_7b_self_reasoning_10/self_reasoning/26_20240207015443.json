    "Reason": "1-oxoindane has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be indane, which has a melting point of 39.5 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of one additional phenyl ring and one additional carbonyl group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The carbonyl group also raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. However, the 1-oxoindane base has a more rigid structure than indane, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The additional phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
