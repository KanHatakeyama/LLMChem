    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the piperidine ring (NCCNC) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The acetamide group (C(=O)N) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methylene-cyclobutane formation introduces a rigid structure with four-membered ring formation, which might raise the melting point by approximately +35 degrees Celsius. The presence of two fluorine substituents can significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 2 fluorines) = 30 degrees Celsius.",
