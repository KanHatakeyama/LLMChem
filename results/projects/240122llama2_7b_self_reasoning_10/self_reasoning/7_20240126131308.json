    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The presence of a phenylmethyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional rigid structure and molecular weight. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
