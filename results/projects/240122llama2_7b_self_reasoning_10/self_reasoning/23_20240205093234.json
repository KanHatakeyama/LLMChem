    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The benzoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The acetamide group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
