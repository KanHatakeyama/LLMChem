    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base with two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The digoxigenin structure also possesses a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
