    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison is butane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the heptanoate group (\u2013COO\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The heptanoate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional methyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the heptanoate group, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius for each additional methyl group.",
