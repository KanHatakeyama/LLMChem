    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The compound we are comparing has two fluorine substituents, which significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methane group introduces a rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
