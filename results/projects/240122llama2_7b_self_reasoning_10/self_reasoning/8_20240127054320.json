    "Reason": "1-ethylaniline has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is aniline, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of an ethyl group (\u2013CH2CH3) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the ethyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
