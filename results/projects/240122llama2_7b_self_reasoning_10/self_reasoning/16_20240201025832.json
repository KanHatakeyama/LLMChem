    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the succinic acid moiety, which has a melting point of around 120 \u00b0C. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each bromine. Additionally, the carboxyl group introduces a polar carbonyl-like functionalities, which might raise the melting point by approximately +30 \u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
