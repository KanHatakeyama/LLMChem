    "Reason": "2,2'-Benzene-1,3-diyldiimino is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to its rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of this functional group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. Additionally, the molecular structure includes two methoxy groups, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The dioxane-like bridging moiety also contributes to the melting point, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
