    "Reason": "1-Isocyanatooctadecane has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The isocyanate group can increase the melting point due to the presence of a strong dipole moment and increased molecular weight. The exact impact of the isocyanate group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, a general estimate for the impact of a single isocyanate group is around +10 degrees Celsius.",
