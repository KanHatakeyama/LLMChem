    "Reason": "2-Amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 3-fluoropyridine, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2-amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine will affect its melting point: (1) The fluorine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. (2) The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. (3) The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
