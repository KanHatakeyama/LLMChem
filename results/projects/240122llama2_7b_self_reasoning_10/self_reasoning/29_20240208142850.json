    "Reason": "4,4-Bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The compound has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the dimethylamino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5\u00b0C each.",
