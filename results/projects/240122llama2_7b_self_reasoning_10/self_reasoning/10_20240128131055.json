    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanol, the base unit, has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The introduction of a benzamide group (\u2013CO\u2013NH\u2013) adds rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The benzene ring in the base unit contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
