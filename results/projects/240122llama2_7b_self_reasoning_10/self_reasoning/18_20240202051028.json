    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups and a methoxy group can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 to +10\u00b0C. Additionally, the naphthalenyl group can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each naphthalenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
