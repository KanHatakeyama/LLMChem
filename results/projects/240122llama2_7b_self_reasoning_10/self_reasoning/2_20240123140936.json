    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be formic acid, which has a melting point of -11.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a hexyl group (C6H13) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) in the formate functional group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point. The exact impact of the hexyl group and formate functional group on the melting point is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the hexyl group as a rough estimate of +30 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and size. The formate functional group can lower the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to hydrogen bonding potential. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to the hexyl group but a more significant decrease due to the formate functional group.",
