    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The phenyl group in 2-phenylhydroquinone increases the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The hydroquinone moiety also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
