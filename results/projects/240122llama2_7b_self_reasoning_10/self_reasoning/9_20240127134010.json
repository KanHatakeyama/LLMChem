    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C. Additionally, the hydroquinone moiety introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +20 \u00b0C.",
