    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1,2-bis(chloromethyl)benzene will affect its melting point: (1) Two chloromethyl groups, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius for each chloromethyl group.",
