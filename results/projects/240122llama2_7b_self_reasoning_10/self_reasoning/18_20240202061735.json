    "Reason": "4-methyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be 3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group also introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: 3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide base (+100\u00b0C), one methyl group (-10\u00b0C), and one sulfonamide group (+20\u00b0C).",
