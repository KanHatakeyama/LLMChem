    "Reason": "3-heptene has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of three additional carbon atoms and two additional hydrogen atoms. The additional carbon atoms increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The additional hydrogen atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, raising it by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
