    "Reason": "4-decylphenyl and methyl substitutions generally lower the melting point compared to a phenyl group, as they reduce the molecular weight and steric hindrance. Each decyl group can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to reduced molecular weight and steric hindrance. The methyl group also contributes to a slight decrease in melting point due to its reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
