    "Reason": "1,1-Nitrophenyl acetate has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a nitro group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The nitro group can raise the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C. Additionally, the acetate group can contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C.",
