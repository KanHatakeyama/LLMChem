    "Reason": "1,1'-Carboniban, a compound with a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius, has a melting point that we can use as a base for comparison. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in p-cyanophenol will affect its melting point: (1) The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius; (2) The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
