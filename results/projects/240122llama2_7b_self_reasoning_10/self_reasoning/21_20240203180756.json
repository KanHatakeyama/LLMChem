    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone has two phenyl groups, which would each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group also introduces two amino groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, adding about +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) may also add roughly +20 due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact.",
