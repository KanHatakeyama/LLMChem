    "Reason": "The melting point of o-iodobenzonitrile can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The nitrile group can also contribute to the melting point, but the exact value is difficult to estimate due to the complex structure and the presence of multiple functional groups. However, we can assume a moderate increase of around +10 degrees Celsius due to the additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential.",
