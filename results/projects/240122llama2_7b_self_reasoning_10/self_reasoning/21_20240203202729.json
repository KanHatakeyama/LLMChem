    "Reason": "9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, estimated at +30 \u00b0C. The fluorenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at +30 \u00b0C. The succinimide group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight, van der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonding.",
