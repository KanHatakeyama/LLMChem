    "Reason": "9-bromofluorene has a melting point that we can compare to fluorene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly augment the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
