    "Reason": "1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to the base of butane, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The isobutyryl group introduces a bulky structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
