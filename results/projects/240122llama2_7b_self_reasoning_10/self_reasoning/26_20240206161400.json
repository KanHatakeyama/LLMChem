    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a cyano group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the molecular weight. The cyano group can also enhance the crystalline structure and increase the melting point due to the rigidity it introduces. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of one additional phenyl ring and one additional functional group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The cyano group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of one additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The cyano group can also enhance the crystalline structure and increase the melting point due to the rigidity it introduces.",
