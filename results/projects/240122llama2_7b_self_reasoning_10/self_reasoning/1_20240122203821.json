    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol has a melting point of approximately 50 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methoxyphenoxy group increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methoxy group raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The carbamate group also increases the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight.",
