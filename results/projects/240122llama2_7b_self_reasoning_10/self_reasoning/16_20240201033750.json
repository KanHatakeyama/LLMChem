    "Reason": "1-chlorooctane has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of octane, which is around -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the octyl chain, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom also introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
