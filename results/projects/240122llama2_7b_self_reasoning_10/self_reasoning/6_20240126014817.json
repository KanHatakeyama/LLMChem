    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is succinic acid, which has a melting point of around 120 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius each. The carboxyl group introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius each.",
