    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the ketone group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The methyl group has a similar effect, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
