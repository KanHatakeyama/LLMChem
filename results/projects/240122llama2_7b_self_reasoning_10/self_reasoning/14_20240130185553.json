    "Reason": "4,4'-Dichlorobenzilate has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered 4-chlorobenzene, which has a melting point of -10\u00b0C. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings and a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the dichloro group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C.",
