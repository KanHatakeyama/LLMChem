    "Reason": "1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy-, tri has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of three carboxylic acid groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the hydroxyl group introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The tri-functional structure also introduces additional rigidity, which can contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +10\u00b0C for this structural feature.",
