    "Reason": "1,3-dioxolane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight.",
