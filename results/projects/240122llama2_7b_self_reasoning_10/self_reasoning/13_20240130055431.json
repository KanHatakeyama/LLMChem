    "Reason": "1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-Octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of butane, which is around -10\u00b0C. The fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 8 fluorines) = 120 degrees Celsius. The iodine atom also increases the melting point due to the presence of a dipole moment, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
