    "Reason": "4-bromodiphenyl ether has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is diphenyl ether, which has a melting point around 10 degrees Celsius due to the presence of two phenyl groups. The bromine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
