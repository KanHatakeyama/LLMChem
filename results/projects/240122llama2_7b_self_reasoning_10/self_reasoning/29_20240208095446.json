    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone has two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +40 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each amino group can also contribute approximately +10 due to the presence of hydrogen bonding. The presence of two carbonyl groups also raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
