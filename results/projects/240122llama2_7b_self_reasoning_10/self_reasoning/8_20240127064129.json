    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole moment, which can significantly increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The nitro group can raise the melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. Additionally, the stilbene ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C.",
