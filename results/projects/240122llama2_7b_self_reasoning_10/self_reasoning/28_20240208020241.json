    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The anthracene base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to its planar, aromatic structure with a high melting point. The nitro group's effect is more significant than the anthracene base's due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
