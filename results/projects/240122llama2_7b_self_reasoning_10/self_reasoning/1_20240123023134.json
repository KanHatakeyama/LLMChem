    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanolamine has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The presence of two benzene rings increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the diphenyl group creates a more rigid structure, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
