    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). 2. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings, a benzyl group, and a propylidene linkage. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure and a larger molecular volume, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The propylidene linkage introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. 3. The hydrazono group introduces a strong dipole, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. 4. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion can significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
