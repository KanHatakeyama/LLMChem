    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group, a sulfonyl group, and a pyrrole ring. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure and a dipole, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The pyrrole ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
