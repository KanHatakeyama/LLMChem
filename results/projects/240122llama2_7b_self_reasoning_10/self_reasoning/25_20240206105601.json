    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base, with two additional phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the phenyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +2\u00b0C.",
