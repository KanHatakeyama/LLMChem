    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
