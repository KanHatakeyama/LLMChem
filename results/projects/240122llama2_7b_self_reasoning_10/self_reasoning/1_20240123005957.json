    "Reason": "5,6-dimethylchrysene has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of -5.5 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The chrysene ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and planarity. The methyl groups can contribute around +20 to +30 degrees Celsius, while the chrysene ring can contribute around +10 to +20 degrees Celsius.",
