    "Reason": "1,1'-Spiro-2-benzopyran base, with two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Additionally, the presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The ketone group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity.",
