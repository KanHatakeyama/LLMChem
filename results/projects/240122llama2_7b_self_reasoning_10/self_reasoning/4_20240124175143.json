    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of a phenylmethyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) will lower the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding opportunity. The phenyl group itself will also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase molecular weight. The exact impact of the phenylmethyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate its effect as a rough estimate. The phenyl group might add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase molecular weight. The methyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) will lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to its reduced molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding opportunity. The effects are additive.",
