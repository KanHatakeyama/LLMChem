    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The stilbene ring itself contributes to a more rigid structure, with a melting point increase of approximately +20\u00b0C due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure. The methylene bridge introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
