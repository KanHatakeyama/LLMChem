    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chloromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The two chlorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of polar functional groups, estimated at approximately +5\u00b0C each.",
