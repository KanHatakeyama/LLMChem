    "Reason": "3-Methoxyphenyl groups, when connected to a phosphine base, significantly increase the melting point due to the additional rigidity and pi-system. Each methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +5 \u00b0C. The phosphine base itself contributes to a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The presence of three methoxyphenyl groups raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and pi-system, estimated at approximately +60 \u00b0C.",
