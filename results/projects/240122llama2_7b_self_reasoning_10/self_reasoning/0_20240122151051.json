    "Reason": "Physostigmine is a choline ester that contains a variety of functional groups that can impact its melting point. The basic unit for this compound is the benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom can lower the melting point by approximately -5\u00b0C due to increased molecular mobility. The hydroxyl group can also contribute to a slight increase in melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding capabilities. The carbamate group, which is linked to the benzene ring via an ester linkage, can also contribute to a slight increase in melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance. The phenyl group linked to the nitrogen atom can also increase the melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity.",
