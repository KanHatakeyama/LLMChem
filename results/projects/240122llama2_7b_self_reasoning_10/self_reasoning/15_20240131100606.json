    "Reason": "1,3-Benzodioxole has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The methylene bridge (O=C1C(SC2=NCCCN12)=Cc4ccc3OCOc3c4) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The thiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius. The pyrimidine ring also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group can also raise the melting point due to its effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
