    "Reason": "1,3-dioxane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group and an ethyl group. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance the crystalline structure and increase molecular weight. The ethyl group is estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
