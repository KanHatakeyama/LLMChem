    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The methyl group also introduces a new hydrogen bonding potential, which can further contribute to the melting point. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to both molecular size and hydrogen bonding.",
