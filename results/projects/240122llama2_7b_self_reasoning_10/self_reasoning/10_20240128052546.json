    "Reason": "1,3-dioxane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, methane, has a melting point of -161.5 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each bromine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (20 degrees Celsius x 1 bromine) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
