    "Reason": "1,1,2,3,4-pentachloro-2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-fluoranaphthene has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be chlorine, which has a melting point of -119.6 degrees Celsius. The introduction of five chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the chlorine atom also increases the electronegativity which can lead to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 5 chlorines) = 50 degrees Celsius.",
