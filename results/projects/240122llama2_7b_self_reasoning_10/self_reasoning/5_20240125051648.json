    "Reason": "5-tert-butyl-2-methyl-3-furoic acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is furan, which has a melting point of -10.5 \u00b0C. The tert-butyl group (C(C)C) adds approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular volume and rigidity of the structure. The methyl group (C) adds +5 due to increasing the molecular weight and reducing the symmetry. The carbonyl group (C=O) adds +5 due to forming hydrogen bonds and increasing the molecular weight. The furoic acid moiety (Cc1c(cc(o1)C(C)(C)C)C(=O)O) introduces a rigid structure and additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
