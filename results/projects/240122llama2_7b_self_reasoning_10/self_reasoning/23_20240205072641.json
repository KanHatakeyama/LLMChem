    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a melting point that we can compare to 2-nitropyridine, which has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
