    "Reason": "4-Nhac-2266-tetrame-piperidin-n-oxide has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of four additional piperidine rings. Piperidine itself has a melting point of around 106 \u00b0C, which is significantly higher than benzene due to its rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential. The additional piperidine rings will contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C per additional piperidine ring.",
