    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which raises it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which raises it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of two chlorine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding.",
