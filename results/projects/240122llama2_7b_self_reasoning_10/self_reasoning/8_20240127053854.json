    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-Pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a bromine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The fluorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their high electronegativity, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each.",
