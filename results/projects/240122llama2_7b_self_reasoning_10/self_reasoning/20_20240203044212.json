    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is 2-methylanisole, which has a melting point around 50\u00b0C. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
