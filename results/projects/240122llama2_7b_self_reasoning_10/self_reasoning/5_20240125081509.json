    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl functionalities are known to increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance molecular rigidity and pi-pi interactions. The chlorine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which may contribute to a slight increase in melting point. The exact impact of these functionalities is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of these functionalities as follows: 3-chlorophenyl: +30 to +50\u00b0C, trifluoromethyl: +10 to +20\u00b0C, and chlorine: +50\u00b0C.",
