    "Reason": "2,2'-Bis(2-bromo-3-phenylpropyl)-4,4',7,7,7',7'-hexamethyl-2,2'-bi(bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)-3,3'-dione has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 3-phenylpropane, which has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dione interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The phenyl group in the propane structure contributes to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a slight increase due to the additional molecular weight, estimated at around +2\u00b0C. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The dione functional group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight.",
