    "Reason": "2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl alcohol has a melting point of 48.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit of benzene has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, and each methyl group adds approximately +10 \u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding capabilities. The presence of three methyl groups results in a total increase of +30 \u00b0C. Additionally, the alcohol functional group can also contribute to the melting point, although the exact value is difficult to estimate due to the lack of specific data. However, based on the general trend of alcohols, we can assume a moderate increase of approximately +10 \u00b0C.",
