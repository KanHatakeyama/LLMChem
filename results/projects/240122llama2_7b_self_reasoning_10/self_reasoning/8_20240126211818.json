    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point that we will compare to pyridine, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be pyridine. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of five chlorine atoms. Chlorine atoms significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity and the ability to form intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to add approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
