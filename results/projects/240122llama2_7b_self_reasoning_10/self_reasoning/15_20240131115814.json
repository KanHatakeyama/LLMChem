    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is succinic acid, which has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius each. The carboxyl group introduces a polar carbonyl-like functionalities, which raises the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
