    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups and a bromine atom increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the formation of a rigid structure and the presence of a halogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
