    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group, when connected to a 1,2-propanediol base, introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The amino group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The ether linkage introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The effects are additive.",
