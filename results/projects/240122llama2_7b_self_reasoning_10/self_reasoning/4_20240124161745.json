    "Reason": "5-methyl-3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1H-pyrazole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 1-methyl-3-phenyl-1H-pyrazole, which has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. (2) The methyl group (\u2013CH3) adds approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. (3) The two phenyl groups (\u2013C(C)C) add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. (4) The trimethylphenyl group (\u2013C(C)C(C)C) adds approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
