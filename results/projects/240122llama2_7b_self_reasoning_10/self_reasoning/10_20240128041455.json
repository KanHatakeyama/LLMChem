    "Reason": "4-decylphenyl and methylbenzamide functionalities significantly impact the melting point. The basic unit for comparison is 4-methylbenzamide, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The decylphenyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methylbenzamide moiety also contributes to the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of these functional groups raises the melting point significantly.",
