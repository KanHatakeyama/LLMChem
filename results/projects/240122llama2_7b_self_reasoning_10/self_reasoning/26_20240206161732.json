    "Reason": "3-methylquinoline n-oxide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is quinoline, which has a melting point of 106.5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The nitrogen within the amide group also introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C. The oxygen within the methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
