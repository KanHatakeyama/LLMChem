    "Reason": "5-bromoindole has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The indole ring introduces pi-pi interactions and rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5\u00b0C.",
