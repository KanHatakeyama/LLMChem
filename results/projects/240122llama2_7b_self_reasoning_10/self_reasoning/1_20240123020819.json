    "Reason": "1,1,1,3,3,3-hexadeutero-2-propanone has a melting point that can be predicted by comparing it to the base compound, 2-propanone, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The addition of six deuterium atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the deuterium atoms also increase the molecular rigidity, which can lower the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay between these two factors. The increased molecular weight and size contribute to a higher melting point, while the increased rigidity reduces it. The exact contribution of each factor is difficult to estimate, but a reasonable estimate is that the deuterium atoms increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to their effect on molecular rigidity.",
