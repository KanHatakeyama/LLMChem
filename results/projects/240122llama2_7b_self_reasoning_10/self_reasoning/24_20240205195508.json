    "Reason": "4-methyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point. The sulfonamide group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point. The methyl group also introduces a more significant effect on the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
