    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
