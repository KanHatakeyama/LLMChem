    "Reason": "1,1'-Thiodiglycol, also known as lauramide, has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a large, rigid, and hydrophobic structure with a melting point-raising effect. The lauramide molecule has a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the melting point of benzene due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
