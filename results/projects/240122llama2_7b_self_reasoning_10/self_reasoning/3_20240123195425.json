    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group also introduces a small rigid structure, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
