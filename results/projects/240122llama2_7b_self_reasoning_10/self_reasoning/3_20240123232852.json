    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanol, also known as cinnamaldehyde, has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for analysis is the ethanal moiety, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which increases intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The two phenyl groups in cinnamaldehyde contribute to the melting point due to their rigidity and increased molecular weight. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
