    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. Naproanilide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit, propanediol, has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in naproanilide will affect its melting point: (a) The methoxyphenoxy group (2-methoxyphenoxy) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces; (b) The carbamate group (1-carbam) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The effects are additive.",
