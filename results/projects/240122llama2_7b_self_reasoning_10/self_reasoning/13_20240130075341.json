    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point of 116 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be piperazine, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a nitro group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a piperazine ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
