    "Reason": "1-Aspartic acid base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that asparagine itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The aspartic acid group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.
