    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the imidazole ring, which has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions. The phenyl group (c1ccc(cc1)c2) adds approximately +30\u00b0C due to increasing molecular weight and rigidity. The imidazole ring itself has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions. The phenyl group also adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +30\u00b0C.",
