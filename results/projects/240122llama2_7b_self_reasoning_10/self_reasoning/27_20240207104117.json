    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: The basic unit for this compound is 2-nitrophenol, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The morpholinyl group (5-morpholinyl) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20. The nitro group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbamate group (1-carbam) adds more rigidity, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The ether linkage introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +2\u00b0C. The effects are additive.",
