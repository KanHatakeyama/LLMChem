    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. Voriconazole has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including a 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane-like moiety, which significantly increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity leading to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. Additionally, Voriconazole has a piperidine-like base, which can contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-system, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for this structural feature. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for each methoxy group. The ether linkage can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for the ether linkage.",
