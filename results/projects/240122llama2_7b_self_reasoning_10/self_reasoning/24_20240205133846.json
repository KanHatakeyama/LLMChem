    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The cyano group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The phenol group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
