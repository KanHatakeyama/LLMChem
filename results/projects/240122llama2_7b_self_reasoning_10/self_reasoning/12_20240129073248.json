    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethylene (with a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C) because the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight. The methyl group also introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point. The methyl group can be estimated to add approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding.",
