    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, oxazolam has a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature. The compound also has a nitro group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
