    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is benzamide, which has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in N-benzylbenzamide will affect its melting point: (1) The benzyl group (C1=CC=CC=C1) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius; (2) The methoxyphenoxy group (O=C(OCC(O)C)OC) introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius; (3) The carbamate group (1-carbam) raises the melting point due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
