    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a polar functional group, forming hydrogen bonds and increasing the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius.",
