    "Reason": "1,1'-Biphenol has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. Each biphenyl ring contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. Each biphenyl group may raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the presence of two acetate groups can contribute to the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Each acetate group may raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
