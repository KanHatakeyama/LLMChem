    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a benzyl group, which can increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The thiosemicarbazide moiety also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and create a more rigid structure. The benzyl group can be estimated to add approximately 20\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The thiosemicarbazide moiety can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and create a more rigid structure.",
