    "Reason": "4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene has a melting point of -105.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an ethyl group (\u2013CH2CH3) and two methyl groups (\u2013CH3) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a new dihedral angle, which can increase the molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, further contributing to the melting point. The methyl groups also contribute to the molecular weight and rigidity.",
