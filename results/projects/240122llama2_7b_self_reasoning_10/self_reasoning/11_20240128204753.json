    "Reason": "1E-N-hydroxy-1-(4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl)propan-1-imine has a melting point that we can compare to the melting point of the base compound, which is propane. The basic unit for comparison is propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1E-N-hydroxy-1-(4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl)propan-1-imine will affect its melting point: (1) The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which raises the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. (2) The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which might increase the melting point by approximately +2 degrees Celsius. (3) The trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl group introduces a bulky structure, which might increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
