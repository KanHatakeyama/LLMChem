    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
