    "Reason": "1,2-thiadiazole ring: The presence of a 1,2-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, contributing around +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C.",
