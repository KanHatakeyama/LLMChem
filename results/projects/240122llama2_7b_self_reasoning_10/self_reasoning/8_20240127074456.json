    "Reason": "1-amino-decan-1-ylamine has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of a decyl group (C12) increases the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The amine group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +2\u00b0C.",
