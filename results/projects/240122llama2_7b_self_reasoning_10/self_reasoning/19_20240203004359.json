    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with two additional phenyl groups, which would significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the benzoxy group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
