    "Reason": "1-methylcyclohexane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be cyclohexane, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom reduces the molecular weight and size, which generally lowers the melting point. However, the additional functional group introduces a new hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in cyclohexane, the additional methyl group allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methyl group into consideration, we can predict a decreased melting point but not as low as the decrease observed with cyclohexane's hydrogen bonding alone.",
