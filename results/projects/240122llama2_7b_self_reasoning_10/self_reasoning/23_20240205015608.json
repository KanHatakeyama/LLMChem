    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces additional rigidity and reduces the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at around -5 degrees Celsius.",
