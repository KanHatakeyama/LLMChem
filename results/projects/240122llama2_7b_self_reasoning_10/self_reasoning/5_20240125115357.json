    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-imidazolidine has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is 1,3,5-trimethyl-2-imidazolidine, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in tetrahydroxysuccinic acid will affect its melting point: (1) The carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O) adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a carboxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding; (2) The methyl groups (C(=O)O) add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a methyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding; (3) The imidazolidine ring (O=C(N1CCCC1)C(=O)O) adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a rigid ring structure; (4) The hydroxyl group (O) adds approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
