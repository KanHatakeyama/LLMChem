    "Reason": "4'-(methylthio)acetophenone has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The methylthio group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The acetophenone group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +2 \u00b0C.",
