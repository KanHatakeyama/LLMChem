    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-nitrobenzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of three methyl groups and a nitro group increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The nitro group also introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The methyl groups add approximately +10 \u00b0C due to slight increases in molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions.",
