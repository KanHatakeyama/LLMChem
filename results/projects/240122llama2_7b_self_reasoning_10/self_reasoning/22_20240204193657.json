    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The naphthyl groups contribute to the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each naphthyl group may add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
