    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene (cis) has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the chlorine atoms also increase the electronegativity and polarizability, which can lead to stronger intermolecular interactions and a higher melting point. The exact effect of the chlorine atoms is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can assume that the increase in molecular weight and size dominates the effect of the chlorine atoms, which would raise the melting point by approximately +20 to +30 degrees Celsius.",
