    "Reason": "1E-N,N'-bis(4-methylphenyl)-2-[(4-methylphenyl)amino]ethanimidamide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanimidamide, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methylphenyl group (C)cc1ccccc1 adds approximately +20 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The 4-methylphenyl group (C)cc1ccccc1 adds approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The amino group (N) adds approximately +5 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The piperidine ring (N) adds approximately +20 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methyl group (C) adds approximately +5 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
