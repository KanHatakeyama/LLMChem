    "Reason": "1,1,2,3,4-pentachloro-1,4-benzene-5,1-dione has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of five chlorine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 5 chlorines) = 50 degrees Celsius.",
