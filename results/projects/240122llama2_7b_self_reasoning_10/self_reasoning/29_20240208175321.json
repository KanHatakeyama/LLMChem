    "Reason": "1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-Octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of butane, which is around -10\u00b0C. The fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The iodine atom also increases the melting point due to the presence of a dipole moment, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The octafluoro group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
