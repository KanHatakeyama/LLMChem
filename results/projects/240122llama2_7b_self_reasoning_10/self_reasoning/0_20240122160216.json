    "Reason": "4-iodobenzylamine has a melting point that can be predicted by comparing it to the melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C. The iodine atom adds a significant increase in the melting point due to its electronegativity and the resulting dipole moment. The iodine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 100 degrees Celsius.",
