    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a sulfonyl group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The sulfonyl group can also increase the melting point due to the presence of a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding.
