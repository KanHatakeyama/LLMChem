    "Reason": "2-Aminopropane has a melting point of -72.5 degrees Celsius. The amino group (NH2) is a polar functional group which can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. The additional electronegativity of the nitrogen atom also contributes to the increase in melting point. The estimated increase in melting point due to the amino group is around 20 degrees Celsius.",
