    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius.",
