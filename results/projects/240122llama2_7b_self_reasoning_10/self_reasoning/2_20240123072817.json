    "Reason": "2-fluorobenzotrifluoride has a melting point of -109.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 3 fluorines) = 45 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the 2-fluorobenzotrifluoride structure creates a more rigid and planar structure, which can also contribute to a higher melting point.",
