    "Reason": "1-benzyl-3-phenyl-2-(phenylhydrazono)propylidene and 2-phenylhydrazine have different functional groups, which will affect their melting point: The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1-benzyl-3-phenyl-2-(phenylhydrazono)propylidene and 2-phenylhydrazine will affect their melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1) adds approximately +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The hydrazono group (Nc1ccccc1)=C(Cc1ccccc1)C(=NNc1ccccc1) adds approximately +30 due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
