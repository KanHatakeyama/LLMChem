    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the ethoxy group (\u2013OCH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The ethyl group also adds to the molecular weight and volume, further contributing to the melting point. The carbonyl group introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
