    "Reason": "Tryptamine is a simple molecule with a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) generally increases the melting point due to the increased electronegativity and dipole moment, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group (-CH3) can also contribute to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and volume, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
