    "Reason": "1-amino-decan-1-ylamine has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of a nitrogen atom introduces a rigid structure, increasing molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C. The decyl group introduces a hydrophobic effect, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The decan-1-amine group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of two additional methyl groups reduces the melting point due to the decrease in molecular weight and the loss of a hydrogen bonding potential, approximately -10\u00b0C.",
