    "Reason": "1-propanone has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a 4-chlorophenyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The chlorine atom can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
