    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The anthracene base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of two additional fused aromatic rings, which increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
