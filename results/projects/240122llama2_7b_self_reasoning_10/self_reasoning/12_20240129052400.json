    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The phenoxy group introduces additional pi-pi interactions, which can further increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
