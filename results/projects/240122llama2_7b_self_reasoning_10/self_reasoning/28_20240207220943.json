    "Reason": "1H-carbazole has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The carbazole structure introduces two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the tetrahydro-functionality introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
