    "Reason": "4-methyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The sulfonamide group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
