    "Reason": "1,6-Diisocyanatohexane has a melting point of -100.0\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered hexamethylene (with a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C) because the isocyanate group introduces a rigid structure and a high melting point. The isocyanate group itself can contribute around +20\u00b0C due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular rigidity. The hexamethylene chain adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to its increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
