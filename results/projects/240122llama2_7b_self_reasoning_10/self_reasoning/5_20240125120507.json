    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. Chlorohydroquinone has a melting point that is significantly higher due to the presence of a chlorine atom, which increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity and the ability to form hydrogen bonds. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 1 chlorine) = 10 degrees Celsius.",
