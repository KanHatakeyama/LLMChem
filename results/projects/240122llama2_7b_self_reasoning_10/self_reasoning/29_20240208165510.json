    "Reason": "1-Methylpropyl: The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to the strong electronegativity which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The propanamide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The presence of three fluorine substituents increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity which raises the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
