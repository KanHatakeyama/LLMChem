    "Reason": "5-Morpholinyl is a bulky group which adds significant rigidity to the structure, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The nitro group is also a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the morpholinyl base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
