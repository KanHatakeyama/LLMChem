    "Reason": "1,1'-Quadrane has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group, a nitrogen atom, and two additional fused aromatic rings. The methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The nitrogen atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point. The additional fused aromatic rings enhance the crystalline structure and increase the molecular weight, which generally raises the melting point. The net effect should be a complex interplay between these structural modifications.",
