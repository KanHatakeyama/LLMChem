    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius. The benzene ring formation introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
