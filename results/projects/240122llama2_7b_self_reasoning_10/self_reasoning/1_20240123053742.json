    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of multiple nitro groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the methyl groups tend to lower the melting point compared to a benzene base, as they create a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Trimethylbenzene base (-100\u00b0C), three nitro groups (+30\u00b0C), and three methyl groups (-30\u00b0C).",
