    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The nitro group can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group in the base molecule has a melting point of approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups in the compound (3-nitrophenyl)[(5E)-4-phenyl-5-(phenylhydrazono)-4,5-dihydro-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]methanone can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The hydrazono group can also contribute to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C. The thiadiazole ring can also participate in dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +30\u00b0C.",
