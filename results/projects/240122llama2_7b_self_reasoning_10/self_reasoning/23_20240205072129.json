    "Reason": "1-propanone has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of a 4-chlorophenyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
