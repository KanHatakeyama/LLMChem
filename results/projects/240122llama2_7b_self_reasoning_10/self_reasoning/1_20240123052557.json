    "Reason": "9-bromofluorene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is fluorene, which has a melting point of 105\u00b0C. The bromine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules. The fluorine atom also increases the melting point due to its electronegativity and the formation of hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules. The presence of these functional groups can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
