    "Reason": "Xanthene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a melting point of 100-105\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be anthracene, which has a melting point of 100.5\u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in xanthene will affect its melting point: (1) The additional benzene ring (c1ccc2c(c1)C) adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The oxygen atom (O2) can form hydrogen bonds with the aromatic rings, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
