    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a 2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl group. This functional group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, increasing the melting point. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can also contribute to the melting point. The exact impact of these modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the hydroxyl group as approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased hydrogen bonding and the rigid structure of the methyl group as approximately +10\u00b0C.",
