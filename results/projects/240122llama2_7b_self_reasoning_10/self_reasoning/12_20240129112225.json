    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The indole ring introduces pi-pi interactions and rigidity, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
