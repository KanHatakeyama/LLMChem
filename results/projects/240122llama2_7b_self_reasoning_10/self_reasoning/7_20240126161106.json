    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The stilbene ring introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C each, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
