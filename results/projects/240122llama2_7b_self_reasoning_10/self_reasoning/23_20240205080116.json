    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is succinic acid, which has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius each. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to the melting point.",
