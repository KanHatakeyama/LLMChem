    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.
