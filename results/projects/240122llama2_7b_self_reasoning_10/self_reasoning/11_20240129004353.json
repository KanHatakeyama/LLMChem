    "Reason": "1,1'-propane, 3-methyl- (base) has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group can contribute approximately +10 to +20 degrees Celsius.",
