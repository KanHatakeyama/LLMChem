    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl sulfone group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The phenyl group contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
