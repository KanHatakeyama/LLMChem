    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of 10.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The chlorine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each chlorine atom can be estimated to add approximately +5 to +10\u00b0C. Additionally, the pyridine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
