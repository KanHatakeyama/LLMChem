    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit we can compare to is 2-methylanisole, which has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-chloro-2-methylanisole will affect its melting point: (1) The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C.",
