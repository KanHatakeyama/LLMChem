    "Reason": "3-fluoro-4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
