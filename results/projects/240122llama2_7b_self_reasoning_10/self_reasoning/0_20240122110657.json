    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the tert-butyl group (C(C)C) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the acrylate group (C(=O)C=C) is a polar functional group that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. Taking the effect of the tert-butyl group and the acrylate group into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size and hydrogen bonding.",
