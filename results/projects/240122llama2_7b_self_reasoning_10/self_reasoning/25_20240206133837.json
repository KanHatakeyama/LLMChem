    "Reason": "2-Ethyloxirane has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison is ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two fluorine substituents significantly increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 2 fluorines) = 30 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
