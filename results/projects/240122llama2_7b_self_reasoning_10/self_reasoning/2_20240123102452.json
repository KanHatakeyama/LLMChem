    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene (cis) has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its basic unit, ethene, which has a melting point of -169.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two chlorine atoms can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +50 degrees Celsius. The cis configuration can also contribute to the rigidity of the molecular structure, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
