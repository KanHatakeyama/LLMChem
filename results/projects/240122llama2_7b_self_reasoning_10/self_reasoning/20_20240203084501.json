    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 \u00b0C. The azide group introduces a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
