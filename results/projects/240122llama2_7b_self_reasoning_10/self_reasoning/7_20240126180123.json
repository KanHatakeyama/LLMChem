    "Reason": "2-Ethyloxirane has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion can augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point. Additionally, the ethyloxirane moiety introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
