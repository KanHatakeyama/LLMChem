    "Reason": "1,1-Benzyl and phenyl groups are known to increase the melting point due to their rigidity and molecular weight. The presence of two phenyl groups can contribute approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The benzyl group can also add approximately +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The hydrazine group can also contribute to the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, approximately +20. The presence of two phenyl groups and the benzyl group can increase the melting point due to their rigidity and molecular weight.",
