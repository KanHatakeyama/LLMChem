    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in hexamethylene diisocyanate will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The isocyanate group (O=C=N/CCCCCCN=C=O) introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
