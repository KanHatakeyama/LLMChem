    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methylanisole, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius.",
