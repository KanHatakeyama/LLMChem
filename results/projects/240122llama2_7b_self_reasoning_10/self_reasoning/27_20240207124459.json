    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit we can compare to is the phenyl group, which has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl sulfone group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
