    "Reason": "1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit is propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 \u00b0C. The presence of two bromine atoms increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C each. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The bromine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C each.",
