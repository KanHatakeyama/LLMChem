    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole has a melting point of 116.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, thiadiazole, has a melting point of 116.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +50\u00b0C. The tryptamine base has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group tends to lower the melting point compared to the base due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can lower it by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Thiadiazole base +116.0, nitro group -10.0.",
