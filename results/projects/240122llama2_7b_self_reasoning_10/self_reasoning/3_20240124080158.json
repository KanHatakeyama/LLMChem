    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. 2. The compound has a phenyl group, which increases the melting point due to pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. 3. The presence of a benzyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance the crystalline structure and increase molecular weight. The benzyl group may add around +20 to +30\u00b0C. 4. The hydrazono group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point by around -10 to -20\u00b0C. 5. The propylidene group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance the crystalline structure and increase molecular weight. The propylidene group may add around +10 to +20\u00b0C.",
