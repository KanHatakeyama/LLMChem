    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C). Additionally, the decyl group (C1ccc(cc1)CCCCCCCCCC) adds approximately +20 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methyl group (C) adds approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
