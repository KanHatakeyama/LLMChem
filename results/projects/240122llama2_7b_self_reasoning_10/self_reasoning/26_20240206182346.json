    "Reason": "5-Furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is furfuryl, which has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The isopropyl group (C(C)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +10. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The methyl group (C(=O)C(=O)C(=O)C1CCCC1) adds a rigid structure and molecular weight, estimated at +5. The carbonyl group (C=O) adds a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +2. The isopropyl group (C(C)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +5. The furanyl group (C2(C)C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +5. The ether linkage (C1CCCC1) adds a rigid structure and molecular weight, estimated at +2. The net effect is a complex interplay of structural features, with some increasing the melting point and others decreasing it.",
