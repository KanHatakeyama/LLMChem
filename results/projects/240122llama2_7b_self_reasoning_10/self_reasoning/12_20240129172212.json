    "Reason": "1-propene, 1-chloro-, (z)- has a melting point that we can compare to 1-propene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which raises it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The (z)-configuration also contributes to a more rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
