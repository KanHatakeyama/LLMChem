    "Reason": "2-chlorophenoxyethylamine is a compound with a basic unit of ethylamine, which has a melting point of -11.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to increased electronegativity and increased intermolecular interactions. The phenoxy group also increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The net effect of these functional groups is an estimated increase in melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius.",
