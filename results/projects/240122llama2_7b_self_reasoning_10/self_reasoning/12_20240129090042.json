    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The ethyl group (C1(CCCC)CC) introduces a rigid structure, contributing approximately +5 due to the increased molecular volume and van der Waals interactions; (4) The carbonyl group (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CCCC)) raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and the increase in molecular weight. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
