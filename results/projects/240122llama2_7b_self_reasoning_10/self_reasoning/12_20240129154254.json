    "Reason": "2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl alcohol has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of three additional phenyl groups and a methyl group. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can add approximately +5 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
