    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point that we can estimate by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of around -5 degrees Celsius. (2) The butyl and ethyl groups can each add approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact.",
