    "Reason": "1,3-Butadiene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethene (with a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C). The introduction of a bromine atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the bromine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. The exact effect depends on the specific compound and the degree of pi-stacking. For 1,3-butadiene, the bromine atom can participate in pi-stacking interactions, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The bromine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to both molecular size and pi-stacking interactions.",
