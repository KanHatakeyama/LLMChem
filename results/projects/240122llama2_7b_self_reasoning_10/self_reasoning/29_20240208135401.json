    "Reason": "1,12-diaminododecane has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is n-dodecane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the two nitrogen atoms within the diamine structure can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional methyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the phenyl group, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius.",
