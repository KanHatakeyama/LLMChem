    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-cyanopyridine has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a bromine atom, which increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the cyano group, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the pyridine ring introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
