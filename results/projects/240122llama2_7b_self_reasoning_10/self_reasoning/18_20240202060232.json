    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C.",
