    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The presence of three hydroxyl groups increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and molecular weight. Each hydroxyl group might contribute around +10 to +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5 to +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and create a rigid structure, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
