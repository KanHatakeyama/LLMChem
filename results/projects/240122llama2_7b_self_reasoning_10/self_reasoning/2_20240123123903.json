    "Reason": "1,1'-Physostigmine has a melting point of 106.5\u00b0C. The basic unit is the benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications include two fused aromatic rings, which increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. Each additional fused ring can be estimated to add approximately +25\u00b0C. Additionally, the molecule contains a tertiary amine group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C.",
