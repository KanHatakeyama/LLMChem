    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. Ethoxy groups are known to increase the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and enhance the crystalline structure. Each ethoxy group can be estimated to add approximately 20 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. Additionally, the acetate group can contribute around +20 to +30 degrees Celsius due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and enhance the crystalline structure.",
