    "Reason": "3,3'-Thiodipropionic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is the propionic acid moiety, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The thio group introduces additional rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.
