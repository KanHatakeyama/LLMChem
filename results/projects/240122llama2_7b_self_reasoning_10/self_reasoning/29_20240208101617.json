    "Reason": "1-proline, 1-acetyl-4-hydroxy-, trans has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be the 1-proline base, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The acetyl group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group also introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -10 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methoxy group can also reduce the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -10 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
