    "Reason": "2-dimethylaminoethyl groups can increase the melting point due to the presence of two additional phenyl rings, which can enhance pi-pi interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each additional phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the amino group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can further lower the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
