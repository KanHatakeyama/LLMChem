    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound can be considered hexane, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The presence of a formate group can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The hexyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
