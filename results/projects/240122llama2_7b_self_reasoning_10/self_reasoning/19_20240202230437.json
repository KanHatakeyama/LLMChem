    "Reason": "1-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid has a melting point that we can compare to pyrrole, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
