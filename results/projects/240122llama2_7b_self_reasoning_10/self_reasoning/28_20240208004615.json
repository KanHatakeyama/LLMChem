    "Reason": "1,1'-Physostigmine has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is physostigmine itself, which has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Additionally, the moramide group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the moramide group, estimated at +5\u00b0C each.",
