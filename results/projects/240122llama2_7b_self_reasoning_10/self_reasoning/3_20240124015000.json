    "Reason": "1,1'-Physostigmine has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be physostigmine, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl group and a methoxy group. The phenyl group can increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, while the methoxy group can add approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding.",
