    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane has a melting point of -118.5\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which generally raises the melting point. The fluorine atom also introduces a dipole moment, which can increase the intermolecular forces and melting point. The exact impact of the fluorine atom is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the increase due to the fluorine atom as a rough estimate. The fluorine atom introduces a dipole moment of approximately +10.0 D, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
