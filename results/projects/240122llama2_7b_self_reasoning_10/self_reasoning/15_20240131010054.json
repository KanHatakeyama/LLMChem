The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.
