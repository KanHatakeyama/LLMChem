    "Reason": "The basic unit, hexane, has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an acetate group increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The acetate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point. However, the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces dominate, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
