    "Reason": "1E-N,N'-bis(4-methylphenyl)-2-[(4-methylphenyl)amino]ethanimidamide has a melting point that can be analyzed by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethanimidamide, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The methylphenyl group (C1CCCC1) adds approximately +20 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The 4-methylphenyl group (C1CCCC1) adds approximately +20 due to adding more rigidity to the structure. The amino group (N) adds approximately +10 due to the presence of a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The methyl group (C) adds approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
