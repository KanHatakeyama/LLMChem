    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of four fused aromatic rings introduces significant rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, which can raise the melting point by approximately +100 degrees Celsius. Each additional phenyl group can contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and pi-stacking interactions. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point of -106 degrees Celsius.",
