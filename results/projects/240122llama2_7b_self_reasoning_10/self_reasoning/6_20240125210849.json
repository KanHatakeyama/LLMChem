    "Reason": "1,3-dodecanediamine has a melting point of around -10.5\u00b0C. The basic unit we can compare to is n-dodecane, which has a melting point of -10.5\u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in tri-n-dodecylamine will affect its melting point: (1) The three dodecyl groups add approximately +30 due to increasing molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; (2) The amine group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C; (3) The presence of three methyl groups reduces the melting point by approximately -5\u00b0C due to their small size and limited ability to participate in hydrogen bonding. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
