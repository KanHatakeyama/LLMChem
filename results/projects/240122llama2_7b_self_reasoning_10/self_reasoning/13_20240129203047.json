    "Reason": "3-methylquinoline n-oxide has a melting point that we can compare to quinoline, which has a melting point of 106.5 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point. The methyl group also introduces a rigid structure, which raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The effects are additive.",
