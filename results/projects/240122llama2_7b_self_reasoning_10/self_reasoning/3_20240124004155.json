    "Reason": "1-chloropropane has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant increase in melting point due to the strong electronegativity and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, which can add around +10\u00b0C.",
