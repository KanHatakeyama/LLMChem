    "Reason": "1,1'-Terphenyl base, with a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups in hesperetine will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; (2) The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +40 degrees Celsius; (3) The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius; (4) The ether linkage reduces the melting point by approximately -2 degrees Celsius due to decreased hydrogen bonding potential; (5) The thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +70 degrees Celsius.",
