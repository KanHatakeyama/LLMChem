    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components: (1) The cyclohexene ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. (2) The carboxylic acid and anhydride functionalities introduce a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C each. (3) The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C each.",
