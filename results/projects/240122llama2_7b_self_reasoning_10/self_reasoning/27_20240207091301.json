    "Reason": "2-{[(pyridin-2-ylamino)methyl]amino}naphthalene-1,4-dione has a melting point that we can compare to naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2-{[(pyridin-2-ylamino)methyl]amino}naphthalene-1,4-dione will affect its melting point: (1) The pyridine ring (NCNc2[nH0]cccc2) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20; (2) The amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +10; (3) The methylamino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +5; (4) The naphthalene ring (C2ccccc12) adds more rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
