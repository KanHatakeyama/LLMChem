    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with two fused aromatic rings, which increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The hydrogen chloride can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C.",
