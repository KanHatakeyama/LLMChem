    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be succinic acid, which has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each bromine is estimated to raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the carboxyl group introduces a polar carbonyl-like functionalities, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
