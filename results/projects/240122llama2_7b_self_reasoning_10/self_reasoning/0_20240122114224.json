    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene has a melting point of -105.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of resonance. The methyl group (-CH3) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of electronegative atoms. The diethyl group (-CH2CH2-) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of hydrogen bonding. The net effect of these groups is an increase in the melting point.",
