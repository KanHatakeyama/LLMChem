    "Reason": "1,6-hexanediol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The hexyl group introduces additional molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
