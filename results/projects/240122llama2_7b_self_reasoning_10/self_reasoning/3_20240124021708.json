    "Reason": "1,3-dodecanediamine has a melting point of -10.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of three dodecyl groups (C12H25) in the structure increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The dodecyl groups also create a more rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two amine groups can also contribute to the melting point, as they can participate in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
