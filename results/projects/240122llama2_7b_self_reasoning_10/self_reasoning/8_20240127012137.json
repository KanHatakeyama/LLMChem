    "Reason": "4-n-propylbenzenesulfonyl chloride has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a propyl group (C3H7) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the sulfonyl group (\u2013SO2\u2013) introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, lowering the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The chlorine atom (Cl) also introduces a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. Summing these changes: Benzene base (5.5\u00b0C), propyl group (C3H7) (20\u00b0C), and sulfonyl group (\u2013SO2\u2013) (\u201310\u00b0C), and chlorine atom (Cl) (5\u00b0C).",
