    "Reason": "1-proline, 1-acetyl-4-hydroxy-, trans- has a melting point that can be analyzed by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is glycine, which has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1-proline, 1-acetyl-4-hydroxy-, trans- will affect its melting point: (1) The acetyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. (2) The hydroxyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. (3) The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
