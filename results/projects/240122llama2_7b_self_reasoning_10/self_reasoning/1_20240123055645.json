    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrafluorobenzene has a melting point of -11.2\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and electronegativity, which can lead to a higher melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and dipole-dipole interactions. The presence of four fluorine atoms can raise the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C.",
