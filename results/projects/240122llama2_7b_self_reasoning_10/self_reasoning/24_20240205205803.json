    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a bromine atom increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. However, the fluorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity of the structure, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Ethane base (-172.0\u00b0C), one bromine atom (+10\u00b0C), and four fluorine atoms (+10\u00b0C).",
