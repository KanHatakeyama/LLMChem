    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point: 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Additionally, the trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to its small size and limited ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The propan-1-imine base introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
