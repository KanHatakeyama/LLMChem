    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for this compound can be cyanuric acid, which has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The hydroxyl groups in this compound increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The ethyl group also contributes to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of three hydroxyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +30\u00b0C each.",
