    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius each. The naphthalene ring formation introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-pi interactions. Additionally, the methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
