    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the benzene ring introduces a rigid structure, which might raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
