    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of phenol, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we need to account for the functional groups present:\n- Two nitro groups: These functional groups significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to participate in dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding. Each nitro group may contribute around +50 to +70\u00b0C.\n- Two dinitro groups: These functional groups also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding. Each dinitro group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.\n- Amino group: The amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20 to +30\u00b0C.\n- Two phenol groups: The two phenol groups can contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and form a rigid structure. Each phenol group may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C.\nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to phenol's melting point: +60 to +80\u00b0C for the nitro and dinitro groups, +20 to +30\u00b0C for the amino group, and +20 to +30\u00b0C for each phenol group.",
