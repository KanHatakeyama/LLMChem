    "Reason": "1,2-Naphthaleneacetonitrile has a melting point that we can compare to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of the naphthalene ring introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for this structural modification. The acetonitrile group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The naphthalene ring itself introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70 \u00b0C.",
