    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two carbonyl groups, which generally increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, raising it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The hydrogen bonding potential is lower due to the hydrogen atoms being part of a four-membered ring, reducing it by approximately -5\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), one chlorine atom (+10\u00b0C), and one hydrogen atom (-5\u00b0C).",
