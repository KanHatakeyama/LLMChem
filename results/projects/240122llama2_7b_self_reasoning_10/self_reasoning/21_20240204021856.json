    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity. The phenyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
