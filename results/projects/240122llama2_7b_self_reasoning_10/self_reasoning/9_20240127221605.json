    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of six methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point by approximately +60\u00b0C. Additionally, the isocyanate group introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
