    "Reason": "1-propanol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can form hydrogen bonds and increase the melting point. The methyl group also introduces a bulky structure, which can increase the melting point due to steric hindrance. The net effect is a complex interplay of structural components, with the methyl group contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius, the acetate group contributing approximately +20 degrees Celsius, and the bulky methyl group contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
