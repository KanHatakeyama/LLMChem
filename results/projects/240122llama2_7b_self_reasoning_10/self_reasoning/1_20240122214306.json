    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The methoxy groups (\u2013O\u2013) increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +10 \u00b0C each. The iodine atom (I) can also contribute to the melting point due to its electronegativity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at +5 \u00b0C.",
