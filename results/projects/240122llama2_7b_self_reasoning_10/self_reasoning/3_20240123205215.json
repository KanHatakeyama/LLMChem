    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the oxygen within the methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) also increases hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in propanediol, the additional oxygen atom allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methoxy group into consideration, we can predict a decrease due to the additional hydrogen bonding potential. However, the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, which should raise the melting point. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
