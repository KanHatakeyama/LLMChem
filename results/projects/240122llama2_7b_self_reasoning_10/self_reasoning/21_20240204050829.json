    "Reason": "2-Ethyloxirane has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of ethane, which is around -114.0\u00b0C. The presence of two ethyl groups can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
