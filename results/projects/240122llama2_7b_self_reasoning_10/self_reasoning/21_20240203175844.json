    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The indole ring itself adds rigidity and pi-system interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. The ether linkage reduces the melting point by approximately -2 \u00b0C due to reduced hydrogen bonding potential. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to the melting point.",
