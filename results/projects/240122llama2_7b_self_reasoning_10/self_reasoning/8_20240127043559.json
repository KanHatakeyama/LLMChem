    "Reason": "4-methyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The functional groups in this compound contribute to the melting point as follows:\n- Methyl group: The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.\n- Nitro group: The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group, which introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.\n- Sulfonamide group: The sulfonamide group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.\n- Sulfur atom: The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.\nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +60 to +70\u00b0C for the methyl group, +50 to +60\u00b0C for the nitro group, +20 to +30\u00b0C for the sulfonamide group, and +5 to +10\u00b0C for the sulfur atom.",
