    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. Additionally, the lauramide structure introduces a rigid, hydrophobic structure with increased molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point. The exact impact of these structural features is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
