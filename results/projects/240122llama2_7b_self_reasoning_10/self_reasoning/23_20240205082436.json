    "Reason": "1,3-Thiazole ring: The presence of a 1,3-thiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one phenyl group, we have +20\u00b0C total (less influence due to the complex structure), one chlorine atom at +50\u00b0C, and one methyl group at +5\u00b0C.",
