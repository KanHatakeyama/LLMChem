    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the tert-butyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The acrylate group (\u2013CO\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular rigidity. The tert-butyl group can also participate in dipole interactions, which can further contribute to the melting point. The net effect should be a raised melting point due to the combination of molecular size, hydrogen bonding, and dipole interactions.",
