    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: The basic unit for comparison can be succinic acid, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius for each bromine atom. The carboxyl group introduces a polar carbonyl-like functionalities, which might raise the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
