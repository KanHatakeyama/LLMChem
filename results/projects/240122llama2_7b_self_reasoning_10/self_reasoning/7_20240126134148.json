    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol has a melting point of -120.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a m-bromobenzoic acid moiety. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and electronegativity, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the carboxylic acid group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may further contribute to the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The m-bromobenzoic acid moiety can also enhance the crystalline structure and increase the molecular weight, which may add approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
