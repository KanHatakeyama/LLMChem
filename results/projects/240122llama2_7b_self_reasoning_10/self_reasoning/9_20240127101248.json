    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a melting point of -95.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two dimethylamino groups (\u2013N(CH3)2) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) in place of a hydrogen atom also increases the molecular weight and size, which further raises the melting point. The dimethylamino group introduces two additional hydrogen bonding potentials, which can further lower the melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
