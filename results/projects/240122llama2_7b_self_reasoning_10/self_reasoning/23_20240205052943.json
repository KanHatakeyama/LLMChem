    "Reason": "1,1'-Angelic acid has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
