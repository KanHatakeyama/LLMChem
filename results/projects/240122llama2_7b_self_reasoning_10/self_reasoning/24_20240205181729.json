    "Reason": "1,1,1,3,3,3-hexadeutero-2-propanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-propanone, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The presence of six deuterium atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
