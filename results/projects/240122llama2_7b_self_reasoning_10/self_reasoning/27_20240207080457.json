    "Reason": "106 degrees Celsius is the melting point of sulfur. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of one sulfur atom. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point.",
