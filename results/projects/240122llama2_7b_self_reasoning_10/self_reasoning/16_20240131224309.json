    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The alcohol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the melting point by approximately -5\u00b0C due to steric hindrance.",
