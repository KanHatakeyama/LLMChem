    "Reason": "2-amino-3,5-dimethylphenyl and phenyl groups are known to increase the melting point due to their rigid structure and molecular weight. The presence of two phenyl groups can contribute to an increase of approximately +20\u00b0C each, totaling +40\u00b0C. The amino group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to their molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
