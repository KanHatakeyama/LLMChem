    "Reason": "2-pyrrolidinyl substitution tends to increase the melting point compared to a phenolic base, as it creates a more rigid structure with a higher melting point. The pyrrolidinyl group introduces additional rigidity, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
