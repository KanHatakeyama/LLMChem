    "Reason": "1-phenylcyclohexanol has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is cyclohexanol, which has a melting point around 50\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The cyclohexane ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C.",
