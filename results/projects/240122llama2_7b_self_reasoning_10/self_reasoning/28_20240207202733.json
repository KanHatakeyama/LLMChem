    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of two phenyl groups and four amino groups increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 \u00b0C per group, totaling +80 \u00b0C. The amino groups also contribute to hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the phenyl group, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each methoxy group.",
