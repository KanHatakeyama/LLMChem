    "Reason": "1,3,4-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The hydrazono-functionalities and thiadiazole ring introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
