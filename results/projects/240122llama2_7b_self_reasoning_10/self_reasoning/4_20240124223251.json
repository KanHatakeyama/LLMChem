    "Reason": "2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)phenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit is phenol, which has a melting point of around 95 degrees Celsius. (2) The pyrrolidinyl group introduces a rigid structure with a melting point increase of approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. (3) The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduced molecular weight and decreased hydrogen bonding potential.",
