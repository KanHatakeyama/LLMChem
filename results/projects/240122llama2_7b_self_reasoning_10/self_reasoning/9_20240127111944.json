    "Reason": "1-methylcyclohexane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be cyclohexane, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom reduces the molecular weight and size, which generally lowers the melting point. However, the additional functional group introduces a new hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point. Taking the effect of the methyl group into consideration, we can predict a decreased melting point but not as low as the decrease observed with cyclohexane's hydrogen bonding alone.",
