    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, propanediol, has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can form hydrogen bonds, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The acetamide group can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
