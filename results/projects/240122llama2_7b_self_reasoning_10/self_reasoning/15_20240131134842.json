    "Reason": "1,1'-biphenyl has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups and a dioxane-like bridging moiety can contribute to an increase in molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius for each additional phenyl group and +5 degrees Celsius for the dioxane-like bridging moiety. Additionally, the acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
