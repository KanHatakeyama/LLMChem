    "Reason": "1,2-Diphenylhydroxylamine has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be phenol, which has a melting point of -12.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups significantly increases the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the hydroxylamine group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can further contribute to the melting point. The exact impact of this functional group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect as roughly +10 to +20 degrees Celsius.",
