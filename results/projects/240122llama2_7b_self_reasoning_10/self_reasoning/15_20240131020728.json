    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
