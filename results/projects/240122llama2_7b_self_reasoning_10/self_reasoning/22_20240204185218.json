    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of ethane (ethene) which is -172.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be cis-2-pentene, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl groups also increase the crystal lattice stability, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
