    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the chlorine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
