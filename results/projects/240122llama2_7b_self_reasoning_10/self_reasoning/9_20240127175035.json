    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point around 92 degrees Celsius. Naproanilide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. Naproanilide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to naphthalene, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Naphthalene base (+95\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C).",
