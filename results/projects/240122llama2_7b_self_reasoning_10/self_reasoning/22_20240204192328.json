    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, based on the fact that piperazine itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group also introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a more rigid structure and additional molecular weight, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
