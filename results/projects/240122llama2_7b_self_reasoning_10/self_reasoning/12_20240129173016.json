    "Reason": "1-benzyl-3-phenyl-2-(phenylhydrazono)propylidene and 2-phenylhydrazine have different functional groups, which will affect their melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a phenyl group in both the propylidene and hydrazone rings increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups in the hydrazone ring also increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius.",
