    "Reason": "3,3,3-trifluoro-N-(1-methylpropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +5\u00b0C per atom. The nitrogen atom introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C.",
