    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which might raise the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which might raise the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which might raise the melting point by about +2 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
