    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit is imidazole, which has a melting point of -15.0 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups, such as the methyl and ethyl groups, contribute to the melting point through increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius each.",
