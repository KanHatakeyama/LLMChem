    "Reason": "1,1'-Spiro-2-benzopyran has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a methoxy group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute around +20\u00b0C.",
