    "Reason": "1,3,4-Oxadiazole ring: The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly enhances the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the naphthyl groups introduce a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The oxadiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +20\u00b0C.",
