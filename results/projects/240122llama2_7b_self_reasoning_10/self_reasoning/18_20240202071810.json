    "Reason": "3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group (\u2013F\u2013F\u2013F) adds rigidity and molecular weight, increasing the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The phenyl group (C1=CC=CC=C1) introduces pi-pi interactions and rigidity, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The carboxy group (C(=O)O) introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group (C(F)(F)F) adds a bulky side chain, reducing the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to steric hindrance. The fluorine atoms increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 3 fluorines) = 45 degrees Celsius.",
