    "Reason": "1-acetyl-2-phenylhydrazino group introduces a rigid structure with a melting point increase of approximately +20\u00b0C due to the additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The phenyl group in the acetamide moiety contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The hydrazono group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups in the molecule raises the melting point.",
