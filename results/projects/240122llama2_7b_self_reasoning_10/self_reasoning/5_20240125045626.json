    "Reason": "1,3-Butadiene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and rigidity, which raises the melting point. The bromine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential.",
