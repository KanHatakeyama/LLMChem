    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro functional group (\u2013NO2) can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) can also contribute to the melting point, although its effect is less significant than the nitro group, estimated at around +2\u00b0C. The toluene ring itself can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
