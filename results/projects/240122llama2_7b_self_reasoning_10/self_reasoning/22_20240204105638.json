    "Reason": "5-methylbenzoxazole has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The oxazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C.",
