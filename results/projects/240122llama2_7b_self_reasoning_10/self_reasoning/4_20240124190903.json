    "Reason": "1,1'-Phentenyl benzoate has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a phenyl group (\u2013Oc1ccccc1) increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Additionally, the benzoate group (\u2013COO\u2013) introduces a carboxylate group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, further lowering the melting point. The net effect should be a decreased melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding.",
