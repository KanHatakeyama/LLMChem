    "Reason": "3,5-dichlorophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is phenol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
