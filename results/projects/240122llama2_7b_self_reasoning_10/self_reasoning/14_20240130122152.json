    "Reason": "2-Methylcyclopentanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentane, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of the methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. Additionally, the methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group also introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at approximately +2\u00b0C.",
