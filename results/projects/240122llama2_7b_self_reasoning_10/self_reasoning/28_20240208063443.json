    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methyl group, let's say it raises it by +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
