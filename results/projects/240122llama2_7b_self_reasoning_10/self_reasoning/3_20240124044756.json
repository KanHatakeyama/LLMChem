    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbazole has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a carbazole ring. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The carbazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius.",
