    "Reason": "3',5'-dimethoxyacetophenone has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is acetophenone, which has a melting point of around 30\u00b0C. The methoxy groups (three in total) increase the melting point due to additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C each.",
