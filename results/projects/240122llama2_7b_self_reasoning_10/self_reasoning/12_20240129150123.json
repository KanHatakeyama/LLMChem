    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl and ethyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the sulfur within the sulfide group reduces the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of a rigid structure. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with propane's hydrogen bonding alone.",
