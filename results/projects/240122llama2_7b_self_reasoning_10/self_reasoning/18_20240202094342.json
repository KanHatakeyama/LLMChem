    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of ethanol, which is around -114.1 degrees Celsius. The ethoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can sterically hinder the crystal lattice, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
