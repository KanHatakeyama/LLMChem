    "Reason": "1-oxoindane has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The basic unit is a fused aromatic ring, which increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. Each additional fused ring can add approximately +25\u00b0C. Additionally, the carboxylic acid group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
