    "Reason": "1,1-propanediamine has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and two additional phenyl rings. The hydroxyl group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and a slight increase in molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The additional phenyl groups contribute to an increase in molecular weight and pi-pi interactions, estimated at approximately +100 degrees Celsius each.",
