    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered a phenyl methyl sulfone, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and a slight increase in molecular weight, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
