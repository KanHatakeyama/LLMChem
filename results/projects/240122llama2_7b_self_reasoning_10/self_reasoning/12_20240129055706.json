    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point around 100 \u00b0C. The presence of three hydroxyl groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +30 \u00b0C per group. The ethyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, contributing approximately +5 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +40 \u00b0C.
