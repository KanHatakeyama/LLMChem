    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of 10.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of five chlorine atoms increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the pyridine ring, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C for each chlorine atom. The chlorine atoms also increase the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the pyridine ring, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C for each chlorine atom.",
