    "Reason": "4-Methyl-piperidine has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1-methyl-piperidine, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-methyl-piperidine will affect its melting point: (1) The phenylmethyl group (C2CCNCC2) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius; (2) The piperidine ring (c1ccccc1) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
