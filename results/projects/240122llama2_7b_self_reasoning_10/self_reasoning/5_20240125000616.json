    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the fluorine atoms also increase the electronegativity and polarizability, which can lead to stronger intermolecular interactions and a higher melting point. The net effect is a more significant increase due to the larger molecular size and stronger intermolecular interactions.",
