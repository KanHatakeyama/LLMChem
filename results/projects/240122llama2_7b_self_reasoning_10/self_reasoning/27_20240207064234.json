    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base melting point around 106\u00b0C. The xanthene structure introduces two additional fused aromatic rings, which significantly increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The molecular structure also includes two methoxy groups; each can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each ether. Additionally, the dioxane-like bridging moiety raises the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
