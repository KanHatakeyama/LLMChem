    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit of analysis is the imidazole ring, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius due to its rigidity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. The phenyl group can increase the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius.",
