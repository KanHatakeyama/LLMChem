    "Reason": "1-propanol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The propyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius.",
