    "Reason": "4-methyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro group (NO2) is known to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The sulfonamide group (SO3H) also contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding. The methyl group (CH3) can lower the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces and decreased crystal lattice stability. The 4-methyl substitution can also lower the melting point compared to 3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability.",
