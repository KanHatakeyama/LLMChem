    "Reason": "2-methylphenyl group has a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C, which is due to the presence of a benzene ring and the methyl group. The N-methyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C, as it creates a more rigid structure and enhances the hydrogen bonding potential. The N-phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point, as it can form additional hydrogen bonds and increase the molecular weight. The presence of two phenyl groups can also increase the melting point due to the potential for pi-pi interactions and the rigidity of the structure.",
