    "Reason": "1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of four chlorine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 4 chlorines) = 60 degrees Celsius.",
