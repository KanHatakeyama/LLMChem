    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyl additives can increase the melting point due to the formation of a rigid structure and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and further increase the melting point. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and rigidity. The exact impact of these structural modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the carbonyl group and the phenyl group separately. The carbonyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C due to the formation of a rigid structure and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and rigidity. The exact impact of the phenyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the effect of the phenyl group by considering its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and rigidity. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 \u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity.",
