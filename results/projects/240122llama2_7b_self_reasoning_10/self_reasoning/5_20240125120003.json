    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The chloromethyl group introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The two chlorine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their high electronegativity, raising it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each.",
