    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The stilbene ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for one nitro group and one stilbene ring, we have +50\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure) and +70\u00b0C total (including the effect of additional rigid structures).",
