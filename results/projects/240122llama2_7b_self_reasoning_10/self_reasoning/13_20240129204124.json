    "Reason": "1,1-Thiabenzene base: The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which raises the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group also introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C. The thiabenzene ring introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
