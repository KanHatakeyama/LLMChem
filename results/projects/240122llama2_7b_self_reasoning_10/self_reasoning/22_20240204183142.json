The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The ether linkage introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +2\u00b0C.",
