    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The basic unit for this compound is 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the hydroxylamine group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C for each methoxy group.",
