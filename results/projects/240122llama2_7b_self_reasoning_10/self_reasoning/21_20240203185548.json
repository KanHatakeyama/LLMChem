    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may add roughly +20 due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The basic unit we can compare to is butane, which has a melting point of -10.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in methyl isobutyrylacetate will affect its melting point: (1) The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can add approximately +5 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (2) The isobutyryl group introduces a more rigid structure, which can add approximately +5 due to increasing the molecular volume and steric hindrance.",
