    "Reason": "2-ethylhexylacetate has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit, ethyl acetate, has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2-ethylhexylacetate will affect its melting point: (2) The two additional phenyl groups can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (3) The two additional methyl groups can add approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
