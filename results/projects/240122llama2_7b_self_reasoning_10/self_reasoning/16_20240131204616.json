    "Reason": "1-Aspartic acid base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that aspartic acid itself has a melting point around that value. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The aspartic acid group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methoxy group can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces but will also reduce it due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
