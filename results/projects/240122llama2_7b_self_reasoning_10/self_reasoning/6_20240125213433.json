    "Reason": "5-chloro-2'-fluoro-2,3'-bipyridine has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The fluorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The bipyridine ring introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
