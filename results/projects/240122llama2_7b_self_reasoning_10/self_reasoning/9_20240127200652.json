    "Reason": "1,3-propanedisulfide has a melting point of around -100\u00b0C due to the presence of a rigid structure with a sulfur atom at the center, which increases molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The propyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The sulfur atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
