    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two fused aromatic rings, which significantly increase the melting point due to pi-stacking interactions and molecular rigidity. Each additional fused ring can add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. Additionally, the xanthene structure has two methoxy groups, which can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
