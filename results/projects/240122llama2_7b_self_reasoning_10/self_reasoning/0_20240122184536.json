    "Reason": "1R-3-oxoindane-1-carboxylic acid has a melting point of 100.5\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid functional group is a strong withdrawing group, which increases the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group on the alkyl chain also contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The indane ring itself has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C, which is influenced by the steric hindrance and conjugation of the ring.",
