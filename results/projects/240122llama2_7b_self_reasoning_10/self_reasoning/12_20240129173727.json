    "Reason": "3-(boc-amino)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is propionic acid, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The propionic acid moiety introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
