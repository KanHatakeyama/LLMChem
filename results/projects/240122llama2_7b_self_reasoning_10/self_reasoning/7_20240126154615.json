    "Reason": "1,1'-Dimethylnitramine has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group and a nitramide group. The methyl group adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The nitramide group introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
