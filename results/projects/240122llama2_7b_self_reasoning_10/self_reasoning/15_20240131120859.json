    "Reason": "4-Methoxybenzylidene group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The oxazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group within the oxazole ring can also increase the melting point due to additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
