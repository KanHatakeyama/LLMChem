    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be 2,6-diphenyl-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the carboxylic acid and its derivative introduce hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
