    "Reason": "3-(boc-amino)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is propionic acid, which has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The amino group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity and potential for dipole interactions, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenyl group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of three fused aromatic rings increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring.",
