    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius, based on the presence of two carbonyl groups, which can participate in dipole interactions and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius for each carbonyl. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. The methyl group (C1) introduces a small increase due to the additional molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius.",
