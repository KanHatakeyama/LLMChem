    "Reason": "1-aspartic acid has a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The aspartic acid group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can further raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methylene bridge can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
