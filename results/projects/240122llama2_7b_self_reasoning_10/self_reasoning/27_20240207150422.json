    "Reason": "2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl alcohol has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The methyl groups add approximately +10\u00b0C due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure and a diene conjugated system, which can contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The alcohol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
