    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by the functional groups in the molecule relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of three nitro groups significantly increases the melting point due to the strong dipole moment and hydrogen bonding potential. Each nitro group introduces approximately +50\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
