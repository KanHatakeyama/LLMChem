    "Reason": "3-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl isocyanate has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is phenyl, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The methoxycarbonyl group (\u2013O\u2013C(=O)\u2013) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The isocyanate group (\u2013N=C=O) also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The methoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The exact impact of each functional group can be estimated as follows:\n* Methoxycarbonyl group: +20\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications)\n* Isocyanate group: +20\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications)\n* Methoxy group: +10\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications)\n* Isocyanate group: +20\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications)\n\nAdding these contributions, we can estimate the melting point of 3-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl isocyanate: +60\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
