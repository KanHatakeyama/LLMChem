    "Reason": "1,2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The two phenyl groups contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which raises the melting point due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for two phenyl groups, we have +40\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +50\u00b0C, the tert-butyl group at +20\u00b0C, and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +70\u00b0C.",
