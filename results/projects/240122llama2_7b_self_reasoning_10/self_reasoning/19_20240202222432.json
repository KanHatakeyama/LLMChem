    "Reason": "1,3,4-Thiadiazole ring: The 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
