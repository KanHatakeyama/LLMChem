    "Reason": "4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The allyl group (Cc1ccc(cc1O)C) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The allyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
