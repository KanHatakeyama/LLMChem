    "Reason": "1,1'-biphenyl base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl rings, which would add approximately +20 degrees Celsius each, totaling +40 degrees Celsius. The diacetate group introduces two carbonyl functionalities, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The acetate group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
