    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide will affect its melting point: (a) The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. (b) The acetamide group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. (c) The azide group introduces a nitrogen with a high electronegativity, which can participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. (d) The benzene ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C.",
