    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a trichloromethyl group (\u2013ClC(Cl)Cl) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The chlorine atoms also participate in hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point. The acetamide group (\u2013OC(C)=O) introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which may slightly lower the melting point. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
