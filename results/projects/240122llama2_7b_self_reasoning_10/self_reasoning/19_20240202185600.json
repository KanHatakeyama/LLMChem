    "Reason": "2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of the 2,4-dichlorobenzene ring introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at +2 \u00b0C.",
