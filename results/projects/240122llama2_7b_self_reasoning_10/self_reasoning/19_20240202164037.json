    "Reason": "3-methyl-butyraldehyde oxime has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound can be 3-methyl-butyraldehyde, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The oxime group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +30 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, approximately -5 degrees Celsius.",
