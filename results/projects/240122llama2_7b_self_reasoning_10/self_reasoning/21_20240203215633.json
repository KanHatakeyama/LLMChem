    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, and two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +30 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius.",
