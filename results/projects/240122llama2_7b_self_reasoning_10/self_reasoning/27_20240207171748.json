    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered the propanone moiety, which has a melting point of -12 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +2 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
