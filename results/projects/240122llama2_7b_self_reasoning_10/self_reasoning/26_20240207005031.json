    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethene (with a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C). The introduction of two fluorine substituents significantly increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 2 fluorines) = 30 degrees Celsius.",
