    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl, which has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in prochlorperazine will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
