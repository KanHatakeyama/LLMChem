    "Reason": "5-chloro-2-methoxy-4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride contains a benzene ring with a sulfonyl group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point, as it increases the molecular weight and can participate in hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atom can also increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and the resulting increased molecular polarity.",
