    "Reason": "2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride has a basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The methoxy groups are known to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding capabilities. The chlorine atom also contributes to the melting point due to its electronegativity and the resulting dipole moment. The presence of the chlorine atom also increases the molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point.",
