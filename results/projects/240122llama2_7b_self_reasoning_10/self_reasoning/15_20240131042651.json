    "Reason": "3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which melts at 5.5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl ester group introduces a hydroxyl group, which raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding. The hydroxyl group can contribute around +10 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.
