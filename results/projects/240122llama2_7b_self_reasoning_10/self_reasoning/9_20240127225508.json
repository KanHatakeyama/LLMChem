    "Reason": "1E-N,N'-Bis(4-methylphenyl)-2-[(4-methylphenyl)amino]ethanimidamide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be ethanimidamide, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The methylphenyl group (\u2013CH3) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The 4-methylphenyl group (\u2013C(=C)\u2013CH3) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. The amino group (N\u2013C(=N)\u2013) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) adds approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The presence of two phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion raises the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
