    "Reason": "5-(4-morpholinyl)-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the basic unit of morpholine, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The nitro group can increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular rigidity, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The morpholine ring can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of the nitro group can also increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular rigidity, estimated at around +30\u00b0C.",
