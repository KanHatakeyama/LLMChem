    "Reason": "1,3-Butadiene has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The cyanogen group (N#CC#N) introduces a strong dipole, which increases intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two nitrogen atoms also enhances hydrogen bonding potential, which can further contribute to the melting point increase.",
