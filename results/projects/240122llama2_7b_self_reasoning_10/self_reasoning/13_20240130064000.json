    "Reason": "4-n-hexyloxyphenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 4-hexylphenol, which has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-n-hexyloxyphenol will affect its melting point: (1) The hexyl group (C(C)C) adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +10.",
