    "Reason": "1,1-Dimethylacetamide has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, acetamide, has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each methyl group is estimated to add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
