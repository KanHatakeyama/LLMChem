    "Reason": "1-Propyl substitution generally lowers the melting point compared to the base of ethanol due to reducing the crystal lattice stability. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
