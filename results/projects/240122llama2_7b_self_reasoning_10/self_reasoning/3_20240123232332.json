    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The butyl and ethyl groups can contribute to the melting point due to their increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius each. The carbonyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ethyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
