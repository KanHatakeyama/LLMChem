    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (106 degrees Celsius) with two carbonyl groups forming a rigid structure and increasing intermolecular interactions. Each carbonyl is estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the formation of a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius.",
