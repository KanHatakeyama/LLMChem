    "Reason": "1,2,4-Triazole compounds, such as tebuconazole, have a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for tebuconazole can be considered a 1,2,4-triazole ring, which introduces rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The molecular structure includes two phenyl groups, which add approximately +20\u00b0C due to increasing molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. Additionally, tebuconazole has a methyl group, which may raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The nitrogen atom also introduces a rigid structure, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C.",
