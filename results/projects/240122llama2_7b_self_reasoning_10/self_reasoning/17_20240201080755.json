    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 50 degrees Celsius. The anthrone structure introduces two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions and rigidity. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the anthrone structure has two methoxy groups, which can raise the melting point by approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
