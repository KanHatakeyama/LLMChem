    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups in 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl increases the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the molecular structure includes several functional groups and structural features that can impact the melting point: (1) Two carbonyl groups (one from the ketone and one from the ester) can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20 to +40 degrees Celsius for each carbonyl. (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group that can add about +10 degrees Celsius due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact. (4) The moramide group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
