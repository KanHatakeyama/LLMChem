    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
