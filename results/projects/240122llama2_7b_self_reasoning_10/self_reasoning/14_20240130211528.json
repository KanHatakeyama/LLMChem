    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of norgestimate, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the presence of a nitro group can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The carbamate group can also increase the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The presence of a dioxane-like bridging moiety can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
