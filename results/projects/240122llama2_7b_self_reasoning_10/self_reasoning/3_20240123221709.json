    "Reason": "1,2-furanyl groups can increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of two furanyl groups can contribute to the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. Additionally, the dioxime group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may add around +10\u00b0C.",
