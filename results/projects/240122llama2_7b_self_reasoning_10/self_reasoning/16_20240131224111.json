    "Reason": "1-phenylcyclohexanol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyclohexanol, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The cyclohexane ring also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
