    "Reason": "4-ethoxyphenyl and trifluoromethyl groups can contribute to the melting point. The ethoxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group is a strong withdrawing group, which introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and one trifluoromethyl group. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
