    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorophene has a melting point that is influenced by its structural components. The basic unit of analysis is the benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of six chlorine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules, estimated at around +100 \u00b0C for each chlorine atom. The chlorine atoms also increase the molecular weight and rigidity, contributing to the melting point. The hexachlorophene structure also includes two fused aromatic rings, which can raise the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring.",
