    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point that we will compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a nitro group, two additional phenyl rings, and a hydroxyl group. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole moment, which can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular interactions. The additional phenyl rings, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The hydroxyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a hydrogen bonding potential.",
