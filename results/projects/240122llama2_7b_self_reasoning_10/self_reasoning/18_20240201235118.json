    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two furanyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C each. Additionally, the dioxime group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The ethanedione base itself has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The furanyl groups can increase the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and create a more rigid structure. Each furanyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The dioxime group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10.",
