    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be butane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a carboxyl group (-COOH) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the presence of a methyl group (-CH3) in the butyl chain can also contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. However, the carboxyl group can also introduce hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a complex interplay between these structural modifications, with the carboxyl group contributing to a higher melting point and the methyl group contributing to a lower melting point.",
