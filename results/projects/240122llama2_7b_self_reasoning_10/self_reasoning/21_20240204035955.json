    "Reason": "1,1'-thiocarbonyldi-2(1H)-pyridone has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The pyridine ring introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The thiocarbonyl group introduces a sulfur atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at +30\u00b0C. The two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
