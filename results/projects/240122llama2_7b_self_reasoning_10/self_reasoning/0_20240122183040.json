    "Reason": "1-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid has a melting point of 120.5\u00b0C according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The methyl group in the side chain of 1-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the carboxylic acid functional group can form hydrogen bonds, which can also contribute to the melting point. The pyrrole ring itself does not contribute significantly to the melting point due to its planarity and lack of functional groups.",
