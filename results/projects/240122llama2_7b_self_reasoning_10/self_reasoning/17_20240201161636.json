    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point is around 30 degrees Celsius. Two phenyl groups add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The benzene ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +20. The methoxy group raises the melting point by about +5 due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
