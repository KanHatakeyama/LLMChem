    "Reason": "1-methylpropyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to a propyl group, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to add approximately +15\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The trifluoromethyl group introduces additional rigidity and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The presence of three fluorine atoms also increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +30\u00b0C for each fluorine.",
