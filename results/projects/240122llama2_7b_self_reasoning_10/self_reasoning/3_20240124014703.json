    "Reason": "5-iodoindole has a melting point that we will predict by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of indole, which has a melting point of -106.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The iodine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and electronegativity, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C. Additionally, the indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and rigidity, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
