    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The methoxy groups (\u2013O\u2013) add approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The iodine atom (I) introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group (C=O) introduces polar interactions, contributing approximately +30\u00b0C. The methoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) adds approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
