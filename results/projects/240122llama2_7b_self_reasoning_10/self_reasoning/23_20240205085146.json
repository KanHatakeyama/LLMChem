    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The hydrogen chloride can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius.",
