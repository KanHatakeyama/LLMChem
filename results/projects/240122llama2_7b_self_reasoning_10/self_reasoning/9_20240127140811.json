    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is imidazole, which has a melting point of -15.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a carbonyl group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
