    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base (melting point around 106\u00b0C) with two methoxy groups, which increase the melting point due to additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. Each methoxy group may contribute around +10\u00b0C. Additionally, the tryptamine base has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups tends to lower the melting point compared to a non-methoxy isoquinoline base, as the methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. However, the exact impact of methoxy substitution is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
