    "Reason": "2,5-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenol groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The dinitro group introduces two nitro functionalities, which significantly increase the melting point due to the strong withdrawing group effect, estimated at approximately +50\u00b0C each. The phenolic hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
