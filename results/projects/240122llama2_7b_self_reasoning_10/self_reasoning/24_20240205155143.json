    "Reason": "2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group also introduces additional molecular weight, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
