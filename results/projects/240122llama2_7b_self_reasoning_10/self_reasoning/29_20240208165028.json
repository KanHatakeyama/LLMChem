    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional pi-system and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
