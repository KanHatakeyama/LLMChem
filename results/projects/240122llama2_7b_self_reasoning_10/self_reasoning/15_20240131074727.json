    "Reason": "3-chloropropionitrile has a melting point that we can compare to propionitrile, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The chlorine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The chlorine and nitro groups work in tandem to increase the melting point.",
