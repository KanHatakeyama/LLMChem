    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxyphenoxy group, a methoxy group, a carbamate group, and a propanediol base. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The propanediol base itself has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius.",
