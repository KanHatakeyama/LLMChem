    "Reason": "1,3-Benzoxazole ring: The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly enhances the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The tert-butyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The carbonyl group raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The thiene ring formation introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly enhances the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
