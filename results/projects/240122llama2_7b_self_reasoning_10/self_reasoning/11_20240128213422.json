    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. The aldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde will affect its melting point: (1) The two phenyl groups can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
