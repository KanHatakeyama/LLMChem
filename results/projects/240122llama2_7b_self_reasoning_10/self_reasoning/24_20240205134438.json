    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base melting point is around 106\u00b0C. The methoxybenzoyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The naphthoyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for three phenyl groups, we have +60\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one ether, +20\u00b0C, and one methoxy group, +5\u00b0C.
