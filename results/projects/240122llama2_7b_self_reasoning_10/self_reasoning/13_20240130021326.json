    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide will affect its melting point: (1) The sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius; (2) The acetamide group (C=O) and the benzene ring it is linked to contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius each; (3) The azide group (N=[N+]=[N-]) introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
