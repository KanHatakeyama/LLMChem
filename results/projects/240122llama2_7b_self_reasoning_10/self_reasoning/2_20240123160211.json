    "Reason": "1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-Octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane has a melting point that we can predict by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,4-diiodobutane, which has a melting point of -10.5 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Each fluorine atom adds approximately +10 due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The iodine atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds, adding around +20. The octafluoro group (\u2013CF2\u2013) adds approximately +20 due to increasing the molecular weight and size, as well as introducing additional hydrogen bonding potential.",
