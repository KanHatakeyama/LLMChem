    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups that can affect its melting point. The basic unit for this compound is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of 120\u00b0C. The presence of three hydroxyl groups can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C each, due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Additionally, the 2-hydroxyethyl substitution can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C, as it creates a more asymmetric structure and reduces the crystal lattice stability. Finally, the carbonyl group can also contribute to the melting point, although its effect is less significant.",
