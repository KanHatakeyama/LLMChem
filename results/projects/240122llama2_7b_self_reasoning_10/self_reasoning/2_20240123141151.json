    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is phenyl, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of a methyl sulfone group can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The bromine atom can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions.",
