    "Reason": "1,4-dione ring with a pyridine base and a methylamino group. The pyridine base itself has a melting point around 106\u00b0C due to the presence of a piperidine ring. The methylamino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
