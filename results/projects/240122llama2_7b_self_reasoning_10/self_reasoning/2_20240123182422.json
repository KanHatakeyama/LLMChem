    "Reason": "2-Methylaziridine has a melting point of around -100\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and rigidity, which generally raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The aziridine ring itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
