    "Reason": "1. Starting with the base unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have a significant structural component to consider. N-phenylmaleimide contains two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. 2. The maleimide group itself can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. 3. The phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity, estimated at around +30 \u00b0C. 4. The ketone group can also participate in dipole interactions, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C. 5. The methylene bridge can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
