    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with two methoxy groups, which might raise the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The xanthene structure also possesses two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring.",
