    "Reason": "4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The allyl group (Cc1ccc(cc1OC)CC=C) introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group (Oc1ccc(cc1OC)CC=C) introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The allyl group introduces additional rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
