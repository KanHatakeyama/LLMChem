    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a significant increase due to the additional molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
