    "Reason": "1,1'-Carbonyl compounds, such as the one in isopropyl n-phenylcarbamate, tend to increase the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which introduces a strong dipole moment and rigidity to the structure. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance the crystalline structure and increase the molecular weight. The isopropyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to increase the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
