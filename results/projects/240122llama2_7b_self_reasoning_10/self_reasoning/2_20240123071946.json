    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point of 116.0\u00b0C. The basic unit is piperazine, which has a melting point of 106.0\u00b0C. The introduction of an ethyl group can lower the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around -5 to -10\u00b0C.",
