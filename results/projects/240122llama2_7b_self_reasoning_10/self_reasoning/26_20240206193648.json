    "Reason": "1,1,2,3-Tetramethylpyrazine has a melting point that we can compare to pyrazine, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be pyrazine. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of four additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a pyrazine ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 1,1,2,3-tetramethylpyrazine, we have four additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
