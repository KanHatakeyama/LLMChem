    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be succinic acid, which has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups (\u2013CH3) in place of hydrogen atoms increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the oxygen within the carboxyl group also increases hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in succinic acid, the additional oxygen atom allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methyl groups into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
