    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group that can increase intermolecular interactions and rigidity. The nitro group can contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C. Additionally, the phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
