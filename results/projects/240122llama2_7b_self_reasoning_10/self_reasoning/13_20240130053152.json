    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group that can increase intermolecular interactions and rigidity. The nitro group can raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the acetonitrile group can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a nitro group and an acetonitrile group. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group that can increase intermolecular interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +50 degrees Celsius. The acetonitrile group can form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
