    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorocyclohexane, such as linuron, has a melting point influenced by its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The chlorine atoms increase the melting point due to their strong electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C for each chlorine. The cyclohexane ring introduces significant rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The nitrogen atom also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C.",
