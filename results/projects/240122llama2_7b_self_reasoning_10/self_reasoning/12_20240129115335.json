    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde will affect its melting point: (1) The dichloro group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius; (2) The benzene ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions and molecular weight, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
