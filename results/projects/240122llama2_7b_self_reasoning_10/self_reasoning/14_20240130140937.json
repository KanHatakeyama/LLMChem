    "Reason": "9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The fluorenyl group itself contributes to the melting point due to its high molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. The succinimide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for the fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy group, let's say it increases it by +30 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methoxy group might raise it by +5 degrees Celsius due to additional hydrogen bonding. The fluorenyl group itself might contribute +30 degrees Celsius due to its high molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The carbonyl group might raise it by +40 degrees Celsius due to the dipole. The succinimide group might raise it by +70 degrees Celsius due to additional rigid structures and hydrogen bonding. The effects are additive.",
