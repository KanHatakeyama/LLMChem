    "Reason": "5-tert-butyl-2-methyl-3-furoic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is furan, which has a melting point of -32.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The tert-butyl group introduces a bulky structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The tert-butyl group also introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
