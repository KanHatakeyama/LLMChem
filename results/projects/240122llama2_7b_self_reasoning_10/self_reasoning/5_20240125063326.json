    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and electronegativity, which raises the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C. The aldehyde group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each phenyl group.",
