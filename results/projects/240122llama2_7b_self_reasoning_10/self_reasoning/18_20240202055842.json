    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume. The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact.",
