    "Reason": "2-phenylhydroquinone has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the phenyl group increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
