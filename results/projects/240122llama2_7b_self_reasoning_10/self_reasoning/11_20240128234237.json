    "Reason": "4-Ethyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol will affect its melting point: (1) The ethyl group (Cc1ccc(cc1OC)) adds approximately +10 due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The methoxy group (Oc1ccc(cc1OC)) adds approximately +5 due to adding more rigid structures and making the molecule more compact. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
