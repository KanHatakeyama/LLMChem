    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base melting point: 30 degrees Celsius. Two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The dicyanogen group (N#C) introduces two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
