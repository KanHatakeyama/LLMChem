    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride has a melting point that we will compare to the base unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. Additionally, the anhydride functional group can raise the melting point due to increased molecular weight and the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C for this structural feature. The cyclohexene moiety can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and rigidity, estimated at around +10 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
