    "Reason": "1,3-dialkylamino compounds, such as benzamide, have a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of a benzene ring introduces rigidity and pi-pi interactions, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +5\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The amide group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of a benzene ring also introduces additional pi-pi interactions, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C.",
