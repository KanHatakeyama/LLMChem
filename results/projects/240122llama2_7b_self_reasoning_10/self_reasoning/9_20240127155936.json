    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane has a melting point of -97.0 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the perfluorinated chain itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and high molecular weight. The exact impact of the perfluorinated chain is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate it as a rough estimate by considering the effect of a similar structure such as hexafluorododecane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius.
