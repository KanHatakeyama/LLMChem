    "Reason": "1,2-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The guanyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The thiourea group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +30\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +10\u00b0C per group, totaling +20\u00b0C.",
