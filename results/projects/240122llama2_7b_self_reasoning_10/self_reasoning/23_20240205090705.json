    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the two ethoxy groups (\u2013O\u2013CH2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20 degrees Celsius per group. The acetate group (\u2013CO\u2013) introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular weight, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius.",
