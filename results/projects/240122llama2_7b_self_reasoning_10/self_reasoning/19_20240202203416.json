    "Reason": "4,4'-Dichlorobenzilate has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The dichloro group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C.",
