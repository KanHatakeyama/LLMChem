    "Reason": "4-bromophenyl methyl sulfone has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom in the molecule increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the sulfone group (-SO2-) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also contribute to the melting point. The bromine atom can also increase the molecular weight and size, which can raise the melting point.",
