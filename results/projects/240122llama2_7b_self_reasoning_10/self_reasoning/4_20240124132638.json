    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene (cis) has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The presence of two chlorine atoms increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity of chlorine, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 2 chlorines) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
