    "Reason": "1H-carbazole has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit is benzene, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the carbazole ring increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. Additionally, the nitrogen atoms within the carbazole ring can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. The exact impact of the carbazole ring is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, considering the increased molecular weight and potential hydrogen bonding, we can estimate a net increase in melting point.",
