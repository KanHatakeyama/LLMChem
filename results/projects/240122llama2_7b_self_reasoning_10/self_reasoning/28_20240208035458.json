    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with two additional phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the two methoxy groups can raise the melting point by about +5 due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The two ether linkages can also contribute +2 for each ether, due to slight increases in molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions. The dioxane-like bridging moiety can add rigidity, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature.",
