    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. Voriconazole has a melting point that is influenced by its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. Voriconazole has two fused aromatic rings, which typically increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring. The molecular structure also includes five methoxy groups; each can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Two ether linkages are present as well, and while they have less impact than methoxy groups, they still increase the melting point through slight contributions to molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 \u00b0C for each ether. Additionally, Voriconazole possesses a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely contribute more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C for this structural feature. The presence of fluorine is also a significant factor, as it increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings.",
