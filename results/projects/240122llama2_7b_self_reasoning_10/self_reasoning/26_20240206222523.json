    "Reason": "9-methylanthracene has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The anthracene ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
