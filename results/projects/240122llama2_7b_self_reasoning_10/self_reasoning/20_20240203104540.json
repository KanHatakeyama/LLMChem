    "Reason": "4-Ethyl-2-methoxyphenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered 2-methoxyphenol (with a melting point of -10\u00b0C) because the ethyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The ethyl group also introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
