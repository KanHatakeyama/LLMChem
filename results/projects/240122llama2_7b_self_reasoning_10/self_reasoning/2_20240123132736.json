    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (base) has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group (\u2013NO2) can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups (\u2013O\u2013CH3) can lower the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The indole ring (\u2013C1=NC=C1\u2013) can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius. Finally, the presence of a carbamate group (\u2013CO\u2013NH\u2013) can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
