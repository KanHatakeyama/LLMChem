    "Reason": "1-Octanamine has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is octanamine, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in N-octyloctan-1-amine will affect its melting point: (1) The octyl group (CCCCCCC) adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The amine group (NCCCCCCC) raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, approximately +10.",
