    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is succinic acid, which has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The carboxyl group introduces a polar carbonyl-like functionalities, which might raise the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion can significantly augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
