    "Reason": "1-pyrrolidinyl substitution tends to increase the melting point compared to phenol, as it creates a more rigid structure with a higher melting point. The additional functionalities in the pyrrolidinyl group can also contribute to the melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be 1-methyl-3-pentanol, which has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The pyrrolidinyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 \u00b0C. The carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
