    "Reason": "2-bromo-2'-methoxyacetophenone has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be acetophenone, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group also introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a methoxy group.",
