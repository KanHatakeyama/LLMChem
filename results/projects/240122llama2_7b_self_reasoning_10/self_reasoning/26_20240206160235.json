    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is pyrrole, which has a melting point of -106.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +10 \u00b0C. The pyrrole ring introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at +20 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 \u00b0C.",
