    "Reason": "2-methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
