    "Reason": "2-Ethylhexane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is hexane, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The presence of two ethyl groups and one methyl group can increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each ethyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius, and the methyl group can raise it by approximately +2 degrees Celsius.",
