    "Reason": "4-Morpholinylmethyl is a functional group that can significantly impact the melting point. Morpholine itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to its rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group also contributes to the melting point, but to a lesser extent. The presence of four morpholinyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional morpholinyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
