    "Reason": "2,5-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is phenol, which has a melting point around 50\u00b0C. The presence of two nitro groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The dinitro group introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would notably augment the melting point. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
