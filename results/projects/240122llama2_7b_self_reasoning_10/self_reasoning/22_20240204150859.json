    "Reason": "3-Chlorophenyl group: The introduction of the 3-chlorophenyl group increases the melting point due to the additional rigidity and pi-system. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
