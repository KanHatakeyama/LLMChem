    "Reason": "1,3-Thiazole ring formation introduces rigid structures that enhance intermolecular interactions and increase the melting point. Each thiazole ring may contribute around +70\u00b0C due to the presence of two carbonyl groups, which can participate in dipole interactions, making the structure more rigid and increasing the melting point. Additionally, the guanyl group introduces aromaticity, which can contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The exact impact of the guanyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. Ring formation: +70\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
