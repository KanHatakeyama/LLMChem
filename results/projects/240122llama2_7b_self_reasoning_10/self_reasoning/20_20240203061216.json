    "Reason": "2,2'-Bis(2-bromo-3-phenylpropyl)-4,4',7,7,7',7'-hexamethyl-2,2'-bi(bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)-3,3'-dione has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 3-phenylpropane, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase due to the higher molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group in the propane moiety adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +30 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a slight increase due to the additional molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ring introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The dione functional group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
