    "Reason": "2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl alcohol has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of three methyl groups (\u2013CH3) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The benzyl group (Cc1cc(c(c1)C)CO) introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl groups also contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5\u00b0C each. The alcohol group (\u2013OH) introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.
