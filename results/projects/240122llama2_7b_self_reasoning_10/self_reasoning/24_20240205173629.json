    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that is influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the sulfonyl group (\u2013SO2\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The acetamide group (\u2013CO\u2013) introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The benzene ring (\u2013Cc1ccc(cc1)\u2013) adds rigidity and molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The sulfur atom (\u2013S\u2013) introduces a rigid structure and potential for hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The nitrogen atom (\u2013N\u2013) introduces a basic unit for hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The azide group (\u2013N=C(=O)\u2013) introduces a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
