    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison can be oleic acid, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. 2. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. 3. The oleic acid moiety itself contributes to the melting point due to its hydrophobic nature and the presence of two carbon-carbon bonds, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. 4. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
