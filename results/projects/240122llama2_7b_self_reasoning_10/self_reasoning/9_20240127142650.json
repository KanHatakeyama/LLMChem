    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for this compound is heptane, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. 2. The introduction of a butyl group (C(CCCCCC)OCCCC) increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. 3. The carboxylate group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. 4. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the symmetry and increasing the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
