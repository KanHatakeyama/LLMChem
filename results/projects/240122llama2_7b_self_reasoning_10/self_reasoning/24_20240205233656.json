    "Reason": "1-Methyl-2-aziridine has a melting point that we can compare to by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for this compound can be 1-methyl-2-aziridine, which has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The aziridine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius.",
