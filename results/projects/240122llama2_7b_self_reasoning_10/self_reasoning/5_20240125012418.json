    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (xanthene) has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, which has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two fused aromatic rings significantly increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. Each additional fused ring can add approximately +25 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the xanthene structure has a melting point-raising effect due to the presence of a dioxane-like bridging moiety, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
