    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is a prop-2-enoate group, which has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C. The methyl groups (~2H_3) add roughly +30\u00b0C to the melting point due to their bulky nature and the increased molecular volume they introduce. The second methyl group (~2H_3) also contributes to the melting point, although to a lesser extent. The (~2H_3) in the carbonyl group also adds roughly +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and the rigidity of the structure.",
