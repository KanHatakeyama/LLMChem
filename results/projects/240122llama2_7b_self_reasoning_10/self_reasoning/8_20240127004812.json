    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point around 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius each.",
