    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a nitro group, a phenyl group, and a fused aromatic ring. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group, when connected to a benzene ring, tends to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The fused aromatic ring also contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring.",
