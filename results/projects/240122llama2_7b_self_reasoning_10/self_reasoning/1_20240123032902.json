    "Reason": "4-cyanophenyl acetate has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit of analysis is the acetate group, which adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The 4-cyanophenyl group adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and aromaticity. The cyano group can increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. The ethyl group can lower the melting point by approximately -5 degrees Celsius due to decreased molecular weight and reduced van der Waals forces.",
