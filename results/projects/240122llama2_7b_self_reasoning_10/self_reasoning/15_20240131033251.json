    "Reason": "1,2-furanyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the dioxime group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
