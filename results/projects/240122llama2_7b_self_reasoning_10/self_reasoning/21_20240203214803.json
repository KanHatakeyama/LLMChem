    "Reason": "1-acetyl-2-phenylhydrazino group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20. The phenyl group in the acetamide moiety adds approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40. The hydrazono-functionalities and phenyl group introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +30. The moramide group includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
