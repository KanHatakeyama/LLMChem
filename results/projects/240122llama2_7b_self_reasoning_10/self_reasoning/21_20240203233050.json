    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point around 116 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is piperazine which has a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. However, 1-ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106 degrees Celsius), two carbonyl groups (+20 degrees Celsius), and one ethyl group (-10 degrees Celsius).",
