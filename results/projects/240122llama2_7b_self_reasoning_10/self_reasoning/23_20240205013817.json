    "Reason": "1. The basic unit for comparison can be heptane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the butyl group (C(CCCCCC)OCCCC) increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The heptane ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20 degrees Celsius.",
