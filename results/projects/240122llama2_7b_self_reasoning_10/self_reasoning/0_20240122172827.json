    "Reason": "Alachlor is a chlorinated compound with multiple functional groups that can affect its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is 1,2-dichloroethane, which has a melting point of -23.5 \u00b0C. The chlorine atoms in alachlor increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and polarizability. The methyl group in alachlor also contributes to the melting point, as it is less polarizable than the chlorine atoms and creates a more rigid structure. Additionally, the nitro functional group in alachlor can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group. The ester linkage in alachlor can also contribute to the melting point, although the effect is less significant than the other functional groups.",
