    "Reason": "1,3-diamino propane has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is propane, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius each. However, the chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The imidic ring formation introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom's effect might be around +10 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
