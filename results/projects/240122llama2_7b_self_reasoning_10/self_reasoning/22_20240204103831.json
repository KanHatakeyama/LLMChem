    "Reason": "1-Decyl-4-methylbenzene has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of a phenyl group generally increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding. The decyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, which raises the melting point. The exact impact of these functional groups can be estimated as follows: The phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group can be estimated to add approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the ability to participate in hydrogen bonding. The decyl group can be estimated to add approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
