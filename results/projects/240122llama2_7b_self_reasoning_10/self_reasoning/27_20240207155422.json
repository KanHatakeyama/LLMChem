    "Reason": "1,3-oxazole ring with a methoxybenzylidene linkage, which introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The phenyl group introduces additional pi-pi interactions and rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The oxazole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
