    "Reason": "2-Methylaziridine has a melting point of -105.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethane, which has a melting point of -172.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The nitrogen atom within the aziridine ring also participates in hydrogen bonding, which can contribute to the melting point. The presence of the nitrogen atom can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
