    "Reason": "3-ethyl-1,1'-biphenyl has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1,1'-biphenyl, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of an ethyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the ethyl group also introduces a new hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should thus be a complex interplay between these two factors. The ethyl group introduces approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity, and -5 due to the additional hydrogen bonding.",
