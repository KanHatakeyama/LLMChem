    "Reason": "5-tert-butyl-2-methyl-3-furoic acid has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methyl group, a furan ring, and a tert-butyl group. The methyl group adds approximately +5\u00b0C due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The furan ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The tert-butyl group adds approximately +5\u00b0C due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume.",
