    "Reason": "2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -11.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of the ethoxy group (\u2013OCH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The ethyl group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, further augmenting the melting point. The acetate group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
