    "Reason": "1,1'-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in hesperetine will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The methoxy group (Oc1ccc(cc1O)C3CC(=O)c2c(cc(O)cc2O)O3) introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
