    "Reason": "The basic unit, ethylamine, has a melting point of -12.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and electronegativity, leading to stronger intermolecular interactions and a higher melting point. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (20 degrees Celsius x 2 chlorines) = 40 degrees Celsius.",
