    "Reason": "9-bromofluorene has a melting point that we can compare to fluorene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.",
