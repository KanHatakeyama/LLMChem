    "Reason": "4-Nhac-2266-tetrame-piperidin-n-oxide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is piperidine, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The presence of four methoxy groups increases the melting point due to additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The oxime group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and molecular volume, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The carbamate group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The presence of four methoxy groups increases the melting point due to additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential.",
