    "Reason": "4-Nhac-2266-tetrame-piperidin-n-oxide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point. Starting with the base of piperidine, which has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C. The presence of four methoxy groups can increase the melting point due to additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each. The oxime group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The ketone group can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The presence of four fused aromatic rings can significantly increase the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +80\u00b0C for each additional fused ring.",
