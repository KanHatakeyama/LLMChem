    "Reason": "2-amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine has a basic unit of pyridine, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The presence of a fluorine atom can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to the increased steric hindrance and electronegativity. The chlorine atom can also contribute to the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to its electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. However, the 2-amino group can lower the melting point by approximately -5\u00b0C due to its electron-donating ability and the resulting decrease in steric hindrance. Summing up these changes: Pyridine base (+100\u00b0C), fluorine atom (+10\u00b0C), and 2-amino group (-5\u00b0C).",
