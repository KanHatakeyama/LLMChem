    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure and creates a more asymmetric structure, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The acetamide group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The azide group introduces a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group also introduces a more rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C each, due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of two additional phenyl groups.",
