    "Reason": "1,3-propanedithiol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.15\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
