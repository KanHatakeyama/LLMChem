    "Reason": "17-Ol has a melting point that is influenced by its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is oleic acid, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functionalities and structural features in 17-Ol will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The piperidine ring (N1CCCC1) and 1-ethyl-4-methylenepiperidine moiety may both add roughly +20 each due to adding more rigid ring structures and making the molecule more compact; (4) The androstane ring (C4CCCCC4) includes functionalities related to steroids, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
