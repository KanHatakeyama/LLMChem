    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide has a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of a benzene ring introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The thiosemicarbazide moiety introduces a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of these functional groups can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds.",
