    "Reason": "2-ethylhexylacetate has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be hexadecane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The introduction of the 2-ethyl group and the methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The ethyl group introduces a new hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The methyl group introduces a new hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The effects are additive.",
