    "Reason": "1,3-dichloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.2 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional carbon atoms and a methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a slight increase in molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions, estimated at +2 degrees Celsius.",
