    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol, the base compound, has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. The cyano group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The phenol group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
