    "Reason": "1-Proline, 1-acetyl-4-hydroxy-, trans- has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is glycine, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. (2) The acetyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. (3) The hydroxyl group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. (4) The ketone group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
