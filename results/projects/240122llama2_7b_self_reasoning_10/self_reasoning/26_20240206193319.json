    "Reason": "4-Morpholinylmethyl is a functional group that can significantly impact the melting point. Morpholinyl is a rigid structure with a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5 \u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a strong hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +30 \u00b0C. The presence of four morpholinyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional morpholinyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
