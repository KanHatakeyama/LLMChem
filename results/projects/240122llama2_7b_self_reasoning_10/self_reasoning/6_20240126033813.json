    "Reason": "1,1-Decan is a basic unit for our comparison, with a melting point of -17.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of five additional carbon atoms and the resulting increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions will significantly raise the melting point. Each additional carbon atom can be estimated to add approximately 20 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.",
