    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The introduction of an isopropyl group (\u2013CH(CH3)\u2013) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The acetate group (\u2013CO\u2013O\u2013) adds a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The exact impact of these structural modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate the net effect by considering the increase in molecular weight and size and the potential for hydrogen bonding.",
