    "Reason": "1,3-Benzodioxole base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, due to the presence of two carbonyl groups and the rigid structure they form. The methylene bridge (O=C1C(SC2=NCCCN12)=Cc4ccc3OCOc3c4) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The thiazole ring introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The pyrimidine ring (3(2H)-one) adds more rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +30\u00b0C. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
