    "Reason": "5-bromo-2-nitropyridine has a basic unit of pyridine, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The bromine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The nitro group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
