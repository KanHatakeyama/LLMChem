    "Reason": "1,2,3,4,5-pentachloropyridine has a melting point that is influenced by several structural components. The basic unit for comparison is pyridine, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The introduction of five chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. Each chlorine is estimated to add approximately +10\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the pyridine ring formation introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C.",
