    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a melting point that we will analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The presence of three hydroxyl groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +30 degrees Celsius for each hydroxyl group. The ethyl group introduces a rigid structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, estimated at around -10 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole, raising the melting point by approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The presence of three hydroxyl groups and one carbonyl group significantly impacts the melting point.",
