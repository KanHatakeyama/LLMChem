    "Reason": "3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl ester group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces a polar functional group, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, estimated at +20\u00b0C each, due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
