    "Reason": "2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)phenol has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The pyrrolidine ring itself has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius due to its rigidity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. The phenol group has a melting point of around -5 degrees Celsius due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. The presence of two phenol groups can increase the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and the increased molecular weight. The pyrrolidine ring can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. The total increase in melting point due to the pyrrolidine ring and phenol groups can be estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
