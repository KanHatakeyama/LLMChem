    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a phenyl group, which increases the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and form a rigid structure. The methyl group also increases the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding. The exact impact of the methyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can assume a small increase of around +10\u00b0C due to the additional hydrogen bonding potential.",
