    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The presence of a phenylmethyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013) can increase the melting point due to the additional rigidity and molecular weight. The phenyl group itself can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
