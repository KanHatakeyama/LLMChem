    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 4,6-dinitrophenol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of two additional phenyl groups linked in a linear fashion significantly increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the amino group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The nitro groups also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase molecular weight, estimated at around +20\u00b0C each.",
