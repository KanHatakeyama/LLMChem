    "Reason": "1-acetyl-2-phenylhydrazino group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The phenyl group in the acetamide moiety adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The hydrazono-functionalities and phenyl group introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, this prediction is adjusted by the fact that the base unit has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. Thus, the net effect is +70\u00b0C.",
