    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (Toremifene) has a melting point of 100.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, which has a melting point of 100.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methoxy group can contribute around +10 to +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the presence of a nitro group can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can contribute around +10 to +20\u00b0C. Finally, the carbamate group can also increase the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can contribute around +10 to +20\u00b0C.",
