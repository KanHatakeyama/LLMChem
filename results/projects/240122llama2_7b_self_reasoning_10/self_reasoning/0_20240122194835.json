    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of a 2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl group will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and enhance the crystalline structure. The methyl group can also contribute to the rigidity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point.",
