    "Reason": "2-Amino-pyridine base, with a melting point of around 106\u00b0C. The pyridine ring itself contributes to a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methylamino group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The carbonyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
