    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. Naproanilide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for this compound can be considered piperazine, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the naphthalene ring introduces a rigid structure and additional pi-pi interactions, which can contribute to the melting point. The ethyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to the melting point.
