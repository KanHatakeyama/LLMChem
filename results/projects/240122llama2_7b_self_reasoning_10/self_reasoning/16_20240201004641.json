    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalen-2-yl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The acetonitrile group introduces a polar functional group, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
