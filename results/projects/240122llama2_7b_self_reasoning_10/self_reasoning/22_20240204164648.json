    "Reason": "2,5-dinitrophenol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to a base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is the phenol group, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two nitro groups increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each nitro group may contribute around +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the dinitro group introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would notably augment the melting point. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
