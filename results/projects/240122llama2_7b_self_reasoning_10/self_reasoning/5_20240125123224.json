    "Reason": "1,2-diphenylethanone has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, ethanone, has a melting point of -114.15 degrees Celsius. The presence of two phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the ketone group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20 to +40 degrees Celsius.",
