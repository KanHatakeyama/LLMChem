    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, due to the presence of two carbonyl groups, which can participate in dipole interactions and rigidify the structure, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C for each carbonyl. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The propan-1-imine base introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
