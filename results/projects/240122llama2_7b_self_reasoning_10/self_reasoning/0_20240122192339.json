    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene is a saturated hydrocarbon with a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the cis-configuration of the double bonds also affects the molecular structure and hydrogen bonding potential, which can either increase or decrease the melting point depending on the specific arrangement of the double bonds. In this case, the cis-configuration creates a more rigid and planar molecular structure, which may increase the melting point.",
