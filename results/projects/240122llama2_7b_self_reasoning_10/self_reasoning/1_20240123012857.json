    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit of analysis is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The presence of an acetamide group increases the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and the increase in molecular weight. The sulfonyl group also contributes to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a polar functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The azide group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The presence of these functional groups can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C, +20\u00b0C, and +30\u00b0C, respectively.",
