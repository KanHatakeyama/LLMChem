    "Reason": "2,5-dinitrophenol has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of phenol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius, we have substantial structural components to consider. The introduction of two nitro groups (\u2013NO2) increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius for each nitro group. Additionally, the dinitro group introduces two additional oxygen atoms, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The molecular structure also includes a methoxy group (\u2013OCH3), which can contribute to the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
