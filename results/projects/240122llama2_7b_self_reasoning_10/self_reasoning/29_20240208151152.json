    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
