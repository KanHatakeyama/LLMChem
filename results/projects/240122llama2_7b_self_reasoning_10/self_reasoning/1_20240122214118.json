    "Reason": "4-Cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the structural modifications from the base unit, benzene. The cyclohexene group, which is a saturated, rigid structure, can increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C due to the enhancement of molecular rigidity. The carboxylic acid and anhydride functionalities can also contribute to the melting point, with the carboxylic acid group estimated to add +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, and the anhydride group estimated to add +30\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The presence of two carboxylic acid groups can also contribute to the melting point, with each group estimated to add +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential.",
