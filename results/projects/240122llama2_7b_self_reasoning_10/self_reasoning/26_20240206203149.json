    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the nitro functional group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
