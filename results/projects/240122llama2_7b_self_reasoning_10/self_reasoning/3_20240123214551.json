    "Reason": "1-Octanol, which has a melting point of -12.5 degrees Celsius, can be used as a base for comparison. The methyl group in methyl oleate increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The oleic acid moiety introduces a carboxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, lowering the melting point. The methyl group also introduces a methyl group, which can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity. The carboxyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay between the methyl group and the oleic acid moiety.",
