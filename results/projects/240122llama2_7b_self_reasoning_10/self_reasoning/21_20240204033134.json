    "Reason": "2,3-dibromosuccinic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is succinic acid, which has a melting point of around 120\u00b0C. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at approximately +20\u00b0C for each bromine. The carboxyl group introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +60\u00b0C.",
