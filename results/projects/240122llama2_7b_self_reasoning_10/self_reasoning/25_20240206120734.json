    "Reason": "1,3-Bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point. The basic unit we can compare to is 3-methylbutane, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane will affect its melting point: (1) Two phenyl groups, which could each add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The tertiary butyl group (C(C)C) is a bulky group which could add about +10 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (3) The moramide group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) includes functionalities related to amides, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +30. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
