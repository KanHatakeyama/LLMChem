    "Reason": "1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-Octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is 1,4-diiodobutane, which has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity raising the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius for each fluorine. Additionally, the iodine atom introduces a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms also increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
