    "Reason": "1,1'-Incasan has a melting point that is influenced by its structural components. Starting with the base unit of benzene (melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C), we have substantial structural components to consider. The molecular structure includes a phenyl group, which typically raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-stacking interactions. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20 \u00b0C for each additional phenyl group due to increased molecular weight and pi-stacking interactions. Additionally, Incasan contains a methoxy group, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The molecular structure also includes a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group that increases intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C. Lastly, Incasan has a fused aromatic ring system, which can contribute to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C for each additional fused aromatic ring.",
