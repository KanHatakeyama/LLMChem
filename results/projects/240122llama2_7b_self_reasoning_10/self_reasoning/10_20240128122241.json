    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of two chloromethyl groups (\u2013CH2Cl) increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the chlorine atom within each methyl group also increases the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 2 chloromethyl groups) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
