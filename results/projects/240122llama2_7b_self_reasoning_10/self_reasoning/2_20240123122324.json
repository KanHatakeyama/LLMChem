    "Reason": "1E-N-hydroxy-1-(4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl)propan-1-imine has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, which will impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is 1-propanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group (-OH) increases the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group (-CH3) adds approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The bicyclic system (4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl) adds approximately +30 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. The imine group (N=C=O) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group (C1CC2) adds approximately +2 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
