    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of two phenyl groups, which can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Additionally, the benzamide-like bridging can add rigidity, estimated at around +10 due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
