    "Reason": "3-Amino-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazole has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 1-phenylhydrazine, which has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a 4-chlorophenyl group increases the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the amino group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
