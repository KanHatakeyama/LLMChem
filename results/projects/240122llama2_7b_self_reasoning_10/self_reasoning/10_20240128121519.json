    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-imidazolidine has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound is the imidazolidine ring, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of four carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the tetrahydroxysuccinic acid structure has additional functional groups that can affect its melting point: (1) The two methyl groups can each add approximately +5 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The imidazolidine ring itself can contribute around +20 due to the presence of a rigid ring structure; (3) The carbonyl group can add approximately +10 due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Summing up these changes: Imidazolidine base (+106\u00b0C), four carbonyl groups (+40\u00b0C), and two methyl groups (+10\u00b0C).",
