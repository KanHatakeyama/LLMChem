    "Reason": "4-chlorophenyl group: The 4-chlorophenyl group introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +80\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The piperidine ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
