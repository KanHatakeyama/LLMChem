    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The bromine atoms increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius for each bromine atom. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The dioxane-like bridging moiety adds rigidity and likely contributes more significantly than a simple ether, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius for this structural feature.",
