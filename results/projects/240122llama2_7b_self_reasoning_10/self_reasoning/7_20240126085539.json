    "Reason": "2-chloroethylamine has a melting point of around -100 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and electronegativity, which raises the melting point. Each chlorine is estimated to add approximately +50 due to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions.",
