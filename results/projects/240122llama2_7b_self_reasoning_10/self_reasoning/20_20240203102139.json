    "Reason": "1,4-Benzendiol base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The phenylmethyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, approximately -5\u00b0C.",
