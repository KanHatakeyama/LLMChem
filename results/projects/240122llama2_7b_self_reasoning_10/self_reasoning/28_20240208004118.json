    "Reason": "2-Amino-4,6-dinitrophenol has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is 4-nitrophenol, which has a melting point of -10.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl groups and a nitro group increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of pi-pi interactions. Each phenyl group may add approximately +30 to +50\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The amino group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
