    "Reason": "1-chloropropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be propane, which has a melting point of -18.0 degrees Celsius (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a chlorine atom, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the propane chain.",
