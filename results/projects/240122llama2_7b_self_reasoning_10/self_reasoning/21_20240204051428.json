    "Reason": "16-methyl-17-oxoandrost-5-en-3-yl acetate has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is androstane, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The oxo group (\u2013O\u2013) introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The acetate group (\u2013CO\u2013) introduces a carbonyl-like functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The ketone group (\u2013CO\u2013) introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The oxo group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +5\u00b0C.
