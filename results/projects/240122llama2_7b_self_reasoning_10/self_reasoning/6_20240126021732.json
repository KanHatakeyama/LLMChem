    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzenes have a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The presence of four phenyl groups in tricresyl phosphate increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (20 degrees Celsius x 4 phenyls) = 80 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the phosphate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may further contribute to the melting point.",
