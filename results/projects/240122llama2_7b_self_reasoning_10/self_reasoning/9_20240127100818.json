    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is piperazine, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
