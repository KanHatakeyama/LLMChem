    "Reason": "3'-Nitrobenzanilide has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The aniline ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups also contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C.",
