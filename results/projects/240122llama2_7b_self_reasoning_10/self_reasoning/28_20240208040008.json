    "Reason": "1,1-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group raises the melting point due to additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage reduces the melting point due to reduced hydrogen bonding, estimated at -2 degrees Celsius.",
