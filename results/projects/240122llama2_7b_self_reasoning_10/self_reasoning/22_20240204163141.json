    "Reason": "1,3-propanedisil is a basic unit for comparison. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The ethyl group introduces a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
