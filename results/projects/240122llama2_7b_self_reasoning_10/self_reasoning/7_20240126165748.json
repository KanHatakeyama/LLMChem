    "Reason": "1,2-Bis(chloromethyl)benzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of two chloromethyl groups (\u2013ClCc1ccccc1C\u2013) increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom also introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C.",
