    "Reason": "1. Fluorine substituents significantly increase the melting point due to strong electronegativity which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine is estimated to add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
