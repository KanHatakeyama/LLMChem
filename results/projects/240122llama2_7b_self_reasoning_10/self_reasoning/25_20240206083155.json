    "Reason": "2-Vinylbenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a vinyl group and a carboxylic acid functional group. The vinyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in dipole interactions and raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group can also contribute to the melting point, albeit at a lower extent than the vinyl group, due to the reduced ability of the methoxy group to participate in dipole interactions.",
