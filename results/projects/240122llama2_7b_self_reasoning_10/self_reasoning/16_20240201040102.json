    "Reason": "1-(2-nitro),2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine has a complex structure with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a significant increase due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. The tert-butyl group introduces a rigid structure, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The dibenzoyl group introduces two additional phenyl rings, which would significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. The hydrazine group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. The nitro group introduces a significant increase due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight.",
