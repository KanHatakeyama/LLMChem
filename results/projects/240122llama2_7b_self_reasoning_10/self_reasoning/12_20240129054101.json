    "Reason": "3-sulfolene has a melting point that is influenced by its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, we need to consider the functional groups: (1) Two phenyl groups, which would add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
