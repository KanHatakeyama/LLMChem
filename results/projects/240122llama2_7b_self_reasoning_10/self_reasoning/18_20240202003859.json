    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The basic unit of analysis is the 1,2-propanediol moiety, which on its own exhibits intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thus increasing the melting point. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity and van der Waals forces, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The thienyl group introduces additional pi-stacking interactions, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
