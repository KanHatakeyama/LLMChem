    "Reason": "5-butyl-5-ethylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that impact its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is barbituric acid, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the ethyl group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The butyl group also introduces a rigid structure, which can contribute approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole moment, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
