    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can reduce the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to steric hindrance. The oxygen within the methoxy group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
