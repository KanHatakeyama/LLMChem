    "Reason": "5-(4-morpholinyl)-2-nitrophenol has a melting point influenced by its structural components relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is 2-nitrophenol, which has a melting point of around 106\u00b0C due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong withdrawing group increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The morpholinyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly augment the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +25 \u00b0C for each additional fused ring.",
