    "Reason": "1,3-di-p-tolyl-2-thiourea has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a thiourea group. The phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The thiourea group introduces a strong dipole, which raises the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential.",
