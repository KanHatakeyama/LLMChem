    "Reason": "1-Pyrrolidinyl group introduces a rigid structure with increased molecular weight, which raises the melting point. The pyrrolidinyl group itself does not participate in hydrogen bonding, but it introduces a rigid structure that can participate in dipole interactions, which raises the melting point. The methoxy group also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius.",
