    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The chlorine atoms also increase the electronegativity, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular polarity. The net effect is a significant increase in the melting point.",
