    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-cyanopyridine has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for our comparison will be pyridine, which has a melting point of -15.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a bromine atom and a cyano group. The bromine atom introduces a significant increase in molecular weight and electronegativity, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
