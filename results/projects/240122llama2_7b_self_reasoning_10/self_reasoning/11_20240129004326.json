    "Reason": "2-Nitrophenyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a nitro group, which introduces a strong dipole moment and increased molecular weight. The nitro group can raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. The estimated increase for the nitro group is around +50 degrees Celsius, and the phenyl group can add approximately +30 degrees Celsius due to increased pi-pi interactions and molecular rigidity.",
