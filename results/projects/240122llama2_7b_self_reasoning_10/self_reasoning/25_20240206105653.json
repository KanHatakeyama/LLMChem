    "Reason": "3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The carboxy group introduces polar interactions, contributing approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +40\u00b0C per group, totaling +80\u00b0C.",
