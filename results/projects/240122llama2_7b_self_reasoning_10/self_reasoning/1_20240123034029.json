    "Reason": "1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole has a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a phenyl group, which increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The chlorine atom raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. The tetrazole ring itself does not significantly affect the melting point, but it can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may slightly lower the melting point.",
