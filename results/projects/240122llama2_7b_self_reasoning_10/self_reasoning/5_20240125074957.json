    "Reason": "3-heptene has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is ethene, which has a melting point of -169 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 3-heptene will affect its melting point: (1) The heptene chain introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can contribute to a higher melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. (2) The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +10 degrees Celsius. (3) The trans-configuration can introduce some steric hindrance and rigidity, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
