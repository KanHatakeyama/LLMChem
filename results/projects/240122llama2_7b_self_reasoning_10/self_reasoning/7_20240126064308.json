    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. Starting with the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider: (1) Two phenyl groups, which add approximately +20\u00b0C due to increasing molecular weight and van der Waals interactions; (2) The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, raising the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C; (3) The indole ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C; and (4) The methyl group can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to reducing the molecular weight and steric hindrance.",
