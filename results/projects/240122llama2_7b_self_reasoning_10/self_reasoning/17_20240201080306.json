    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The methoxy groups and iodine atom each contribute to the melting point: (1) The two methoxy groups increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each methoxy group might raise the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius. (2) The iodine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius.",
