    "Reason": "17-Ol has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is a steroid, which has a melting point around 100\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +10\u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups (one from the ketone and one from the methoxy group) can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl.",
