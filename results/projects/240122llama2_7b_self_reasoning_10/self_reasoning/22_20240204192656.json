    "Reason": "1,1-Dimethylacetamide has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, acetamide, has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each methyl group may contribute around +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
