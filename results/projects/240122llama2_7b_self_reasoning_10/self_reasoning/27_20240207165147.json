    "Reason": "4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is ethylbenzene, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional phenyl groups increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Each phenyl group can raise the melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the methyl groups introduce additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius each.",
