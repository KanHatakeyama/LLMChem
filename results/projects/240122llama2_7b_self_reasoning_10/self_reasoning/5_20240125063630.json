    "Reason": "2,4-dibromobenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of two bromine atoms increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +20 \u00b0C. The bromine atoms also enhance the pi-pi interactions, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The presence of two methyl groups can also contribute to the melting point, as they increase the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, estimated at around +5 \u00b0C each.",
