    "Reason": "1,3,5-Trimethyl-2-nitrobenzene has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The introduction of a nitro group (\u2013NO2) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The methyl groups (\u2013CH3) add approximately +5 \u00b0C due to slight increases in molecular weight and possible weak dipole interactions. The trimethyl group (\u2013C(C)C) adds approximately +10 \u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
