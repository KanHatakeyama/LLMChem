    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenyl can increase the melting point due to the additional rigidity and pi-system. Each cyano group can contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C. The acetate group can also contribute to the melting point due to the additional carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
