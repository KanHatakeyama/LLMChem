    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione base, with a melting point around 106\u00b0C, due to the presence of two carbonyl groups and the rigidity they bring. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can contribute to the melting point, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl groups can significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
