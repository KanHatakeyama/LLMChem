    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its functional groups. The basic unit of analysis is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The presence of three hydroxyethyl groups increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Each hydroxyethyl group raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the cyanuric acid moiety itself has a melting point of 100\u00b0C.",
