    "Reason": "4-Morpholinylmethyl is a functional group that can significantly increase the melting point due to the presence of a morpholine ring, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the molecular weight. The morpholine ring itself has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The hydroxyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
