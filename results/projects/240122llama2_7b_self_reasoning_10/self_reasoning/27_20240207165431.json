    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The presence of two methoxy groups can raise the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity they introduce; we can estimate this at around +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the naphthalene ring formation introduces two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
