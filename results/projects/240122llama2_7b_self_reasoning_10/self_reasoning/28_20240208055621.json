    "Reason": "2-bromo-2'-methoxyacetophenone has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is acetophenone, which has a melting point of 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius.",
