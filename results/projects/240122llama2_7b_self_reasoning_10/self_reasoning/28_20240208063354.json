    "Reason": "1,1'-Dimethylacetamide has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered acetamide (with a melting point of -10.0\u00b0C) because the methyl groups significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each methyl group may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
