    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol base, with a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atom raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the rigidity it brings. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius.
