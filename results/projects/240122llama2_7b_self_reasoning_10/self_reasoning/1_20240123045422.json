    "Reason": "3-Nitrostilbene has a melting point that can be predicted by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is stilbene, which has a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C. The nitro functional group (NO2) generally increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group can also introduce some rigidity to the structure, which can contribute to the melting point.",
