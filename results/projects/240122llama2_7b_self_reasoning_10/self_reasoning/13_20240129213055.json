    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is indole, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. Additionally, the indole ring itself can contribute to the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each indole ring may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
