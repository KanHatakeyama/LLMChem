    "Reason": "1,3,4-Thiadiazole ring: The 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced molecular weight and the absence of a hydrogen bonding potential. The Incasan base itself has a melting point around 100\u00b0C.",
