    "Reason": "2-bromo-4-cyanopyridine has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The pyridine ring introduces rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
