    "Reason": "1,1-Terphenyl base has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion significantly augment the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 degrees Celsius to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the norgestimate structure contains a dioxane-like bridging moiety, which would add rigidity and likely increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius.",
