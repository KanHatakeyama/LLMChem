    "Reason": "9-methylanthracene has a melting point that we can compare to anthracene, which has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a rigid structure and raises the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The methyl group also introduces a new hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The net effect is a complex interplay between the increased molecular weight and rigidity and the additional hydrogen bonding.",
