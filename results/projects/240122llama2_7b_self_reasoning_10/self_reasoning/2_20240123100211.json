    "Reason": "1,3-propanedithiol has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom in the thiol group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. Each sulfur can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius due to hydrogen bonding.",
