    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylenepyridine has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, ethylene, has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methylene bridge introduces additional rigidity, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring introduces additional rigidity, estimated at approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, estimated at approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at approximately +5 degrees Celsius.",
