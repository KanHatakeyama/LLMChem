    "Reason": "2-Methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The aldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methoxy group also introduces additional rigidity, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
