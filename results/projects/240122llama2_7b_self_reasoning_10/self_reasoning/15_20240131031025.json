    "Reason": "1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be ethylene (with a melting point of -169.2\u00b0C) because the methyl group introduces a rigid structure and the methylene bridge reduces the symmetry, which might notably augment the melting point. The methyl group also introduces a hydroxyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C. The methylene bridge reduces the symmetry and introduces additional rigid structures, which might raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
