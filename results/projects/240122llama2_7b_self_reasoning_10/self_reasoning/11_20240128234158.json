    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The nitro functional group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The toluene ring introduces additional rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The nitro group also introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
