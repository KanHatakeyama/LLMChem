    "Reason": "5-bromoindole has a melting point influenced by its functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The methyl group reduces the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions.
