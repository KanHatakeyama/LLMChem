    "Reason": "9-Nitroanthracene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for this compound can be considered anthracene, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a strong dipole moment, increasing intermolecular interactions and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the nitro group can participate in hydrogen bonding, further contributing to the melting point. The exact impact of the nitro group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, we can estimate its effect as a rough estimate.",
