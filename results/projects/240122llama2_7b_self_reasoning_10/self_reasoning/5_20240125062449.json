    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can predict by analyzing its structural components. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group (\u2013SO2\u2013) introduces a rigid structure and increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The acetamide group (\u2013CO\u2013NH\u2013) introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The azide group (\u2013N=N\u2013) introduces a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group (\u2013SO2\u2013NH\u2013) introduces a polar carbonyl interaction, which raises the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) introduces a rigid structure and reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The effects are additive.",
