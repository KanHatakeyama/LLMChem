    "Reason": "2,3,4-trinitro-toluene has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The nitro functional group (\u2013NO2) raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The toluene ring (C) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group (\u2013CH3) reduces the melting point due to the reduced molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around -5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group (\u2013NO2) increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius. The presence of three nitro groups significantly increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and dipole-dipole interactions. Each nitro group may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C.",
