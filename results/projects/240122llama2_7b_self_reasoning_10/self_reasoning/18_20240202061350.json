    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has a melting point of 205 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of N,N-Bis{2-[bis(carboxymethyl)amino]ethyl}glycine, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. Additionally, the carboxymethyl group introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C. The amino group also introduces additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The glycine base itself also contributes to the melting point due to its rigid structure and hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at around +20\u00b0C.",
