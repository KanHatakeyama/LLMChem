    "Reason": "d-galacturonic acid has a melting point of around 50 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is galactose, which has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in d-galacturonic acid will affect its melting point: (1) The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces; (2) The methyl group (-CH3) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular volume and reduced hydrogen bonding; (3) The hydroxyl group (-OH) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and hydrogen bonding; (4) The ketone group (-CO-C=O) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
