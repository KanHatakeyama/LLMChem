    "Reason": "4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide has a melting point that we can analyze by considering its structural components. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The sulfonyl group introduces a rigid structure with a melting point increase of approximately +20 \u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The acetamide group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The azide group introduces a nitrogen atom with a high electronegativity, which can participate in dipole interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The sulfonyl group also introduces a rigid structure with a melting point increase of approximately +20 \u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding.",
