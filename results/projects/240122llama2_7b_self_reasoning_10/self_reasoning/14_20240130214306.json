    "Reason": "1-oxoindane has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a methoxy group and a carboxylic acid functional group. The methoxy group can raise the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The carboxylic acid group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the oxoindane ring formation can also contribute to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
