    "Reason": "1-acetyl-2-phenylhydrazino group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The phenyl group in the acetamide moiety also contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +20 \u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40 \u00b0C. The hydrazono-functionalities and phenyl group introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70 \u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for three phenyl groups, we have +60 \u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +50 \u00b0C, the carbonyl function at +30 \u00b0C (lesser than a typical ketone due to conjugation and steric hindrance by the adjacent large groups), and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +40 \u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system). This totals to an adjusted predicted increase of +180 \u00b0C.",
