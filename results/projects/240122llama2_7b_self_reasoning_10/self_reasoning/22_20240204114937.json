    "Reason": "1-Aspartic acid base, with a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius, due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The benzyl group introduces a rigid structure with potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The aspartic acid moiety introduces additional hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group introduces additional rigidity, estimated at +10 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group introduces additional hydrogen bonding, estimated at +5 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
