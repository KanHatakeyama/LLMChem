    "Reason": "1-propanone, also known as acetone, has a melting point of -12.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a 2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the hydroxyl group also increases hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. The methyl group also adds rigidity to the structure, which can increase the melting point. The net effect should be a decreased melting point due to the hydroxyl group and increased molecular weight but a more significant increase due to the methyl group.",
