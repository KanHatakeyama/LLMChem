    "Reason": "1-methylcyclohexane has a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius. The basic unit we can compare to is cyclohexane, which has a melting point of -169 degrees Celsius. The additional functional group in 1-methylcyclohexane is a methyl group, which adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increasing the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
