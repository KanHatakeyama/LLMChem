    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison can be piperazine, which has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The introduction of the methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume. The methyl group introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point. The exact impact of the methyl group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. Ring formation: +35\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
