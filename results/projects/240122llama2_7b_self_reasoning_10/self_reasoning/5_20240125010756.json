    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the structural modifications relative to benzene. The basic unit for comparison is ethylbenzene, which has a melting point of -109.4\u00b0C. The introduction of two additional methyl groups and one ethyl group increases the molecular weight and rigidity of the structure, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C each. Additionally, the 5-methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which can add approximately +10\u00b0C due to steric hindrance and molecular volume. The methyl groups also contribute to hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
