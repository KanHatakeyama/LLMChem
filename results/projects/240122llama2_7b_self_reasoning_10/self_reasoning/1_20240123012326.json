    "Reason": "2-ethylhexylacetate has a melting point of -100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two additional carbon atoms and a methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the ethyl group also introduces a hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding. The net effect should be a raised melting point due to the larger size and molecular weight but a lowered melting point due to the additional hydrogen bonding potential.",
