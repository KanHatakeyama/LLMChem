    "Reason": "2-pyridineacetamide has a basic unit of pyridine, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The pyridine ring introduces a rigid structure and additional hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The acetamide group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions, estimated at around +10\u00b0C.",
