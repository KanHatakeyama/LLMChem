    "Reason": "5-tert-butyl-2-methyl-3-furoic acid has a melting point of 100.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is 3-furoic acid, which has a melting point of -11.0 degrees Celsius. The tert-butyl group increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity. The methyl group also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The furan ring also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. The net effect of these functional groups is an increase in the melting point.",
