    "Reason": "1,2,3-Trinitro compounds have a melting point influenced by the functional groups relative to benzene's melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of three nitro groups significantly increases the melting point due to the ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each nitro group may contribute around +50 to +70\u00b0C.",
