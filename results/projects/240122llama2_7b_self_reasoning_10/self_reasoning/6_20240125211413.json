    "Reason": "2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components: (1) The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. (2) The two chlorine atoms increase the molecular weight and electronegativity, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C each. (3) The aldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20 to +30\u00b0C. (4) The two phenyl groups can add approximately +30 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
