    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine base, which has a melting point around 106 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a piperazine ring and a methyl group. The piperazine ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl group introduces a small increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at around +5 degrees Celsius.",
