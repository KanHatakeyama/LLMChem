    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde will affect its melting point: (1) Two methoxy groups, which can increase the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding; (2) The iodine atom can participate in hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +2 degrees Celsius.",
