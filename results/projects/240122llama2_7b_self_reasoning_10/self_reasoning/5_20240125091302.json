    "Reason": "1,1'-Methacryloyl chloride has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is acetone, which has a melting point of -11.0\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The methacryloyl group introduces a rigid structure with a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also contributes to the melting point due to its electronegativity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +5\u00b0C.
