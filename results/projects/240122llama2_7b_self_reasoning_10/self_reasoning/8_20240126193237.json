    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for this compound can be considered 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, which has a melting point of 106.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of four methoxy groups can raise the melting point due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. Each methoxy group may contribute around +5 to +10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the tetrahydroisoquinoline base has a melting point of 106 degrees Celsius.",
