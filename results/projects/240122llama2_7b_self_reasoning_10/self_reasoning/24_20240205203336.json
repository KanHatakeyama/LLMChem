    "Reason": "3-Nitrophenyl group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -10\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a significant withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The phenyl group introduces additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The sulfur atom introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at around +10\u00b0C. The methyl group reduces the melting point due to the reduced symmetry and increased molecular volume, estimated at around -10\u00b0C.",
