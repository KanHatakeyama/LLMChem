    "Reason": "4-cyano-4'-n-heptyloxybiphenyl has a melting point that we can predict by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is biphenyl, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of the heptyloxy group (\u2013OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2) adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and the presence of hydroxyl groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The cyano group (\u2013CN) raises the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and the presence of a dipole moment, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The heptyloxy group (\u2013OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2) adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and the presence of hydroxyl groups, which can participate in hydrogen bonding.",
