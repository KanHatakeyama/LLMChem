    "Reason": "5-chloro-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is phenol, which has a melting point of 5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole moment, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The nitro group also introduces a dipole moment, which raises the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also participates in hydrogen bonding, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The total effect of these functional groups can be estimated by adding their individual contributions.",
