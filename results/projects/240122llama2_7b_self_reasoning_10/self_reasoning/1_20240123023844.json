    "Reason": "Naproanilide is a compound with a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit of analysis is naphthalene, which has a melting point of 95 degrees Celsius. Naproanilide has two phenyl groups, which will increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group can contribute around +30 to +50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the presence of an amide group can also increase the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and the increase in molecular weight. The amide group can contribute around +20 to +30 degrees Celsius. Finally, the presence of a methoxy group can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The methoxy group can contribute around +5 to +10 degrees Celsius.",
