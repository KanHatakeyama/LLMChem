    "Reason": "2-Methoxybenzaldehyde has a melting point that we can compare to benzene's value of 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound can be considered a phenylmethanol, which has a melting point of around 30\u00b0C. The methoxy group introduces additional molecular weight and hydrogen bonding potential, raising the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The aldehyde group introduces a carbonyl functional group, which can participate in dipole interactions and increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
