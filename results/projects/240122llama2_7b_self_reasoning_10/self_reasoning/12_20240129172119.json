    "Reason": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline base, with a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom introduces a strong withdrawing group, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius. The hydrogen chloride can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group introduces additional rigidity, contributing approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, raising the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The tetrahydroisoquinoline base itself has a melting point of -106.0 degrees Celsius.",
