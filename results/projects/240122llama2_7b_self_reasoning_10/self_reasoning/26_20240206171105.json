    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one has a melting point that we can compare to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of two additional phenyl rings and a nitro group. Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The presence of two additional phenyl rings can also contribute to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +60\u00b0C per group, totaling +120\u00b0C.",
