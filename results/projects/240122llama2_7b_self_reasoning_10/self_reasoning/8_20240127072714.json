    "Reason": "1-Propyl substitution generally lowers the melting point compared to the base of acetate, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a propyl group introduces a bulky side chain, which reduces the ability of the carbonyl group to participate in hydrogen bonding. The reduced ability to form hydrogen bonds due to the increased molecular volume and rigidity of the side chain can lower the melting point. The exact impact depends on the specific compound and the extent of the propyl substitution.",
