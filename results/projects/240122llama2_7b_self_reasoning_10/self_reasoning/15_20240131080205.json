    "Reason": "4-cyano-4'-n-heptyloxybiphenyl has a melting point that we can compare to the melting point of benzene, which is around 5.5\u00b0C. The basic unit for our comparison will be the heptyloxy group, which introduces a hydroxyl functional group and a methyl-substituted phenyl group. The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl-substituted phenyl group introduces a rigid structure and additional molecular weight, which can contribute to the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The cyano group introduces a dipole, which can increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The biphenyl moiety introduces additional rigidity and pi-pi interactions, estimated at around +20\u00b0C for each additional fused ring.",
