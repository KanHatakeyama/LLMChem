    "Reason": "4-Fluorophenyl and trifluoromethyl groups increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The fluorine substituents also introduce a strong dipole moment, which raises the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The piperidine ring introduces a rigid structure and potential hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius. The carboxylate group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might lower the melting point by approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The presence of two fluorine substituents can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +20 degrees Celsius.",
