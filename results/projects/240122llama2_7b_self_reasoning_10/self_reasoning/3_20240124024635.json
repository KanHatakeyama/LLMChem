    "Reason": "2-Aminopropane has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be propane, which has a melting point of -18.7 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an amino group (NH2) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the nitrogen within the amino group also increases hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in propane, the additional nitrogen atom allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the amino group into consideration, we can predict a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with propane's hydrogen bonding alone.",
