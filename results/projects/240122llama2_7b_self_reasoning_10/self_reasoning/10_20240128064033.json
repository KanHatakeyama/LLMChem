    "Reason": "2-amino-3,5-dimethylphenyl and phenyl groups, when connected, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C due to the additional rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. The amino group introduces a basic nitrogen, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl groups can also contribute to the melting point due to their effect on the crystal lattice, estimated at around +5\u00b0C each.",
