    "Reason": "5-(4-morpholinyl)-2-nitrophenol has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for comparison is 2-nitrophenol, which has a melting point of around 10 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 5-(4-morpholinyl)-2-nitrophenol will affect its melting point: (1) The morpholinyl group (c1cc(c(cc1N2CCOCC2)O)) adds rigidity and molecular weight, estimated at around +20 degrees Celsius; (2) The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50 degrees Celsius.",
