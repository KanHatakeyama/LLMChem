    "Reason": "1,2-propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, 1-carbam has a melting point of 92 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be 1,2-propanediol, which has a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius. The methoxyphenoxy group (O=C(N1CCCC1)) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The carbamate group (1-carbam) adds approximately +20 degrees Celsius due to the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The methoxy group (\u2013O\u2013) reduces the melting point by approximately -2 degrees Celsius due to reduced hydrogen bonding. The thiolactone ring (\u2013C=S\u2013) adds approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to increased molecular weight and rigidity.",
