    "Reason": "1,1,1,3,3,3-hexadeutero-2-propanone has a melting point that can be predicted by considering its structural components. The basic unit for this compound is propanone, which has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The introduction of six deuterium atoms increases the molecular weight and rigidity, which raises the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
