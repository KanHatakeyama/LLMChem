    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is hexanoic acid, which has a melting point of -11.5\u00b0C. The presence of two ester groups can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated to add around +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the 2-ethyl-butyl group can also contribute to the melting point, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C.",
