    "Reason": "3,4-dimethyl-cis-2-pentene has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, cis-2-pentene, has a melting point of -109.4 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups increase the melting point due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and increase molecular weight. Each methyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 2 methyl groups) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
