    "Reason": "3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid has a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base melting point of benzene, which is around 5\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +40\u00b0C. The nitro group introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl ester group introduces a hydroxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The presence of two fused aromatic rings also raises the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions; this effect is estimated to add about +20\u00b0C for each additional fused ring.",
