    "Reason": "4-Chlorobenzilate compounds have a melting point influenced by functional groups relative to the base of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is the 4-chlorobenzene ring, which has a melting point of around 50 \u00b0C. The presence of two carbonyl groups generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 \u00b0C each. The chlorine atom introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C. The methyl group introduces a bulky side chain, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10 \u00b0C. Summing up these changes: 4-chlorobenzene base (+50\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and one methyl group (-10\u00b0C).",
