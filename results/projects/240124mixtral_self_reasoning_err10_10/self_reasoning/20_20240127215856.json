    "Reason": "2-fluorobenzotrifluoride is a derivative of benzotrifluoride, which has a melting point of -84.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a fluorine atom in the 2-position increases the melting point due to the electronegativity of fluorine, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (15 degrees Celsius x 3 fluorines) = 45 degrees Celsius.",
