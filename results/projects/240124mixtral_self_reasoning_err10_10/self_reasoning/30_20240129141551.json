    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be benzotrifluoride, which has a melting point of -46.0\u00b0C. The introduction of a fluorine atom in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. However, the fluorine atom also increases the electronegativity, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The net effect should thus be a slightly increased melting point due to the molecular size but a more significant increase due to the additional dipole-dipole interactions.",
