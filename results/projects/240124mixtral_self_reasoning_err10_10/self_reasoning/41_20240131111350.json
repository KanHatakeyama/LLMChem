    "Reason": "1,2-Ethanediamine has a melting point around 11\u00b0C. The introduction of two additional aminoethyl groups increases the molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point. Each aminoethyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C due to the additional hydrogen bonding potential. However, the presence of more flexible chains can also reduce the melting point due to a less compact molecular structure, which might decrease it by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: 1,2-Ethanediamine base (+11\u00b0C), two aminoethyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and a reduction due to the flexible chains (-10\u00b0C).",
