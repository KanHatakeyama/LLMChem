    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a hydrocarbon with a cyclic structure and a methyl substituent. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group in 1-methylcyclopentene increases the molecular weight and introduces a steric hindrance effect, which can slightly increase the melting point. However, the overall effect is minimal due to the relatively small size of the methyl group.",
