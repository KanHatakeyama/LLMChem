    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide has a basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a benzyl group (CH2C6H5) can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The thiosemicarbazide group (NNC(=S)N) has a significant impact due to the presence of a thiol group (-SH), which can participate in hydrogen bonding, and the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), which can also participate in hydrogen bonding. The thiosemicarbazide group can increase the melting point by approximately +100\u00b0C due to these interactions. However, the benzyl group can also participate in pi-stacking interactions, which can further increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The total estimated increase in melting point for 4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide is +130\u00b0C.",
