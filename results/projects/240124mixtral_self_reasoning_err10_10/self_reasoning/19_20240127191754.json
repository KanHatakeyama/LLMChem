    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is ammonia, which has a melting point of -77.9\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of eight methyl groups, two phosphoryl groups, and a cyclic structure. The methyl groups increase the molecular weight and add hydrophobic interactions, which can increase the melting point by approximately 10\u00b0C for each methyl group. The phosphoryl groups introduce a strong dipole, which can increase the melting point by approximately 50\u00b0C for each group. The cyclic structure increases the rigidity and symmetry, which can also increase the melting point.",
