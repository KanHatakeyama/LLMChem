    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene can be compared to 1-butene (with a melting point of -138.4\u00b0C). The presence of the cyclopentene ring increases the molecular rigidity and introduces a slight degree of ring strain. The methyl group also increases the molecular volume and adds a slight asymmetry to the molecule. The overall effect of these structural modifications is to increase the melting point compared to the linear 1-butene isomer. However, the exact impact of these changes is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. Cyclopentene ring: +10\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
