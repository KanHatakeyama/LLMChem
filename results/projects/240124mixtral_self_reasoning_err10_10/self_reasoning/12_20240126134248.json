    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a trimesic acid derivative with three phenyl rings connected by single bonds. To estimate the melting point, we can start with the melting point of benzene (5.5\u00b0C) and consider the effect of the additional phenyl rings. Each phenyl ring can contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C due to increased \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and molecular rigidity. The presence of three phenyl rings in 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl would lead to a significant increase in the melting point compared to benzene.",
