    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol is a derivative of ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group (-OCH3) in 2-Methoxyethanol increases the melting point due to the hydrogen bonding capability of the ether oxygen atom. The melting point increase can be estimated to be around 10-20\u00b0C.",
