    "Reason": "2-Pyridinecarboxamide, 3-hydroxy- is a derivative of pyridinecarboxamide, which has a melting point of 210-212\u00b0C. The presence of the hydroxy group (-OH) in the 3-position increases the hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. However, the hydroxy group also increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The net effect of the hydroxy group is a decrease in the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding potential. The estimated decrease is around -10\u00b0C.",
