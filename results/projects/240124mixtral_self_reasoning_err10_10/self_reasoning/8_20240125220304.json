    "Reason": "##The basic unit for this compound can be considered ethylenediamine (with a melting point of 11.3\u00b0C). The compound N,N'-Bis(2-aminoethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine has two additional ethylene diamine units connected through the amine groups. The introduction of these additional units increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of the additional amine groups also increases the hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in ethylenediamine, the additional amine groups allow for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the additional ethylene diamine units into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethylenediamine's hydrogen bonding alone.",
