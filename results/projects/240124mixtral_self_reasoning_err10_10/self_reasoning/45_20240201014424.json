    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has three benzene rings connected linearly, which significantly increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately +100 \u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and pi-stacking interactions.",
