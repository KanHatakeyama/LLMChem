    "Reason": "2-Pyridinecarboxamide, 3-hydroxy- has a basic unit of pyridinecarboxamide, which has a melting point around 190\u00b0C. The presence of a hydroxy group can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. However, the hydroxy group also introduces a more polar and asymmetric structure, which can reduce the crystal lattice stability, potentially decreasing the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Pyridinecarboxamide base (+190\u00b0C), hydroxy group (+10\u00b0C), and hydroxy group (-10\u00b0C).",
