    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine and fluorine atoms in the 3' and 4' positions, respectively, can affect the melting point due to the following factors: (1) The halogen atoms increase the molecular weight, which can slightly increase the melting point; (2) The halogen atoms can also increase the molecular rigidity due to their electronegativity, which can further increase the melting point; (3) The halogen atoms can participate in halogen bonding, which can increase the melting point due to additional intermolecular interactions.",
