    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a phenyl group, a sulfonyl group, and a pyrrole ring. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The phenyl group can increase the melting point due to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and molecular rigidity, contributing around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The sulfonyl group can increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C. The pyrrole ring can increase the melting point due to its aromaticity and ability to form weak hydrogen bonds, contributing around +10 to +20\u00b0C.",
