    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene can be compared to cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group increases molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces a slight increase in molecular asymmetry, which can slightly lower the melting point. The net effect should be a slightly increased melting point due to the methyl group.",
