    "Reason": "1,3-Benzenediimine (1,3-diaza-2,4-diene) has a melting point around -10\u00b0C. The presence of two propanedioate groups (O=C(OCC)C(=O)OCC) increases the molecular weight and introduces polar carbonyl interactions, which can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, adding approximately +100\u00b0C. The tetraethyl substitution increases the molecular volume and steric hindrance, which can lower the melting point due to a less compact crystal lattice, reducing it by approximately -20\u00b0C. Summing these modifications: 1,3-Benzenediimine base (-10\u00b0C), two propanedioate groups (+100\u00b0C), and tetraethyl substitution (-20\u00b0C).",
