    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of dextromoramide, we can start by considering the melting point of a basic aromatic system such as benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Then, we account for the following functional group effects:\n- Phenyl groups: The two phenyl rings should significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.\n- Amide groups: The two amide groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure as well, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each amide.\n- Tertiary amine: The tertiary amine group can also contribute to hydrogen bonding, adding around +10 to +20\u00b0C.\n- Methyl groups: The presence of methyl groups can slightly increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight, contributing around +5 to +10\u00b0C for each methyl group.\nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +60 to +100\u00b0C for the phenyl groups, +40 to +80\u00b0C for the amide groups, +10 to +20\u00b0C for the tertiary amine, and +10 to +20\u00b0C for the methyl groups.",
