    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile is a derivative of benzonitrile, which has a melting point of -13.2\u00b0C. The introduction of the trifluoromethyl group (\u2013CF3) increases the molecular weight and introduces a strong electron-withdrawing effect, which can increase the dipole moment and intermolecular forces. This effect can raise the melting point. However, the trifluoromethyl group is also relatively bulky, which can reduce the packing efficiency and lower the melting point. The net effect of the trifluoromethyl group is an increase in the melting point due to the increased dipole moment and intermolecular forces, but a smaller increase than might be expected due to the bulky nature of the group.",
