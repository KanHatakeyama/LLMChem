    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is composed of three benzene rings connected linearly. The melting point of benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. Each additional benzene ring increases the molecular weight and the pi-pi interactions, which in turn increases the melting point. The melting point increase due to the addition of each benzene ring is estimated to be around 100\u00b0C.",
