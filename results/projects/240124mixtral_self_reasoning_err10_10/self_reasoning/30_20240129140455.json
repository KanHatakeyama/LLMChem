    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a trimesic acid derivative with three benzene rings connected linearly. The melting point of benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The presence of two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion would notably augment the melting point.",
