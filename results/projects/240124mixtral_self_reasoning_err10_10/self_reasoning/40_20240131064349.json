    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the benzyl group also introduces a phenyl ring, which can increase pi-stacking interactions, further raising the melting point. The net effect of the benzyl group can be estimated to add about +25 degrees Celsius. The thiosemicarbazide group has a significant influence due to the presence of a thioamide group (\u2013NH\u2013CS\u2013NH\u2013) and two amide groups (\u2013NH\u2013CO\u2013). The thioamide group has a stronger dipole moment than the amide group, which can increase the melting point due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions. The two amide groups can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. The net effect of the thiosemicarbazide group can be estimated to add about +100 degrees Celsius.",
