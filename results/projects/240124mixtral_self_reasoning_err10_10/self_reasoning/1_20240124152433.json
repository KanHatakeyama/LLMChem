    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a derivative of cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5\u00b0C. The addition of a methyl group to the cyclopentene ring increases the molecular weight and adds a degree of asymmetry, which can lead to a slight increase in the melting point. However, the methyl group is relatively small and does not significantly alter the overall molecular structure. Therefore, the melting point increase should be minimal.",
