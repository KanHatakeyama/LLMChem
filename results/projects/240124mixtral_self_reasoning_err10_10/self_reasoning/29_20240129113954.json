    "Reason": "1,2-Ethanediamine has a melting point of 8.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two additional ethylamine groups increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of more amino groups increases the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the additional ethylamine groups into consideration, we can predict a net increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a slightly increased melting point compared to 1,2-ethanediamine.",
