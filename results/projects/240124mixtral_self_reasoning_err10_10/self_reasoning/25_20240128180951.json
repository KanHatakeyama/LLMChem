    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine and fluorine atoms in the 3' and 4' positions, respectively, can affect the melting point due to the following factors: (1) The halogen atoms increase the molecular weight, which can slightly increase the melting point; (2) The halogen atoms can also increase the molecular rigidity due to their electronegativity, which can further increase the melting point; (3) The halogen atoms can form weak hydrogen bonds with the amide group, which can also increase the melting point. The chlorine atom is more electronegative than the fluorine atom, so it can be expected to have a more significant effect on the melting point. The combined effect of the two halogen atoms can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10-15\u00b0C.",
