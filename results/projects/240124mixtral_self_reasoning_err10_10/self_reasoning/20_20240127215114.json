    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a trimesic acid derivative with three phenyl rings connected by two methylene bridges. The melting point of a basic aromatic system such as benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. Each phenyl group can significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. The methylene bridges can also increase the melting point due to the additional rigidity they introduce. We can estimate the contribution of each methylene bridge at around +10 to +20\u00b0C.",
