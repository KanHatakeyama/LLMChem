    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane is a perfluorinated compound, which means all hydrogen atoms in the ethane molecule are replaced by fluorine atoms. The presence of fluorine atoms in the molecule increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, fluorine is the most electronegative element, and the C-F bonds are highly polar. The polar nature of the C-F bonds can lead to stronger dipole-dipole interactions, which can lower the melting point compared to a non-polar molecule of similar size. The net effect of these changes is a slightly increased melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size, but a more significant decrease due to the stronger dipole-dipole interactions.",
