    "Reason": "##The basic unit for comparison can be considered ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of -83.6\u00b0C. The isopropyl group (\u2013C(CH3)2) in isopropyl acetate has a larger molecular volume and more branching compared to the ethyl group (\u2013CH2CH3) in ethyl acetate. This increased molecular volume and branching can lead to a higher melting point due to increased van der Waals forces and reduced molecular symmetry. However, the effect of branching is not as significant as the effect of molecular weight. The melting point increase due to the isopropyl group can be estimated to be around +10\u00b0C.",
