    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114\u00b0C. The presence of halogen atoms in the aromatic ring can increase the melting point due to the potential for halogen bonding and increased molecular rigidity. Fluorine and chlorine atoms typically increase the melting point by around +5 to +10\u00b0C each. However, the exact impact of halogen substitution is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. Halogen substitution: +10 to +20\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
