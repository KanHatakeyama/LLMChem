    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile is a derivative of benzonitrile, which has a melting point of -13.2\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group increases the melting point due to the electronegativity of fluorine, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15\u00b0C, giving a total increase of (15\u00b0C x 3 fluorines) = 45\u00b0C.",
