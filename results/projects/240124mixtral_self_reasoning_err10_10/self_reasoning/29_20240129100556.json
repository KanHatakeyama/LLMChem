    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a molecular weight of 76.11 g/mol, which is slightly higher than ethanol's 46.07 g/mol. The methoxy group (-OCH3) can form hydrogen bonds, which can lower the melting point due to increased solubility in the liquid phase. However, the methoxy group also increases molecular weight, which can raise the melting point. The net effect is a lower melting point compared to ethanol due to the increased hydrogen bonding potential, but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
