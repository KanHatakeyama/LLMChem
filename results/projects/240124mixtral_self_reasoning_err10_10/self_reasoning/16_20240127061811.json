    "Reason": "2-pyridinecarboxamide, 3-hydroxy- is a derivative of pyridinecarboxamide, which has a melting point of 180-182\u00b0C. The presence of the hydroxy group (-OH) in the 3-position can affect the melting point in two ways: (1) the hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxy group can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular interactions, and (2) the hydroxy group can increase the polarity and solubility of the compound, which can decrease the melting point due to the increased mobility of the molecules. The net effect of the hydroxy group is difficult to predict without experimental data, but we can estimate the effect based on the melting point of similar compounds. The presence of the hydroxy group in the 3-position can be expected to increase the melting point by around 10-20\u00b0C due to the hydrogen bonding capability.",
