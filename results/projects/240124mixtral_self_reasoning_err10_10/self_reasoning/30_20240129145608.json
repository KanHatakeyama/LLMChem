    "Reason": "2-pyridinecarboxamide, 3-hydroxy- is a derivative of pyridinecarboxamide, which has a melting point of 192-193\u00b0C. The presence of a hydroxy group (-OH) in the 3-position can affect the melting point in two ways: (1) The hydroxy group can form hydrogen bonds with the amide group, which can increase the melting point due to the additional hydrogen bonding. (2) The hydroxy group can also increase the hydrophilicity of the molecule, which can decrease the melting point due to the increased molecular motion. The net effect of the hydroxy group is difficult to predict without experimental data, but we can estimate the melting point based on the melting point of pyridinecarboxamide and the potential effects of the hydroxy group.",
