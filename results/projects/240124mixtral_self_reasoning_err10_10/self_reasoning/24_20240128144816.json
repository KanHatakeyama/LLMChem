    "Reason": "2-Pyridinecarboxamide, 3-hydroxy- has a basic unit of pyridinecarboxamide, which has a melting point around 190\u00b0C. The presence of a hydroxy group in the 3-position can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and additional dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. However, the hydroxy group can also introduce a more polar character, which can disrupt the crystal lattice stability, potentially lowering the melting point by approximately -5\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Pyridinecarboxamide base (+190\u00b0C), hydroxy group (+5\u00b0C), and polar character (-5\u00b0C).",
