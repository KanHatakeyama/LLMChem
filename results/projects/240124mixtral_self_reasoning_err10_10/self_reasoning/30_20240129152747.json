    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is methylamine, which has a melting point of -93.4\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phosphorus atom, a pyrophosphate group, and eight methyl groups. The phosphorus atom has a larger size and more electronegative character than a nitrogen atom, which can lead to stronger intermolecular interactions. The pyrophosphate group introduces a more rigid structure and additional electronegative atoms, which can increase the melting point due to increased dipole-dipole interactions. Each methyl group can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and hydrophobic interactions.",
