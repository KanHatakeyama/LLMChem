    "Reason": "4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone is a compound with a benzene ring, a ketone group, and a hydroxyl group. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a ketone group increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately 20 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group also increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about 10 degrees Celsius. The butyl group (CH3CH2CH2CH2) increases the molecular weight and volume, which can raise the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. Summing up these changes: Benzene base (+5.5 degrees Celsius), ketone group (+20 degrees Celsius), hydroxyl group (+10 degrees Celsius), and butyl group (+10 degrees Celsius).",
