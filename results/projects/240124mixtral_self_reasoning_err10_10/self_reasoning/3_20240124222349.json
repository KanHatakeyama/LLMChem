    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is composed of three benzene rings fused linearly. The melting point of benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. Each additional phenyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 100\u00b0C due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. In this case, we have two additional phenyl groups, which would add (100\u00b0C x 2) = 200\u00b0C to the melting point.",
