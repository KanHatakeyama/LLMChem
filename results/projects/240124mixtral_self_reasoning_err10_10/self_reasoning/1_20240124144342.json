    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol is a derivative of ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The addition of a methoxy group (OCH3) to ethanol increases the molecular weight and introduces a polar ether functionality, which can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The methoxy group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20\u00b0C.",
