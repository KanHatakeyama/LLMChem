    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile is a derivative of benzonitrile, which has a melting point of -13.2\u00b0C. The introduction of the trifluoromethyl group (\u2013CF3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of the highly electronegative fluorine atoms in the trifluoromethyl group also increases the polarizability of the molecule, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces and a higher melting point. The net effect should thus be an increased melting point compared to benzonitrile.",
