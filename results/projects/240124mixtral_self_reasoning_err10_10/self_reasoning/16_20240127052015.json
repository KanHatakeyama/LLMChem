    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a linear trimesic acid derivative. The melting point of trimesic acid is 298 \u00b0C, and the melting point of benzene is 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of the two additional phenyl rings in 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl increases the molecular weight and rigidity, which significantly raises the melting point. Each additional phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100 \u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
