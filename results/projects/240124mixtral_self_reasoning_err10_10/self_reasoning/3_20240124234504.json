    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile is a derivative of benzonitrile, which has a melting point of -13\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which increases the dipole moment and intermolecular forces. This is expected to increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
