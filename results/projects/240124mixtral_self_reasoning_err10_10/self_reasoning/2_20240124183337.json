    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane is a perfluorinated compound, which means all hydrogen atoms in the ethane molecule are replaced by fluorine atoms. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and its presence in a molecule significantly increases the melting point due to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius. Ethane has a melting point of -183.3 degrees Celsius, so we can calculate the melting point of 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane by adding the contribution of each fluorine atom.",
