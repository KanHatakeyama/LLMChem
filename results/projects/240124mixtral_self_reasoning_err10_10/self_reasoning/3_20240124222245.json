    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane is a perfluorinated compound, meaning all hydrogen atoms in the ethane molecule are replaced by fluorine atoms. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and its presence in a molecule significantly increases the melting point due to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The melting point of ethane is -172.0 degrees Celsius. Each fluorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius. Since there are five fluorine atoms in 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane, the total increase in the melting point would be (15 degrees Celsius x 5 fluorines) = 75 degrees Celsius.",
