    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole has a basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a phenyl group increases the melting point due to the enhancement of pi-pi interactions, molecular rigidity, and molecular weight. The additional imidazole ring also increases the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and its rigid structure. Each phenyl group can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The imidazole ring can be estimated to add around 50\u00b0C due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and its rigid structure.",
