    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a trimesic acid derivative with three phenyl rings connected by two methylene bridges. The melting point of this compound can be estimated by considering the melting points of its constituent parts and their interactions. The melting point of benzene is 5.5\u00b0C, and the addition of a methylene bridge to form biphenyl raises the melting point to 69-70\u00b0C. The presence of two methylene bridges in 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl further increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the additional intermolecular forces between the phenyl rings. The melting point of 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is expected to be significantly higher than that of biphenyl.",
