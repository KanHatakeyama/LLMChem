    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a hydrocarbon with a cyclic structure and a methyl substituent. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group in 1-methylcyclopentene increases the molecular weight and introduces a steric hindrance effect, which can slightly increase the melting point. However, the overall molecular symmetry is not significantly affected. The melting point increase due to the methyl group is estimated to be around +5\u00b0C.",
