    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is methylamine, which has a melting point of -93.4\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phosphorus atom, a pyrophosphate group, and eight methyl groups. The phosphorus atom has a larger size and more electronegative character than a nitrogen atom, which can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular interactions. The pyrophosphate group can also increase the melting point due to the presence of two phosphorus atoms, which can form stronger bonds with oxygen atoms, leading to more significant dipole-dipole interactions. The eight methyl groups can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for weak hydrogen bonding.",
