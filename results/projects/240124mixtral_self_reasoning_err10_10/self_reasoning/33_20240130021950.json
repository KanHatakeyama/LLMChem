    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a trimesic acid derivative with three phenyl rings connected by two methylene bridges. The basic unit for this compound can be considered benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the methylene bridges increases the molecular rigidity and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, which significantly raises the melting point. Each methylene bridge can add around +50 to +70\u00b0C to the melting point.",
