    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a derivative of cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5\u00b0C. The methyl substitution introduces a steric hindrance and increases the molecular weight, which can slightly increase the melting point. However, the overall structure remains relatively flexible and non-polar, so the increase should be minimal. We can estimate the impact of the methyl group to be around +5 to +10\u00b0C.",
