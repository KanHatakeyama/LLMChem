    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a molecular weight slightly higher than ethanol due to the presence of a methoxy group. The methoxy group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point compared to ethanol. However, the methoxy group also increases the molecular size, which can raise the melting point. The net effect is a lower melting point compared to ethanol due to the hydrogen bonding effect, but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
