    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile is a derivative of benzonitrile, which has a melting point of -13.2\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group (\u2013CF3) is a powerful electron-withdrawing group, which will increase the dipole moment of the molecule and enhance intermolecular forces. This effect will increase the melting point compared to the parent compound. The trifluoromethyl group is also relatively bulky, which can lead to a more rigid structure and further increase the melting point.",
