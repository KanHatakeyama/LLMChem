    "Reason": "2-pyridinecarboxamide, 3-hydroxy- is a derivative of pyridinecarboxamide, which has a melting point of 180-182\u00b0C. The presence of the hydroxy group (-OH) in the 3-position of the pyridine ring can affect the melting point in two ways: (1) the hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxy group, which can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular interactions, and (2) the potential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxy group and the amide carbonyl, which can decrease the melting point by reducing the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The net effect of the hydroxy group on the melting point is difficult to predict without experimental data or detailed computational studies. However, considering the hydrogen bonding potential, we can estimate a moderate increase in the melting point.",
