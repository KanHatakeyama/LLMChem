    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione consists of a piperazine ring with two carbonyl groups and an ethyl group. The piperazine ring has a melting point around 106\u00b0C. The carbonyl groups increase the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds, which might raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C each. However, the ethyl substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to piperazine, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Piperazine base (+106\u00b0C), two carbonyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and one ethyl group (-10\u00b0C).",
