    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a double bond increases the molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, which can raise the melting point by approximately +25\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl rings increases the molecular weight and pi-stacking interactions, which can further raise the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The methyl group increases the molecular weight and molecular size, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C.",
