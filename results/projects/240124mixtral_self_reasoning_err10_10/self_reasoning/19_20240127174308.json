    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol is a derivative of ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The addition of a methoxy group (-OCH3) increases the molecular weight and introduces a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, which can increase the melting point. The presence of a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor can increase the melting point by approximately 10-20\u00b0C.",
