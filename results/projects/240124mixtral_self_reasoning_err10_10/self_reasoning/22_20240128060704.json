    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine and fluorine atoms in the 3' and 4' positions, respectively, will affect the melting point due to the following factors: (1) The halogen atoms increase the molecular weight, which can increase the melting point; (2) The halogen atoms can form halogen bonds, which can increase the melting point due to additional intermolecular interactions; (3) The halogen atoms can also increase the molecular rigidity due to their electronegativity, which can increase the melting point. The chlorine atom is more electronegative than the fluorine atom, so it will have a more significant effect on the melting point. The presence of the halogen atoms in the 3' and 4' positions can be estimated to add approximately +10 to +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight, halogen bonds, and molecular rigidity.",
