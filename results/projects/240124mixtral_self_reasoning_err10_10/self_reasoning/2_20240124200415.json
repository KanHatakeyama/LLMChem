    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile is a compound with a trifluoromethyl group attached to a benzonitrile. The melting point of benzonitrile is -13\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which increases the melting point due to the increased intermolecular forces. The trifluoromethyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +30\u00b0C.",
