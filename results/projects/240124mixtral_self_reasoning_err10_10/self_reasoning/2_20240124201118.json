    "Reason": "1,2-Ethanediamine (ethylenediamine) has a melting point of 11\u00b0C. The introduction of two additional aminoethyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of the additional amino groups also increases the hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in ethylenediamine, the additional amino groups allow for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the aminoethyl groups into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethylenediamine's hydrogen bonding alone.",
