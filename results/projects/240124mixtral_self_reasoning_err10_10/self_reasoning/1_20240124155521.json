    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide is a compound with several functional groups that can influence its melting point. We can start by considering the melting point of a basic aromatic system such as benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Then, we account for the following functional group effects:\n- Phenyl group: The benzyl group has a phenyl ring, which should significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. This effect is estimated to add about +30 to +50\u00b0C.\n- Amide group: The amide group has the potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing around +20 to +30\u00b0C.\n- Thiosemicarbazide group: The thiosemicarbazide group has two amine groups and a thiol group, which can all participate in hydrogen bonding. This group can contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C due to the increased hydrogen bonding potential and molecular rigidity.\nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +30 to +50\u00b0C for the phenyl group, +20 to +30\u00b0C for the amide group, and +30 to +50\u00b0C for the thiosemicarbazide group.",
