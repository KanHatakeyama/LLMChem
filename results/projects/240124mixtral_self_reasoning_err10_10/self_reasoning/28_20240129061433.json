    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine and fluorine atoms in the 3' and 4' positions, respectively, can affect the melting point due to the following factors: (1) The halogen atoms increase the molecular weight, which can slightly increase the melting point; (2) The halogen atoms can also increase the molecular rigidity due to their electronegativity, which can further increase the melting point; (3) The halogen atoms can participate in halogen bonding, which can increase the melting point due to additional intermolecular interactions.\n\nConsidering these factors, we can estimate the melting point shift due to the halogen atoms: +5\u00b0C for the chlorine atom and +3\u00b0C for the fluorine atom. The total melting point shift is +8\u00b0C.",
