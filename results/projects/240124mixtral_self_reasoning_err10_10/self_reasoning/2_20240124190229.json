    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a hydrocarbon with a cyclic structure and a single methyl substituent. The basic unit for comparison is cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -138.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also increases the molecular volume and disrupts the packing of the molecules in the crystal lattice, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should thus be a slightly increased melting point compared to cyclopentene, but not as high as the increase observed with the methyl group alone.",
