    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane is a perfluorinated compound, meaning all hydrogen atoms in the ethane molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, which leads to strong intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15\u00b0C. In this case, there are five fluorine atoms, so the total increase would be (15\u00b0C x 5) = 75\u00b0C.",
