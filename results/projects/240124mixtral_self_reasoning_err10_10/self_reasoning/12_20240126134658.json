    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine and fluorine atoms in the 3' and 4' positions, respectively, will affect the melting point. Halogen atoms can increase the melting point due to their electronegativity, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces. The effect of halogen atoms on the melting point is generally as follows: fluorine > chlorine > bromine > iodine. In this case, we have a fluorine atom and a chlorine atom. The fluorine atom is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 5-10\u00b0C, while the chlorine atom is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 3-5\u00b0C.",
