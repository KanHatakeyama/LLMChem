The presence of three phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. Lastly, the hydrazono-functionalities and thiadiazole ring introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for three phenyl groups, we have +60\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +50\u00b0C, the carbonyl function at +30\u00b0C (lesser than a typical ketone due to conjugation and steric hindrance by the adjacent large groups), and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +40\u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system).

Then, we account for the following functional group effects:\n- Phenyl group: The benzyl group has a phenyl ring, which should significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. This effect is estimated to add about +30 to +50\u00b0C.\n- Amide group: The amide group has the potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing around +20 to +30\u00b0C.\n- Thiosemicarbazide group: The thiosemicarbazide group has two amine groups and a thiol group, which can all participate in hydrogen bonding. This group can contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C due to the increased hydrogen bonding potential and molecular rigidity.\nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +30 to +50\u00b0C for the phenyl group, +20 to +30\u00b0C for the amide group, and +30 to +50\u00b0C for the thiosemicarbazide group.",

The benzyl group, a derivative of benzene, has a melting point of -13 \u00b0C.

The thiosemicarbazide group (\u2013NH\u2013CSNH\u2013) also contributes to the melting point by forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increasing molecular weight.

In the case of 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane, the steric hindrance and repulsion between the lone pairs of electrons on the fluorine atoms are expected to be more pronounced due to the presence of five fluorine atoms.
