The melting point of 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is expected to be higher than biphenyl due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of more aromatic rings. The melting point increase can be estimated by considering the melting point difference between benzene and biphenyl, which is approximately 64\u00b0C. Since 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl has one more phenyl ring than biphenyl, we can estimate the melting point increase to be around 64\u00b0C * (1/2) = 32\u00b0C.
