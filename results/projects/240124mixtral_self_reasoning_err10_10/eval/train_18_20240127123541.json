The effect of chlorine is more significant than fluorine due to its larger size and stronger electron-withdrawing ability.\n- Steric hindrance: The halogen atoms in the ortho positions can introduce steric hindrance, which can affect the packing of the molecules in the crystal lattice and thus the melting point.\n- Electronic effects: The halogen atoms can also affect the electronic properties of the phenyl ring, which can influence the intermolecular interactions and thus the melting point.\nConsidering these factors, the presence of the halogen atoms should increase the melting point of acetanilide.
