The presence of a benzyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the benzyl group also introduces a phenyl ring, which can increase pi-stacking interactions, further raising the melting point. The net effect of the benzyl group can be estimated to add about +25 degrees Celsius. The thiosemicarbazide group has a significant influence due to the presence of a thioamide group (\u2013NH\u2013CS\u2013NH\u2013) and two amide groups (\u2013NH\u2013CO\u2013). The thioamide group has a stronger dipole moment than the amide group, which can increase the melting point due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions.
