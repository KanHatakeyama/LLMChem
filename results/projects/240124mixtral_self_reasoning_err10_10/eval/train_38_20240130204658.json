Phenyl groups, when connected to a benzene ring, tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl, we have two additional phenyl rings linked in a linear fashion, which would notably augment the melting point.
