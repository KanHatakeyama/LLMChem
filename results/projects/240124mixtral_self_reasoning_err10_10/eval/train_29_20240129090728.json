The presence of three phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. Lastly, the hydrazono-functionalities and thiadiazole ring introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for three phenyl groups, we have +60\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +50\u00b0C, the carbonyl function at +30\u00b0C (lesser than a typical ketone due to conjugation and steric hindrance by the adjacent large groups), and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +40\u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system).
