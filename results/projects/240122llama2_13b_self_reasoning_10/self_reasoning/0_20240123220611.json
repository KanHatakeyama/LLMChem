    "Reason": "2,2-dimethyl propanoic acid has a melting point of 48\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is acetic acid, which has a melting point of 16.6\u00b0C. The methyl groups in 2,2-dimethyl propanoic acid increase the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which can raise the melting point. The carboxylic acid functional group also increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. The total increase in melting point due to these modifications is approximately +30\u00b0C.",
