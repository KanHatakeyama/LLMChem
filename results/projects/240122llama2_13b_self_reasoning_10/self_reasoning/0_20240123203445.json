    "Reason": "The compound under consideration contains a basic unit of analysis, which is the amide group (-NH-CO-), which has a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C. The presence of the acetyl group (-COCH3) will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and hydrophobic interactions. The hydroxy group (-OH) will also increase the melting point due to the increased polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity. The trans-isomer will have a slightly lower melting point compared to the cis-isomer due to the reduced steric hindrance and increased molecular flexibility.",
