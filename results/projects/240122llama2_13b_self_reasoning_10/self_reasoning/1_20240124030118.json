    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a melting point of 120\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is acetanilide, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The chlorine and fluorine substituents increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and ability to form strong intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The chlorine substituent increases the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C, while the fluorine substituent increases it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The total increase is +30\u00b0C.",
