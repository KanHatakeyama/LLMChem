    "Reason": "The melting point of N-boc-3-(2-thienyl)-L-alanine can be estimated based on the functional groups present and their contributions to the overall melting point. \n- The thienyl group: The presence of a thienyl group can introduce a significant increase in melting point due to the aromatic nature of the group and the potential for hydrogen bonding. A rough estimate for the thienyl group is +20\u00b0C. \n- The L-alanine group: The L-alanine group is a polar, hydrophilic group that can introduce a significant increase in melting point due to hydrogen bonding. A rough estimate for the L-alanine group is +20\u00b0C. \n- The Boc group: The Boc group is a tertiary alkyl group that can introduce a moderate increase in melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size. A rough estimate for the Boc group is +10\u00b0C. \n- The amide linkage: The amide linkage can introduce a moderate increase in melting point due to hydrogen bonding. A rough estimate for the amide linkage is +10\u00b0C. \nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to estimate the melting point of N-boc-3-(2-thienyl)-L-alanine: +20 +20 +10 +10 = 60\u00b0C.",
