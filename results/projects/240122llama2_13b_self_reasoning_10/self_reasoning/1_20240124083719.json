    "Reason": "3-methyl-butyraldehyde oxime has a melting point that can be estimated based on the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit of analysis is butyraldehyde, which has a melting point of 20\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group increases the melting point by about +5\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The oxime group (-NO) introduces a nitrogen atom that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. The total estimated increase is +25\u00b0C.",
