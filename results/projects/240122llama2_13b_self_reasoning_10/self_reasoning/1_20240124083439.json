    "Reason": "The melting point of N,N'-diacetylethylenediamine can be estimated based on the following considerations: \n1. Amino group: The presence of two amino groups can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and the rigidity introduced by the peptide bond. Each amino group may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \n2. Ether linkage: The ether linkage between the two amino groups can also increase the melting point due to the rigidity it introduces. This may contribute around +10 to +20\u00b0C. \n3. Acetyl groups: The two acetyl groups can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the hydrophobic effect. Each acetyl group may contribute around +5 to +10\u00b0C. \nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to estimate the melting point: +20 to +30\u00b0C for the amino groups, +10 to +20\u00b0C for the ether linkage, and +5 to +10\u00b0C for the acetyl groups.",
