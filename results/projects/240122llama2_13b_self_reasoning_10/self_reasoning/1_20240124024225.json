    "Reason": "Dextromoramide is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups that influence its melting point. The base unit for comparison can be the amide group, which typically has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The presence of two methyl groups and a methoxy group increases the molecular weight and size, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The two phenyl groups introduce a significant increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which can contribute to an increase of +50\u00b0C per group, totaling +100\u00b0C. The tertiary amine group can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The presence of the cyclohexyl group introduces a more rigid structure, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The sulfonamide group introduces a strong dipole and hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The presence of the cyclohexyl group and the sulfonamide group can also increase the melting point due to their rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential.",
