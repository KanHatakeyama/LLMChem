    "Reason": "1,2,3,5-tetraiodobenzene is a highly polar molecule due to the presence of four iodine atoms, which introduces a significant dipole moment. This results in strong intermolecular forces and a high melting point. The molecular weight of the compound is also relatively high due to the presence of four iodine atoms, which further contributes to the high melting point. Additionally, the rigidity of the molecule due to the planar, unsaturated ring structure also contributes to the high melting point.",
