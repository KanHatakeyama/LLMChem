    "Reason": "5-bromoindole has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The basic unit for this compound is indole, which has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The presence of a bromine atom increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +6\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group on the indole ring may also increase the melting point by approximately +2\u00b0C due to the additional molecular weight and rigidity.",
