    "Reason": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a lipid mediator that plays a crucial role in inflammation and pain. The basic unit of analysis for PGE2 is the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which is responsible for converting arachidonic acid into PGE2. The melting point of PGE2 is around 70-80\u00b0C. The presence of the carbonyl group in the molecule increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The methyl group on the nitrogen atom also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, the presence of the ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) has a slight lowering effect because it does not participate in hydrogen bonding as intensely as a hydroxyl group would.",
