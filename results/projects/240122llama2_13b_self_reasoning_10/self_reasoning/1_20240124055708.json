    "Reason": "Penicillamine is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups that can affect its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is cysteine, which has a melting point of 180\u00b0C. The presence of the sulfur atom in the thiol group increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The amide group also contributes to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of the phenyl group increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The presence of the methyl group decreases the melting point due to the reduced polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. The net effect is an increase in the melting point due to the sulfur and amide groups, partially offset by the decreasing effect of the methyl group.",
