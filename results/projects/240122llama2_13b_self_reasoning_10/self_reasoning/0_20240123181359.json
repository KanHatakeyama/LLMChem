    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a type of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) that contains a fused benzene ring system. The basic unit for this compound is the benzene ring, which has a melting point of approximately 180 degrees Celsius. The fused ring system increases the molecular weight and rigidity of the molecule, which will increase the melting point. Additionally, the presence of the bulky phenyl groups will also increase the melting point due to steric hindrance and intermolecular dispersion forces.",
