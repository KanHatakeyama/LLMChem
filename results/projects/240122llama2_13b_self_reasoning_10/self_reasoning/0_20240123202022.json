    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is the sulfonamide ring, which has a melting point of around 180-190\u00b0C. The presence of the sulfonamide ring and the methoxy group increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The presence of the dimethyl group also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size. The presence of the sulfur atom also increases the melting point due to the increased polarizability and the potential for hydrogen bonding.",
