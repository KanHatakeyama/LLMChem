    "Reason": "The melting point of (e)-alpha-methylstilbene can be predicted based on the functional groups present and their effects on the molecular structure. The basic unit for this compound is stilbene, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) can lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and reduced rigidity. The methyl group (-CH3) can also lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the reduced polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity. The total change in melting point due to these functional groups is approximately -20\u00b0C.",
