    "Reason": "4-(4-morpholinylmethyl)benzoic acid has a melting point of 180-185 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122 degrees Celsius. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a morpholinylmethyl group and a carboxylic acid group. The morpholinylmethyl group can be estimated to add approximately 20-30 degrees Celsius due to the increased hydrogen bonding potential and the rigidity of the structure. The carboxylic acid group can be estimated to add approximately 10-20 degrees Celsius due to the increased acidity and the ability to form hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the total estimated melting point shift for 4-(4-morpholinylmethyl)benzoic acid is approximately 50-70 degrees Celsius.",
