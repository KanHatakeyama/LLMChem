    "Reason": "The melting point of p-chlorophenol can be estimated based on the following factors: (1) The basic unit, phenol, has a melting point of 48 degrees Celsius. (2) The chlorine substitution increases the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. (3) The p-position of the chlorine group may add an additional +2 degrees Celsius due to the increased steric hindrance and the potential for increased hydrogen bonding.",
