    "Reason": "2-amino-4-methoxybenzothiazole has a melting point of 140 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison is 2-aminothiazole, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of the methoxy group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. The amino group also increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. The net effect should be an increase in the melting point due to the methoxy group and a smaller increase due to the amino group.",
