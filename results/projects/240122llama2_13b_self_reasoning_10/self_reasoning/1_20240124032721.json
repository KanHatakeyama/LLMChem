    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is phenol, which has a melting point of 48\u00b0C. Bromination generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The presence of a methyl group may also increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity. The tetrabromo substitution will increase the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C due to the potential for additional hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. Summing up these changes: Phenol base (+48\u00b0C), methyl group (+5\u00b0C), and four bromine groups (+40\u00b0C).",
