    "Reason": "1,2-dichloroethene (cis) is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms. The basic unit for comparison is ethylene, which has a melting point of -169.4\u00b0C. The presence of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the chlorine atoms also introduce polar and electronegative functionalities that can increase intermolecular forces and the melting point. The cis configuration of the double bond may also affect the melting point, potentially leading to a higher melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and rigidity of the molecule. Taking these factors into account, we can predict an increase in the melting point compared to ethylene, but not as high as the increase observed with chloroform.",
