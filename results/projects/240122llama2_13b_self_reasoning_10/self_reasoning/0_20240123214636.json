    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is ethanedione, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The presence of two furanyl groups and a dioxime group will increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The furanyl groups may contribute around +10\u00b0C each, while the dioxime group may contribute around +20\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Ethanedione base (+106\u00b0C), two furanyl groups (+20\u00b0C), and dioxime group (+20\u00b0C).",
