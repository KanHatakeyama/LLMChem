    "Reason": "3-pentanol, 3-methyl- has a melting point of 45-50 degrees Celsius. The carbamate functional group increases the melting point due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The 3-methyl group also increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and size. The basic unit for comparison is 3-pentanol, which has a melting point of 45-50 degrees Celsius. The carbamate group increases the melting point by about +10 degrees Celsius, and the 3-methyl group increases it by about +5 degrees Celsius.",
