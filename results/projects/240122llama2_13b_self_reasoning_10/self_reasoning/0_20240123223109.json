    "Reason": "5-furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that influence its melting point. The furfuryl group introduces a large, non-polar, hydrophobic moiety that can increase the melting point due to reduced solubility and hydrophobic interactions. The isopropyl group also increases the molecular weight and size, which can contribute to a higher melting point. The barbituric acid moiety introduces a negatively charged sulfonate group, which can increase the melting point due to increased intermolecular interactions. However, the presence of the negatively charged group can also reduce the melting point due to increased hydrophilicity. The net effect of these functional groups is expected to increase the melting point, but the exact amount is difficult to predict.",
