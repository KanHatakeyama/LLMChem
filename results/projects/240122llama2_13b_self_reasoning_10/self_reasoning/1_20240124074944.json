    "Reason": "The melting point of bis(2-chloroethyl)ethylamine can be estimated based on the following considerations: (1) The basic unit for comparison is ethylamine, which has a melting point of -23.0\u00b0C. (2) The presence of two chloroethyl groups increases the molecular weight and size of the molecule, which generally raises the melting point. Each chloroethyl group can be estimated to add approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and size. (3) The presence of two chlorine atoms increases the polarity of the molecule, which can enhance hydrogen bonding and further raise the melting point. Each chlorine atom can be estimated to add approximately +5\u00b0C due to increased hydrogen bonding potential. (4) The ethylamine functional group may also contribute to hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point.",
