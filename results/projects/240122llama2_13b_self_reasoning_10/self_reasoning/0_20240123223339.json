    "Reason": "1,2,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran is a highly polar molecule with a high molecular weight due to the presence of five chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms introduce strong electronegative atoms that increase the polarity of the molecule and enhance intermolecular forces. The furan ring also introduces a rigid structure that can participate in dipole interactions. The melting point of this compound is expected to be high due to the strong intermolecular forces and the rigid structure.",
