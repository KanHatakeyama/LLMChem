    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is ethyl acetate, which has a melting point of 55.6 degrees Celsius. The presence of the methyl group increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and size, which can raise it by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group also increases the melting point due to potential hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The total increase is estimated to be around +15 degrees Celsius.",
