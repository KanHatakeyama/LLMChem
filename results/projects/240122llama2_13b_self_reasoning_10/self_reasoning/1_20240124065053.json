    "Reason": "5-furfuryl-5-isopropylbarbituric acid has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that influence its melting point. The furfuryl group introduces a rigid structure and a hydrophobic effect, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The isopropyl group also contributes to increased hydrophobicity and molecular weight, adding another +10\u00b0C. The barbituric acid moiety introduces a carbonyl group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to dipole-dipole interactions. Additionally, the acidic functional group can increase the melting point by +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and potential hydrogen bonding. The total predicted increase is +60\u00b0C.",
