    "Reason": "3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid has a melting point of 180 degrees Celsius. The presence of two sulfur atoms introduces strong dipole-dipole interactions, which increase the melting point by approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid functional groups also contribute to the melting point by introducing hydrogen bonding and increasing the molecular weight, which adds an additional 20 degrees Celsius. The rigid structure of the molecule also contributes to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, adding approximately 50 degrees Celsius.",
