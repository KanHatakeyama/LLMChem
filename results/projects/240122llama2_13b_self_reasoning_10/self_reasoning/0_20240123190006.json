    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide contains several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit of analysis is the thiosemicarbazide moiety, which has a melting point of around 100-110\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding and rigidity. The presence of a benzyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which can raise the melting point. However, the benzyl group also introduces a bulky, non-polar functional group that may reduce the hydrogen bonding potential and lower the melting point. The carbonyl group in the thiosemicarbazide moiety can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which may slightly increase the melting point.",
