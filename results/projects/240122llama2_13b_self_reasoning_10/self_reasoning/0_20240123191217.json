    "Reason": "The melting point of (e)-alpha-methylstilbene can be predicted based on the functional groups present and their effects on the molecular structure. The basic unit for comparison can be stilbene, which has a melting point of 100-110\u00b0C. The presence of an alkyl group (methyl) on the alpha-carbon generally lowers the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and reduced polarity, which can decrease it by approximately -10\u00b0C. The two phenyl rings in the molecule can also increase the melting point due to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and rigidity, which can add around +20\u00b0C for each ring. The total effect should be: Stilbene base (+100-110\u00b0C), alkyl group (-10\u00b0C), and two phenyl groups (+20\u00b0C).",
