    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is the aspartic acid, which has a melting point of 165-170\u00b0C. The presence of the benzyloxycarbonyl group (-O-C6H5-O-C(=O)-O) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of the ester linkage (-O-C(=O)-O) reduces the melting point due to the lack of hydrogen bonding potential. The benzyloxycarbonyl group also increases the hydrophobicity of the molecule, which might further lower the melting point.",
