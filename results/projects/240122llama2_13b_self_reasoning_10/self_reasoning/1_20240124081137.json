    "Reason": "2-{[(pyridin-2-ylamino)methyl]amino}naphthalene-1,4-dione has a melting point influenced by the functional groups and the naphthalene base. The pyridine ring introduces a basic unit with a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The naphthalene ring increases the molecular weight and introduces a rigid structure, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The amino group introduces hydrogen bonding and a slight increase in molecular weight, adding about +10\u00b0C. The methyl group substitution may reduce the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C due to the increased steric hindrance and reduced intermolecular interactions. The total estimated melting point shift is: Pyridine base (+100\u00b0C), naphthalene ring (+20\u00b0C), amino group (+10\u00b0C), and methyl group (-10\u00b0C).",
