    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is oleic acid, which has a melting point of 13.8\u00b0C. The methyl group substitution increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which generally lowers the melting point. However, the presence of a methyl group also reduces the polarity of the molecule, which can counteract the effect of increased molecular weight. The net effect is a decrease in melting point, but not as low as the decrease observed with oleic acid alone.",
