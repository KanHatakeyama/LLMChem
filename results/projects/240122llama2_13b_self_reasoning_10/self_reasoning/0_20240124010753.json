    "Reason": "The melting point of p-chlorophenol can be estimated based on the following considerations:\n1. Chlorine substitution: The presence of a chlorine atom on the phenol ring can increase the melting point due to the electronegativity of chlorine and the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the chlorine and hydroxyl groups. This effect can be estimated to add approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point.\n2. Phenolic hydroxyl group: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group can also increase the melting point due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group and the chlorine atom. This effect can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point.\n3. Molecular weight: The molecular weight of p-chlorophenol is higher than that of phenol due to the presence of a chlorine atom. This increased molecular weight can contribute to a higher melting point, but the exact amount is difficult to estimate without experimental data.",
