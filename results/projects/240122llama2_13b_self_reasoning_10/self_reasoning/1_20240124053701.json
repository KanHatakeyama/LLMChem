    "Reason": "The melting point of p-cyanophenol can be estimated based on the following considerations: \n- Phenolic hydroxyl group: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group can increase the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and the rigidity it introduces, which can contribute around +20\u00b0C. \n- Cyano group: The cyano group can also form strong hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point by around +20\u00b0C. \n- Molecular weight: The molecular weight of p-cyanophenol is higher than that of phenol due to the presence of the cyano group, which can also contribute to an increased melting point. \nGiven these considerations, we can estimate the melting point of p-cyanophenol to be around +40\u00b0C higher than that of phenol.",
