    "Reason": "Penicillamine has a melting point of 180-185 degrees Celsius. The basic unit for comparison can be caffeine, which has a melting point of 238 degrees Celsius. The sulfur atom in penicillamine introduces a polar functional group that increases the molecular weight and size, raising the melting point. The presence of the amine group also increases the hydrogen bonding potential, which can further raise the melting point. The net effect is an increase in the melting point due to the introduction of the sulfur and amine functional groups.",
