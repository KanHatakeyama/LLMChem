    "Reason": "Chlorimipramine contains several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit of analysis is the piperidine ring, which has a melting point of around 50\u00b0C due to its rigidity and ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The presence of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to form dipole interactions. The two methyl groups may increase the melting point by about +5\u00b0C each due to their ability to increase molecular weight and reduce the polarity of the molecule. The two nitrogen atoms also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase the molecular weight. The presence of a carbonyl group may increase the melting point by about +20\u00b0C due to the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase the molecular weight. The chlorine atom may also increase the melting point by about +20\u00b0C due to the ability to form dipole interactions. The total predicted increase in melting point is around +120\u00b0C.",
