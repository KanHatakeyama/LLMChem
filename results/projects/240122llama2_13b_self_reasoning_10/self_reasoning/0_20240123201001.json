    "Reason": "The melting point of methyl_4-phenylbenzoate can be predicted based on the functional groups present in the molecule. The benzene ring is a planar, aromatic ring that is relatively rigid and stable, which contributes to a higher melting point. The methyl group is a non-polar, hydrophobic group that does not participate in hydrogen bonding, which has a negligible effect on the melting point. The carboxylic acid group (-COO-) is a polar functional group that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point. The phenyl group is a large, bulky group that can increase the van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding potential, further increasing the melting point. The methyl group and the phenyl group have a synergistic effect, increasing the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
