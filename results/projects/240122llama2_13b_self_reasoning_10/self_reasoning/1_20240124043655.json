    "Reason": "The melting point of xanthene, an organic compound with various functional groups can be considered as follows: The basic unit we can compare to is naphthalene which has a melting point of around 80 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in xanthene will affect its melting point: (1) The fused-ring structure of xanthene increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions, estimated to add about +20; (2) The presence of a carbonyl group can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated to add about +5; (3) The presence of a methyl group can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated to add about +2; (4) The presence of a hydroxyl group can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and possible hydrogen bonding, estimated to add about +2. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
