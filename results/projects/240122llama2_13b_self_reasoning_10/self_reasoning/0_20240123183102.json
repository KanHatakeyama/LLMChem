    "Reason": "Zonisamide is a sulfonamide drug with a unique molecular structure that includes a sulfur atom and a nitrogen atom. To predict its melting point, we can consider the melting point of a basic aromatic system such as benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Then, we account for the following functional group effects: \n- Sulfonamide group: The sulfonamide group is a strong electronegative functional group that can increase the melting point due to its ability to form strong hydrogen bonds. This group may contribute around +50 to +100\u00b0C. \n- Nitrogen atom: The nitrogen atom can also participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point, contributing around +20 to +50\u00b0C. \n- Aromatic rings: The two aromatic rings in zonisamide can enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity, contributing around +30 to +50\u00b0C. \n- Methyl group: The methyl group may reduce the melting point slightly due to its relatively small size and lack of electronegativity, subtracting around -5 to -10\u00b0C. \nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +60 to +100\u00b0C for the sulfonamide group, +20 to +50\u00b0C for the nitrogen atom, +30 to +50\u00b0C for the aromatic rings, and -5 to -10\u00b0C for the methyl group.",
