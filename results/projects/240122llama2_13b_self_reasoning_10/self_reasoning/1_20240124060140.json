    "Reason": "The melting point of diphenyl terephthalate can be estimated by considering the contributions of the functional groups and structural features present in the molecule. The basic unit we can compare to is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Phenyl groups: The two phenyl groups can increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. \n- Carbonyl groups: The two carbonyl groups (one from the terephthalate and one from the diphenyl group) can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure as well, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl. \n- Ester linkage: The ester linkage between the terephthalate and the diphenyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, contributing around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \n- Phthalate group: The phthalate group can introduce additional hydrogen bonding and rigidity, contributing around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +60 to +100\u00b0C for the phenyl groups, +40 to +80\u00b0C for the carbonyl groups, +20 to +30\u00b0C for the ester linkage, and +20 to +30\u00b0C for the phthalate group.",
