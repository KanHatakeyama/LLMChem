    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol is a simple alcohol with a methoxy group attached to the carbon atom. The methoxy group is a polar functional group that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. The basic unit for comparison is ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The methoxy group can increase the melting point by approximately 10-20\u00b0C due to the hydrogen bonding potential.",
