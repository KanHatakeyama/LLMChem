    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be methane, which has a melting point of -161.5 degrees Celsius. The trifluoromethyl group (FC(F)F) increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the fluorine atoms also increase the electronegativity and polarizability, which can enhance the London dispersion forces and dipole-dipole interactions, leading to a higher melting point. The total increase in melting point due to the trifluoromethyl group can be estimated to be around +20 degrees Celsius.",
