    "Reason": "2-pyridinecarboxamide is the basic unit for this compound, which has a melting point of 160-165\u00b0C. The presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH) generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The pyridine ring introduces a rigid structure and pi-pi interactions, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carboxamide group may also contribute to the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: 2-pyridinecarboxamide base (+160-165\u00b0C), hydroxyl group (+10\u00b0C), and pi-pi interactions (+20\u00b0C).",
