    "Reason": "2-(2-chlorophenoxy)ethylamine contains functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit of analysis is the ethylamine moiety, which has a melting point of 35.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a chlorine atom in the phenoxy group increases the molecular weight and potentially raises the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius. The amine group can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The ether linkage does not participate in hydrogen bonding as intensely as an amine group, but it does increase the molecular weight, which might minutely raise the melting point. The chlorine atom can also increase the melting point by about +5 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight and potential for intermolecular interactions.",
