    "Reason": "Embelin is a natural product with a complex molecular structure that contains various functional groups, including a phenolic hydroxyl, an aldehyde, a ketone, and a tertiary amine. The melting point of embelin can be estimated by considering the effects of these functional groups on the molecular structure and intermolecular interactions.\n\nThe phenolic hydroxyl group can contribute to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and polarity of the molecule, potentially adding around +5 to +10\u00b0C. The aldehyde group can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which can increase the melting point by approximately +5 to +10\u00b0C as well. The ketone group can also participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, contributing an additional +5 to +10\u00b0C.\n\nThe tertiary amine group can increase the melting point by enhancing the molecular rigidity and steric hindrance, potentially adding around +10 to +20\u00b0C. The presence of a tertiary amine can also increase the polarity of the molecule, which can contribute to the melting point.\n\nConsidering the effects of these functional groups, we can estimate the melting point of embelin to be around 150 to 170\u00b0C.",
