    "Reason": "The melting point of n-hexyl acetate can be estimated by comparing it to the melting point of acetone, which is around -21\u00b0C. The n-hexyl group is a long, nonpolar hydrocarbon chain that can increase the melting point due to its size and rigidity. The presence of the acetate group can also increase the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds. The total increase in melting point due to these functional groups can be estimated as follows:\n* n-hexyl group: +20\u00b0C (for the size and rigidity effect)\n* acetate group: +20\u00b0C (for the hydrogen bonding effect)\nTotal increase: +40\u00b0C",
