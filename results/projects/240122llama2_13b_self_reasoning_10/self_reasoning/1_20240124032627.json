    "Reason": "1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)cyanuric acid contains functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit of analysis is cyanuric acid, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The presence of three hydroxyethyl groups increases the melting point due to the additional hydrogen bonding potential and molecular weight, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C each. The carbonyl group introduces a dipole and can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The total predicted increase is +60\u00b0C.",
