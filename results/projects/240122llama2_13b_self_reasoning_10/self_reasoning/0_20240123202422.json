    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one has a melting point that can be predicted based on the functional groups present. The presence of a nitro group increases the melting point due to the strong electronegativity and polarizability of the nitro functional group. The phenyl groups also increase the melting point due to the large size and hydrophobic nature of the groups. The indole ring introduces a planar, aromatic structure that can participate in hydrogen bonding and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, which can increase the melting point. The carbonyl group also introduces a polar functional group that can participate in dipole-dipole interactions. The total increase in melting point due to these functional groups can be estimated as follows: Nitro group: +50\u00b0C, Phenyl groups: +30\u00b0C, Indole ring: +20\u00b0C, Carbonyl group: +10\u00b0C.",
