    "Reason": "The melting point of tris(3-methoxyphenyl)phosphine can be estimated by considering the effects of the functional groups and the basic unit of phosphine. \n- Phenyl groups: The three phenyl groups can increase the melting point due to their ability to form \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and increase the molecular weight. Each phenyl group may contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \n- Methoxy groups: The three methoxy groups can decrease the melting point due to the presence of the bulky methyl group, which can reduce the strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Each methoxy group may subtract around -10 to -20\u00b0C. \n- Phosphine linkage: The phosphine linkage can form strong hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point. This effect can be estimated at around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to the melting point: +60 to +90\u00b0C for the phenyl groups, -30 to -60\u00b0C for the methoxy groups, and +20 to +30\u00b0C for the phosphine linkage.",
