    "Reason": "1,2,3,5-tetraiodobenzene has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The iodine substituents increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of strong electronegative atoms. Each iodine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 4 iodine atoms) = 40 degrees Celsius.",
