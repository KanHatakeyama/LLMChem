    "Reason": "The melting point of p-acetylstyrene can be estimated by comparing it to the parent compound styrene, which has a melting point of 25\u00b0C. The p-acetyl group introduces a bulky, non-polar functional group that increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the acetyl group also introduces a hydrophobic effect, which can reduce the melting point due to the weaker intermolecular forces. The net effect should be an increase in melting point due to the larger size and molecular weight but a decrease due to the hydrophobic effect.",
