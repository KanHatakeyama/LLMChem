    "Reason": "1-ethylpiperazine-2,3-dione has a melting point of 106\u00b0C due to the presence of two carbonyl groups, which can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl. The ethyl group may decrease the melting point by around -10\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and reduced symmetry. The piperazine base contributes around +106\u00b0C.",
