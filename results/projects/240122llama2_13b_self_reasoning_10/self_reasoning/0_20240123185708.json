    "Reason": "2-pyridinecarboxamide has a melting point of 178.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) increases the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds. The pyridine ring also increases the melting point due to its aromaticity and planarity, which enhances intermolecular interactions. The amide linkage also contributes to the melting point due to the formation of hydrogen bonds.",
