    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide has a melting point of 140.0 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzyl group increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The thiosemicarbazide functional group introduces a sulfur atom and a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, increasing the melting point by approximately +40 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The total increase in melting point is approximately +90 degrees Celsius.",
