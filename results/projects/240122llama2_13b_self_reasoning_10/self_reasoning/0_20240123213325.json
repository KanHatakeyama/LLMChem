    "Reason": "The melting point of N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide can be estimated by analyzing the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule. The trifluoromethyl group increases the molecular weight and size of the molecule, which generally raises the melting point. The presence of the ethoxyphenyl group also increases the molecular weight and size, which further raises the melting point. The trifluoromethyl group also increases the hydrogen bond acceptors, which can lower the melting point. However, the presence of the amide group increases the hydrogen bond donors, which can raise the melting point. The net effect of these modifications is an increase in the melting point.",
