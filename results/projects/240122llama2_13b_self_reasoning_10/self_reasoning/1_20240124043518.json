    "Reason": "cis-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups that can affect its melting point. The basic unit for this compound is cyclohexene, which has a melting point of 16.5\u00b0C. The presence of two carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C each. The anhydride group (-O-C(=O)-O-) can also increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The cyclohexene ring can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and planarity, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
