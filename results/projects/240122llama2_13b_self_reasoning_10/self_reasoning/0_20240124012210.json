    "Reason": "2-naphthalenol is a polar molecule with a melting point of 65-68\u00b0C. The presence of a hydroxyl group increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The tetrahydro-substitution can also increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces.",
