    "Reason": "4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine contains a piperidine ring as its basic unit, which has a melting point of 106\u00b0C. The presence of a chloro substituent on the phenyl ring may increase the melting point due to the increased polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group may also contribute to the melting point by +5\u00b0C due to the potential for hydrogen bonding. The carbonyl group may contribute an additional +5\u00b0C due to the potential for dipole-dipole interactions. Summing up these changes: Piperidine base (+106\u00b0C), chloro substituent (+5\u00b0C), hydroxyl group (+5\u00b0C), and carbonyl group (+5\u00b0C).",
