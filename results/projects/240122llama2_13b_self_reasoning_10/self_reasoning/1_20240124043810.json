    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde contains functional groups that can affect its melting point. The basic unit of analysis is benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 20\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups increases the melting point by +10\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The iodine atom also increases the melting point by +10\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for intermolecular interactions. The carbonyl group (C=O) can increase the melting point by +5\u00b0C due to the potential for hydrogen bonding. The total increase in melting point is +35\u00b0C.",
