    "Reason": "The melting point of octadecane, 1-isocyanato- can be predicted by considering the effects of the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit of analysis is the octadecane chain, which has a melting point of around -20\u00b0C. The presence of an isocyanato group (-N=C=O) can increase the melting point due to the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increased molecular weight. The isocyanato group can contribute around +20 to +30\u00b0C. The melting point of the resulting compound would be around -20\u00b0C +20 to +30\u00b0C = 20 to 50\u00b0C.",
