    "Reason": "The molecule 3,5-dichlorophenylhydrazine consists of a phenyl ring with two chlorine substituents and a hydrazine group. The phenyl ring itself has a melting point of around 10\u00b0C due to its planarity and rigidity. The chlorine substituents increase the molecular weight and introduce dipole-dipole interactions, which can increase the melting point by about +40\u00b0C each. The hydrazine group can also contribute to the melting point due to its potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C.",
