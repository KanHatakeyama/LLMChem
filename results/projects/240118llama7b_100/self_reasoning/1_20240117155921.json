    "Reason": "The compound (2E)-2-phenyl-3-(phenylamino)prop-2-enenitrile can be broken down into the contributions of its functional groups to predict its melting point: \n- Basic unit, benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. \n- Phenyl group: adds significantly since it introduces a rigid and planar structure, which increases the melting point due to increased intermolecular forces. An educated estimate for this effect is +50\u00b0C to +70\u00b0C. \n- Nitrile group (-CN): adds to the melting point due to its electronegativity and the polarizability of the nitrogen atom, which increases intermolecular forces. An estimated effect could be around +10\u00b0C to +15\u00b0C due to the polar nature of the C-N bond. \n- Phenylamino group: adds to the melting point due to its electronegativity and the polarizability of the nitrogen atom, which increases intermolecular forces. An estimated effect could be around +10\u00b0C to +15\u00b0C due to the polar nature of the C-N bond. \n- Trans isomer: tends to have a higher melting point compared to the cis isomer due to better packing in the solid state. The effect can be estimated at around +5\u00b0C. \nConsidering these adjustments, the values are summation of the estimated effects.",
