    "Reason": "The molecule succinylsulfathiazole is composed of a sulfur-containing heterocycle and a succinimide group. The sulfur atom in the heterocycle can increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces and the presence of a polar sulfur atom. The succinimide group can also contribute to the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can increase the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces and the presence of a polar carbonyl group. Additionally, the larger molecule size and weight of the succinylsulfathiazole compared to the base molecule can also contribute to an increase in the melting point.",
