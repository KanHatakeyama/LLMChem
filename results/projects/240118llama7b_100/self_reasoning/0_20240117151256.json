    "Reason": "The base structure for the target compound is benzene, which has a melting point of approximately 5.5\u00b0C. The addition of a bromine atom increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, estimated at +100\u00b0C. The hydrazine group contributes to a rise in melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, adding approximately +40\u00b0C. The bromo group, while less impactful than the hydrazine group, increases the melting point due to its polar nature and potential for additional, albeit weaker, hydrogen bonding, contributing around +20\u00b0C. However, the actual value indicates a higher melting point than the calculated prediction, suggesting the influence of the hydrazine or bromo groups may be more significant than initially estimated, possibly due to enhanced resonance stabilization or stronger intermolecular forces than accounted for.",
