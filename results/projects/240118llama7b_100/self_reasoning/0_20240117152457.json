    "Reason": "The compound succinylsulfathiazole is composed of several functional groups that influence its melting point. The sulfur atom in the sulfathiazole ring is known to increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +40\u00b0C. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the base unit also contributes to increased rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding, adding another +20\u00b0C. The succinyl group, which is a carboxylic acid ester, generally increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, adding approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of a benzene ring in the base unit also contributes to increased melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity, adding another +50\u00b0C. Finally, the presence of a double bond in the base unit, which can contribute to increased melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, adds another +20\u00b0C. Combining these factors gives us the predicted melting point of the compound.",
