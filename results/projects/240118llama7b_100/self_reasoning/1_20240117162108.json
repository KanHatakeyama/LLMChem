    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is the melting point of the parent compound, which is 105.5 degrees Celsius. The acetyl group is a small functional group that adds a carbonyl group to the molecule, which can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential dipole-dipole interactions. The carbonyl group itself contributes to a +20 degree Celsius increase in melting point. The isatin unit, on the other hand, is a heterocyclic ring with a nitrogen atom, which can contribute to a +30 degree Celsius increase in melting point due to the increased molecular weight and potential hydrogen bonding. The acetyl group can also potentially contribute to hydrogen bonding with protic solvents, which could further increase the melting point. However, the isatin unit also introduces some flexibility to the molecule due to the ring structure, which could reduce the impact of the acetyl group. Therefore, a conservative estimate for the acetyl group would be +20 degrees Celsius, and for the isatin unit, +25 degrees Celsius.",
