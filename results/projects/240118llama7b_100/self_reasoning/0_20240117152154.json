    "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by several structural factors, including molecular weight, symmetry, and the strength of intermolecular forces. For 6-chloro-2-fluoropurine, we must consider the effects of the chlorine and fluorine atoms on the melting point. Chlorine is a heavy atom that increases the melting point due to stronger London dispersion forces, with an estimated +40 \u00b0C contribution per chlorine atom. Fluorine is a much heavier atom than chlorine, with a much greater electronegativity, which can significantly increase the melting point due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions. An estimated +60 \u00b0C contribution per fluorine atom might be a reasonable assumption. The purine base unit has a melting point of 105.5 \u00b0C, which we will use as the base for our prediction.",
