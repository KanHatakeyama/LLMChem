    "Reason": "The basic unit, xanthene, has a melting point of around 180\u00b0C. The carboxamide group is known to increase the melting point due to the presence of a carbonyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the molecular weight. The carboxamide group can contribute about +40\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen atom can also contribute to the melting point due to its electronegativity and potential for hydrogen bonding.",
