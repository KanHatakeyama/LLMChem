    "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by several structural factors, including molecular weight, symmetry, and the strength of intermolecular forces. For the compound benzaldehyde azine, several functional group effects should be considered: \n- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. \n- Aldehyde group: The aldehyde group can increase the melting point due to its polarity and the potential for hydrogen bonding. An estimated effect could be around +20 \u00b0C over benzene. \n- Azide group: The azide group is a strong base and can increase the melting point due to its high electronegativity and the potential for strong intermolecular forces. An estimated effect could be around +20 \u00b0C over benzene. \n- Double bonds: The presence of double bonds in the molecule can increase the melting point due to the increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. An estimated effect could be around +10 \u00b0C over benzene. \nConsidering these adjustments, the values are summation of the estimated effects.",
