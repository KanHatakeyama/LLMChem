    "Reason": "The molecule 2-cyclohexylbenzoic acid consists of a benzene ring with a cyclohexyl group attached. The cyclohexyl group adds rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, estimated to increase melting point by +40 over a basic hydrocarbon backbone. The benzene ring itself has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C.",
