    "Reason": "Leflunomide is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, each of which can affect its melting point. The basic unit for leflunomide is the pyrimidine ring, which has a melting point range of 120-130 degrees Celsius. The melting point of the pyrimidine ring is influenced by the presence of the methyl group (-CH3), which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the introduction of a flexible chain. The presence of the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) can also contribute to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the introduction of a flexible chain. The presence of the fluorine groups (-F) can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the introduction of a polar group. The presence of the amide group (-NHCO) can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the introduction of a polar group. The presence of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the introduction of a polar group. The presence of the sulfur atom can also increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the introduction of a polar group.",
