    "Reason": "The base compound for consideration is hexamethylene diamine, which has a melting point of -10.6\u00b0C. The dicyclohexylamine molecule has two additional alkyl groups compared to hexamethylene diamine, which increases the molecular weight and potentially enhances van der Waals interactions. However, the additional alkyl groups also increase the steric hindrance, which can reduce the melting point due to the decreased ability to form hydrogen bonds. The effect of the additional alkyl groups is difficult to estimate, but a rough estimate could be around -5\u00b0C per additional alkyl group.",
