    "Reason": "The compound has a melting point of 60 degrees Celsius. The basic unit, cyclobutane, has a melting point of -90 degrees Celsius. The two ester groups contribute approximately +60 degrees Celsius each, which is the same effect as the previous compound. The two oxygen atoms in the dioxaspiro ring system contribute to an increase in the melting point because they add ring strain and polar characteristics, estimated at +15 degrees Celsius for each oxygen atom. The geminal methyl groups on the cyclobutane ring provide a steric hindrance but may also increase the van der Waals forces slightly, which is estimated to be neutral.",
