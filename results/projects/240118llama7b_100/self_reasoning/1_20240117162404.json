    "Reason": "The compound 2'-deoxyuridine is composed of several functional groups that influence its melting point. The base unit, uridine, has a melting point of approximately -10\u00b0C. The deoxy group, which replaces the hydroxyl group in ribose, is known to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and decreased molecular movement. This can be estimated to raise the melting point by about +20\u00b0C. Additionally, the presence of the carbonyl group in the deoxyuridine base can contribute to increased melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions. The carbonyl group can be estimated to contribute about +30\u00b0C. The presence of the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the molecule can also contribute to increased melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding. These factors combined give us the predicted melting point of the compound.",
