    "Reason": "The compound in question has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius.\nThe phthalimide functional group is a polar and electron-withdrawing group, which typically raises the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding and resonance stability. An estimated contribution to the melting point could be around +80 degrees.\nThe methyl group attached to the phthalimide ring also increases the molecular weight and polarity, which could contribute to a higher melting point. An estimated contribution might be around +20 degrees.\nThe remaining carbon chain is a saturated hydrocarbon, which has a relatively low polarity and does not significantly impact the melting point.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate for the melting point of N-methylphthalimide would be around 120 degrees Celsius (for the phthalimide group) + 20 degrees (for the methyl group) = 140 degrees Celsius.",
