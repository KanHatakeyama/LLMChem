    "Reason": "The compound 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole has a melting point of approximately -40\u00b0C. The base structure of 1,3,4-oxadiazole has a melting point of -40\u00b0C. The methoxy group adds steric bulk and increases molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +20\u00b0C for the methoxy group. The phenyl group attached to the oxadiazine ring raises the melting point due to its pi-pi stacking interactions and increased molecular complexity. Estimate an increase of approximately +60\u00b0C. The oxadiazine ring itself has a moderate effect on melting point due to its planarity and increased molecular weight. We can estimate an increase of approximately +30\u00b0C. The total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -40 (base) + 20 (methoxy group) + 60 (phenyl group) + 30 (oxadiazine ring) = 110\u00b0C.",
