    "Reason": "The base molecule, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, has a melting point of -12.5 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom, as a heavy atom, increases the molecular weight and raises the melting point due to increased London dispersion forces. The bromine atom also adds polarity to the molecule, which can further contribute to the melting point. The effect of the bromine atom on the melting point is estimated to be around +50 degrees Celsius.",
