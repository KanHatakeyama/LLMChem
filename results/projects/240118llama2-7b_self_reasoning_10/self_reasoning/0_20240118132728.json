    "Reason": "Xanthotoxol is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups that contribute to its high melting point. The benzene ring has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, while the methyl group attached to the benzene ring increases the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group, which is known to raise the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased polarity, contributes approximately +50\u00b0C. The phenolic hydroxyl group also raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and resonance stability, contributing approximately +80\u00b0C. The presence of multiple polar functional groups in close proximity to each other can lead to synergistic effects, further increasing the melting point. Therefore, we estimate the melting point of xanthotoxol to be approximately 240\u00b0C.",
