    "Reason": "The base compound benzene has a melting point of around -18 degrees Celsius. Introducing two ethyl groups increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which raises the melting point. The pi-pi stacking interactions between the two ethyl groups and the benzene ring also contribute to the increase in melting point. The effect of each ethyl group is estimated to be around +20\u00b0C, resulting in a total increase of +40\u00b0C for both ethyl groups.",
