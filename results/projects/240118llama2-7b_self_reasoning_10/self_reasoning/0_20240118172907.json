    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 3-chlorophenylacetonitrile, we consider the known melting point influence of various functional groups relative to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom in the phenyl group increases the molecular weight and electronegativity, contributing to a higher melting point. The acetonitrile group is a polar functional group that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also contribute to a higher melting point. We estimate the effect of these functional groups as follows: Benzene (5.5) + Phenyl group (5) + Acetonitrile (5) = 5.5 + 5 + 5 = 15.5\u00b0C",
