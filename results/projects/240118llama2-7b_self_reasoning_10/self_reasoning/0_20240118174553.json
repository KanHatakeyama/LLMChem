    "Reason": "- Aromatic ring: The presence of an aromatic ring in the molecule contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point. Estimated contribution is +40\u00b0C.\n- Methyl groups: Methyl groups increase the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which can contribute to a higher melting point. Estimated contribution is +20\u00b0C per methyl group.\n- Carbonyl group: Carbonyl groups are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point. Estimated contribution is +30\u00b0C.\n- Hydroxyl group: Hydroxyl groups can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. Estimated contribution is +5\u00b0C per hydroxyl group.\n- Stereochemistry: The presence of chiral centers in the molecule can contribute to the density of the molecule, leading to a higher melting point. Estimated contribution is +10\u00b0C.\n\nBased on these considerations, the total estimated impact on the melting point of the molecule is: -40 (base) + 40 (aromatic ring) + 20 (methyl groups) + 30 (carbonyl group) + 5 (hydroxyl groups) + 10 (stereochemistry) = 115\u00b0C.",
