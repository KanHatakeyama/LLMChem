    "Reason": "The presence of a hydroxyl group in the molecule increases the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding capability. The presence of a pentyl side chain adds rotational freedom and flexibility, potentially reducing the melting point by 20-40\u00b0C. The overall effect of these features on the melting point is estimated to be a net increase of 30-50\u00b0C.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
