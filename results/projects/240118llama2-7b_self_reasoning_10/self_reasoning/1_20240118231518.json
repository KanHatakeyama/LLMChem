    "Reason": "- The base unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- The carboxylic acid group contributes to a raise in melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased polarity, with an estimated contribution of +50 degrees.\n- The methyl group attached to the benzene ring increases the molecular weight, leading to a higher melting point, estimated to contribute +10 degrees.\n- The presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.",
