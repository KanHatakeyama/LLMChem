    "Reason": "The molecule, m-phenoxybenzoic acid, has a phenoxy group attached to a benzene ring, which is a common functional group in organic chemistry. The phenoxy group is a polar and electronegative group, which can increase the melting point of the molecule due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. The benzene ring itself also contributes to the molecular weight and planarity, which can also increase the melting point. Starting with a base value of 100 degrees Celsius for benzene, we can estimate an increase of approximately 20 degrees Celsius due to the phenoxy group.",
