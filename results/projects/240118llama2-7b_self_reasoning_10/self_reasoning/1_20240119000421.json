    "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by various factors such as the molecular weight, symmetry, intermolecular forces, and polarity. In this case, the compound is a heterocyclic aromatic ring with a nitro group, which can significantly increase the melting point due to its strong electronegative nature and the capability for intermolecular interactions. The presence of two methyl groups adds to the molecular weight and steric bulk, which can increase the melting point. The benzene ring contributes to the melting point due to its aromaticity and conjugation, which can stabilize the molecule. The nitro group can participate in hydrogen bonding and form additional intermolecular interactions, which can further increase the melting point. The methyl groups can also contribute to van der Waals interactions, adding to the molecular weight and steric bulk. Therefore, we estimate the melting point of 4-dimethylaminobenzonitrile as follows: Benzene (5.5) + Methyl groups (2 * 5) + Nitro group (30) + Conjugation (5) = 5.5 + 10 + 30 + 5 = 50.5\u00b0C",
