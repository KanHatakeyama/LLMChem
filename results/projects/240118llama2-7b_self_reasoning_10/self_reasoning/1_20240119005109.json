    "Reason": "The compound indole-5-carbonitrile has a base melting point of 105.5\u00b0C, which is influenced by the following factors:\n- Indole ring: The indole ring itself has a melting point of approximately 100\u00b0C.\n- Carbonitrile group: The presence of a carbonitrile group typically lowers the melting point due to the increased polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities. An estimated contribution of -20 to -40\u00b0C is reasonable.\n- Nitrogen atom: Nitrogen-containing compounds generally have higher melting points due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution of +10 to +20\u00b0C is reasonable.\n- Cumulative impact: The individual contributions of each group can be summed up, but it's also necessary to consider that the presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 100 (for the indole ring) - 40 (for the carbonitrile group) + 20 (for the nitrogen atom) = 70.5 degrees Celsius. Adding a consideration for synergistic effects, a more refined estimate taking into account the cumulative polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups might be approximated as +20 degrees, leading to a predicted melting point of 90.5 degrees Celsius.",
