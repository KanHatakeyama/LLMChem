    "Reason": "The compound diphenyl phosphoramidate has a structure composed of a phenyl group attached to a phosphoramidate group. The phenyl group is known to increase the melting point due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings, which can participate in \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and increase intermolecular interactions. The phosphoramidate group, on the other hand, is a polar functional group that can also contribute to the melting point through hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The estimated increase in melting point due to the phenyl group is around 30-40 degrees Celsius, while the phosphoramidate group might contribute an additional 10-20 degrees Celsius.",
