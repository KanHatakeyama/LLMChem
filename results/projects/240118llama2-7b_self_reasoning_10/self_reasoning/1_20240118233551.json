    "Reason": "The compound benzaldehyde azine has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, which is the base value for a simple hydrocarbon backbone. The presence of the aldehyde group can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. The azide group can also contribute to an increase in melting point due to its strong electronegativity and potential for intermolecular interactions, estimated at +30\u00b0C. The presence of multiple aromatic rings can also contribute to a higher melting point due to increased rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C. Finally, the presence of a conjugated double bond can also contribute to an increase in melting point due to increased rigidity and potential for intermolecular interactions, estimated at +10\u00b0C.",
