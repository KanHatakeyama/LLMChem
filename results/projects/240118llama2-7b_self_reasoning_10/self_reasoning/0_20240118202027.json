    "Reason": "The iodine atom in the molecule introduces a high degree of polarity due to the electronegativity of iodine, which can increase the intermolecular forces between molecules, potentially leading to a higher melting point. Additionally, the phenol group can also contribute to a higher melting point due to its hydrogen bonding capabilities.",
