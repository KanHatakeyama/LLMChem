    "Reason": "- Trifluoromethyl group: Electronegative and polar, disrupts the crystal lattice and intermolecular interactions, leading to a lower melting point. Estimated to decrease the melting point by -10 degrees Celsius.\n- Benzoyl group: Aromatic ring and ester functionalities contribute to rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which may increase the melting point. Estimated to increase the melting point by +10 degrees Celsius.",
