    "Reason": "The compound 1-methylbenzo[3,4]cyclobuta[1,2-b]quinoxaline has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The methyl group adds bulkiness and steric hindrance, which increases the melting point. The quinoxaline ring system has a melting point of around 120 degrees Celsius, and the cyclobutyl ring adds further rigidity and planarity, which contributes to a higher melting point. The presence of the benzene ring also contributes to a higher melting point due to its planarity and rigidity. The overall effect of the methyl group is an estimated increase of +20 degrees Celsius, while the quinoxaline and cyclobutyl rings contribute an estimated +40 degrees Celsius and +60 degrees Celsius, respectively. The predicted increase over the base value of phenol would be +20\u00b0C (methyl group) + 40\u00b0C (quinoxaline ring) + 60\u00b0C (cyclobutyl ring) + 120\u00b0C (benzene ring), amounting to a +140\u00b0C increase.",
