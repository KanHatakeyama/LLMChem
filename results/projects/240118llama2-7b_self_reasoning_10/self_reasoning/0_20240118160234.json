    "Reason": "The target compound, 2-[(4-amino-2-nitrophenyl)amino]ethanol, has a basic melting point of around 120 degrees Celsius due to its hydrophobic nature and the presence of a nitro group, which can increase the melting point. However, the amino group can also contribute to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and steric hindrance. The 4-amino group can also contribute to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and steric hindrance. The presence of a nitro group can also increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds.",
