    "Reason": "The compound 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) has a base structure of aniline, which has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms on adjacent carbon atoms increases the molecular weight and polarity, leading to a higher melting point. The chlorine atoms also participate in London dispersion forces, which further contribute to the melting point. The estimated increase in melting point due to the chlorine atoms is around +100 degrees Celsius.",
