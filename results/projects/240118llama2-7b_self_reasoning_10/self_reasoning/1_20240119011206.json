    "Reason": "The base compound quinoline has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The methyl group attached to the quinoline ring increases the molecular weight and adds a hydrophobic effect, which can contribute to a higher melting point. The methyl group also increases the steric hindrance around the ring, which can make it more difficult for the molecule to pack together and increase the melting point. The effect of the methyl group is estimated to be around +20 degrees Celsius.",
