    "Reason": "- The presence of the Boc group (Boc=tert-Butyl) adds bulkiness and steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point. Estimated to add +20\u00b0C to the melting point.\n- The hydroxyl group adds hydrogen bonding capabilities, which can increase the melting point by +5\u00b0C.\n- The silicon atom adds a rigid structure, which can increase the melting point by +10\u00b0C.\n- The pyrrole ring is planar and aromatic, which can increase the melting point by +10\u00b0C.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
