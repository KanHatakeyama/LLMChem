    "Reason": "The compound has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The pyrrole ring has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The fluorine atoms on the phenyl groups increase the melting point due to their high electronegativity and increased London dispersion forces. The vinyl group on the pyrrole ring also contributes to an increase in melting point due to its rigidity and the pi-pi interactions between the vinyl and pyrrole rings. The dimethylamino group on the pyrrole ring can also contribute to an increase in melting point due to its electron-withdrawing nature. The overall effect of these functional groups is an estimated increase in melting point of 100 (pyrrole ring) + 20 (fluorine atoms) + 40 (vinyl group) + 10 (dimethylamino group) = 170 degrees Celsius.",
