    "Reason": "The nitro functional group (-NO2) typically raises the melting point of a molecule by around 30-40 degrees Celsius due to the increased polarity and electronegativity of the nitro group. Additionally, the aromatic ring system of anthracene also contributes to its high melting point, with a typical value of around 120-130 degrees Celsius. The presence of the nitro group can further increase the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and electron-withdrawing ability of the nitro group.",
