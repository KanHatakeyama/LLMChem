    "Reason": "- Macrocyclic ring structure: Adds rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Estimated to increase melting point by +30 over a basic hydrocarbon backbone.\n- Hydroxyl group: One hydroxyl group capable of hydrogen bonding. Estimated to increase melting point by +5.\n- Stereochemistry: The molecule's single chiral center allows for denser packing, likely to increase the melting point. Estimated increase of +5.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
