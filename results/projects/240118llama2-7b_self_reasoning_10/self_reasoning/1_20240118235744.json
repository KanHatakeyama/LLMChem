    "Reason": "The base unit of carbonic acid, a simple hydrocarbon, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The diphenyl ester functional group adds significant bulk and polarity to the molecule, which can increase the melting point. The presence of two phenyl groups adds to the molecular weight and provides some symmetry, which can positively influence the melting point. Each phenyl group can contribute to an increase in melting point due to its bulkiness and polarity, estimated at +20 to +30\u00b0C. The diphenyl ester group can also contribute to an increase in melting point due to its polarity and potential for pi-pi stacking, estimated at +30 to +40\u00b0C. The collective effect of the phenyl groups and the ester group must be considered synergistically, rather than additively, due to the complex interplay of implied intermolecular interactions.",
