    "Reason": "The nitro functional group (NO2) is known to increase the melting point of a molecule due to its electronegativity and polarity. The nitro group can contribute an estimated +50\u00b0C to the melting point. The indazole ring itself has a melting point of around 120\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than the typical melting point of aromatic rings due to its planarity and rigidity. The presence of a nitro group in the ring can further increase the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. Assuming an additive effect, the contribution of the nitro group can be estimated to be around +20\u00b0C. The total increase in melting point due to the indazole ring would be approximately 140\u00b0C.",
