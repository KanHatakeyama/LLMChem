    "Reason": "Secobarbital has a melting point of 120-125\u00b0C. The molecular structure of secobarbital consists of a phenyl ring, a benzene ring, and a methyl group. The phenyl ring and the methyl group are rigid and planar, which can contribute to the high melting point. The benzene ring has a lower melting point than the phenyl ring due to its smaller size and more flexible structure. The presence of the methyl group can also contribute to the high melting point by increasing the molecular weight and steric hindrance.\n\nBased on the structural features of secobarbital, we can estimate the contribution of each functional group to the melting point. The phenyl ring contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. The benzene ring has a lower melting point than the phenyl ring due to its smaller size and more flexible structure, which can contribute to a decrease of approximately -20\u00b0C. The methyl group increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which can contribute to a raise in melting point of approximately +20\u00b0C.\n\nSumming these contributions, the predicted increase over the base value of phenol would be +40\u00b0C (phenyl ring) + -20\u00b0C (benzene ring) + +20\u00b0C (methyl group), amounting to a +60\u00b0C increase.",
