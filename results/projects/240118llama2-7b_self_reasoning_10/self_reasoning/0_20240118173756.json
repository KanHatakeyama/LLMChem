    "Reason": "Opipramol is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups. The base structure consists of a benzene ring with a methyl group attached, a phenyl group attached through a methylene linkage, and a hydroxyl group. The methyl group and phenyl group contribute to the melting point, while the hydroxyl group reduces it due to its polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities. The estimation for the methyl group is around +20 degrees Celsius, while the phenyl group might contribute +40 to +60 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyl group reduces the melting point by -10 to -20 degrees Celsius.",
