    "Reason": "The molecule has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. The nitro functional group (-NO2) is electron-withdrawing and increases the molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point. The CF3 substituents are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which also increases the melting point. The pyridine ring is a planar, aromatic system with a high degree of conjugation, which can contribute to a higher melting point. The total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -10 (base) + 20 (nitro group) + 30 (CF3 groups) + 40 (pyridine ring) = 80 degrees Celsius.",
