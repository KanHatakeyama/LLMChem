    "Reason": "Benzaldehyde, 3,4-dimethoxy- has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C. The methoxy groups increase the molecular weight and contribute to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which raises the melting point. The presence of a benzene ring also contributes to the rigidity and aromaticity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point. The estimated increase in melting point due to the methoxy groups is around +30\u00b0C, and the benzene ring contributes an additional +20\u00b0C, for a total estimated increase of +50\u00b0C.",
