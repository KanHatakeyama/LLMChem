    "Reason": "The compound 5,6-dihydro-5-methyluracil has a melting point of 251\u00b0C, which is significantly higher than that of the parent compound, uracil (melting point of 170\u00b0C). The main structural features contributing to this high melting point are the methyl and hydroxyl groups. The methyl group adds bulkiness and steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20 to +40\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group, due to its polarity and ability to participate in hydrogen bonding, can contribute to an increase in melting point by approximately +50 to +80\u00b0C. The presence of the carbonyl group also contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can further increase the melting point by approximately +20 to +40\u00b0C. The overall effect of these structural features is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +120 to +160\u00b0C.",
