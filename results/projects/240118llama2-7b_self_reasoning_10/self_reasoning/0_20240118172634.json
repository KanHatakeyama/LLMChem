    "Reason": "The compound p-hydroxy propyl benzoate has a benzene ring attached to a propyl group through an oxygen atom. The benzene ring has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius, while the propyl group has a melting point of 42 degrees Celsius. The oxygen atom acts as a polarizing agent, increasing the electronegativity of the molecule and contributing to the overall polarity. The hydroxyl group also contributes to the polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities of the molecule. The presence of multiple polar functional groups in close proximity can lead to increased intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point.",
