    "Reason": "Octylamine has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C, which is significantly lower than the melting points of other amines due to the presence of a long hydrocarbon chain. The hydrocarbon chain contributes to the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point. However, the effect of the hydrocarbon chain on the melting point is limited when compared to more polar functional groups. Given the data for other amines, the effect of the hydrocarbon chain might roughly be estimated between +10 to +20 degrees Celsius.",
