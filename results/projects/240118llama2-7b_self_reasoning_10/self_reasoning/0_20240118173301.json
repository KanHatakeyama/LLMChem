    "Reason": "The compound 6-phenylquinoline has a high melting point due to its molecular structure. The presence of a phenyl group as the base unit, with a typical melting point of around 100\u00b0C, is significantly altered by the addition of other functional groups and structural features. The aromatic ring structure tends to contribute to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can significantly increase the melting point, this effect might contribute an estimated +50\u00b0C. Each methyl group, due to its bulkiness, increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which would typically raise the melting point; assuming an additive effect, each methyl can contribute approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point. With three methyl groups present, the overall contribution from the methyl groups would be +60\u00b0C. Summing these contributions, the predicted increase over the base value of phenyl would be 50\u00b0C (aromatic ring) + 60\u00b0C (methyl groups), amounting to a +110\u00b0C increase.",
