    "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by various factors such as the molecular weight, symmetry, intermolecular forces, and polarity. Benzoic acid, with a base melting point of approximately -20\u00b0C, has a polar functional group, which contributes to the melting point due to its ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions. The presence of a hydroxyl group adds to the molecular weight and polarity, which can increase the melting point. The ester functional group can also contribute to the melting point due to its dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nUsing the base melting point of -20\u00b0C, we can estimate the increase in melting point due to the hydroxyl group as approximately +5\u00b0C. The ester group can contribute an additional +5\u00b0C. The presence of the benzene ring also contributes to the melting point, estimated at +20\u00b0C.\n\nTherefore, the total estimated increase in melting point for this compound is approximately +30\u00b0C.",
