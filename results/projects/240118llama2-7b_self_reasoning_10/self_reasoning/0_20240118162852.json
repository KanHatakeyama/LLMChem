    "Reason": "- Halogen atoms: The presence of three bromine atoms increases the intermolecular interactions, which can lead to a higher melting point. Estimated increase of +50 to +70\u00b0C.\n- Conjugated double bond: The presence of a conjugated double bond within the molecule can contribute to increased rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, estimated to increase melting point by +20 to +40\u00b0C.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
