    "Reason": "The compound 6-chloro-2-fluoropurine has a high melting point due to its molecular structure. The presence of a fluorine atom, which is known to increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and polarity, contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule. The chlorine atom also increases the melting point due to its electronegativity and the polarity it introduces. The purine base unit has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C, which is significantly altered by the addition of other functional groups and structural features. The overall effect of the fluorine and chlorine atoms is more significant in this case. Estimating the influence of each atom to be a +20 degrees Celsius increase, we get a combined shift of +40 degrees Celsius.",
