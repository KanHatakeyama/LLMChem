    "Reason": "The base molecule lepidine has a melting point of -12.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a methyl group on the aromatic ring increases the molecular weight and introduces a polar functional group, which can contribute to the melting point. Additionally, the methyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also contribute to the melting point. The effect of the methyl group on the melting point is estimated to be around +20 degrees Celsius.",
