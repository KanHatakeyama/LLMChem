    "Reason": "The base molecule, 3H-indol-3-one, has a melting point of -12.5 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring adds a melting point contribution of around +50 degrees Celsius due to its planarity and increased molecular weight. The phenyl group attached to the pyridine ring adds another +60 degrees Celsius due to its increased polarity and conjugation. The iodine substituent on the phenyl group adds +50 degrees Celsius due to its electron-withdrawing nature and increased molecular weight. The total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -12.5 (base) + 50 (pyridine ring) + 60 (phenyl group) + 50 (iodine) = 162.5 degrees Celsius.",
