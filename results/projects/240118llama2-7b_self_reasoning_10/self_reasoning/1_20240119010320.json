    "Reason": "The nitro functional group in anthracene, 9-nitro- adds a significant increase in melting point due to its electronegative nature and the ability to participate in hydrogen bonding. The nitro group can contribute approximately +30 degrees Celsius to the melting point. Additionally, the aromatic ring system in anthracene contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and the potential for \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. The presence of nine nitrogen atoms in the molecule can also contribute to the melting point due to their increased molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding.",
