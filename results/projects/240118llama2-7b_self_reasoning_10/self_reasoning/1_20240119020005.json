    "Reason": "The compound 4-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzonitrile has a high melting point due to its molecular structure. The presence of nitro functional groups, which are known to increase the melting point due to their electronegative nature and the capability for intermolecular interactions, contributes to an estimated +30\u00b0C. The chlorine atom also participates in intermolecular interactions, contributing +5\u00b0C. The benzene ring structure provides rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, estimated at +40\u00b0C. The dinitro group adds further electronegativity and intermolecular interactions, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group can significantly increase the melting point because of its strong electronegative nature and the capability for intermolecular interactions, contributing approximately +30\u00b0C.
