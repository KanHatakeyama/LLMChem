    "Reason": "The compound gamabufotalin has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that influence its melting point. The base unit, a benzene ring, has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid group typically raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased polarity, with an estimated contribution of +50 degrees. The amide group also raises the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability, with an estimated contribution of +80 degrees. The alkene group has a less significant impact on melting points compared to the benzene ring or amide group, but could increase the melting point due to rigidity in the structure, with an estimated contribution of +10 degrees. The methyl group attached to the benzene ring also increases the molecular weight leading to higher melting points, with an estimated contribution of +5 degrees. The presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.",
