    "Reason": "The compound propiophenone, 3,3-diphenyl- has a high melting point due to its molecular structure. The presence of two phenyl groups as the base unit, with a typical melting point of around 41\u00b0C, is significantly altered by the addition of other functional groups and structural features. The aromatic ring system contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can significantly increase the melting point, this effect might contribute an estimated +50\u00b0C. Each phenyl group, due to its bulkiness, increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which would typically raise the melting point; assuming an additive effect, each phenyl can contribute approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point. With two phenyl groups present, the overall contribution from the phenyl groups would be +40\u00b0C. Summing these contributions, the predicted increase over the base value of phenol would be +50\u00b0C (aromatic ring system) + 40\u00b0C (phenyl groups), amounting to a +90\u00b0C increase.",
