    "Reason": "- Phosphorus atom: Adds rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Estimated to increase melting point by +30 over a basic hydrocarbon backbone.\n- Methyl groups: Three methyl groups capable of hydrogen bonding. Estimated to increase melting point by +5 per methyl group for a total of +15.\n- Aromatic ring: Provides additional rigidity, estimated to increase melting point by +10.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
