    "Reason": "The compound's structural features, including the aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, and methyl groups, influence its melting point:\n\n- Aromatic ring: The aromatic ring has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C.\n- Carboxylic acid group: The carboxylic acid group typically raises the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased polarity. An estimated contribution could be +50 degrees.\n- Methyl groups: Methyl groups increase the molecular weight leading to higher melting points, although the contribution is typically small. Estimated contribution might be +5 degrees.\n\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 100 (for the aromatic ring) + 50 (for the carboxylic acid) + 5 (for the methyl group) = 155 degrees Celsius.",
