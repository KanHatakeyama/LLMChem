    "Reason": "The basic unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom adds a significant increase in melting point due to its electronegativity and the resulting polarity. A rough estimate for the bromine's contribution could be +50 degrees. The methyl groups, which are attached to the benzene ring, increase the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which can lead to a higher melting point. An estimated contribution might be +20 degrees.",
