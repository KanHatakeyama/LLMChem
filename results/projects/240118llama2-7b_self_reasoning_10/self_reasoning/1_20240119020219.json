    "Reason": "The melting point of d-altrose can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule and their influence on the melting point.\nThe base unit of d-altrose is a benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a carboxylic acid group increases the melting point by approximately +50 degrees. The presence of a hydroxyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +70 degrees. The presence of a methyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees.\nThe overall contribution of these functional groups to the melting point of d-altrose can be estimated as follows: 5.5 (for the benzene ring) + 50 (for the carboxylic acid) + 70 (for the hydroxyl group) + 10 (for the methyl group) = 130 degrees Celsius.",
