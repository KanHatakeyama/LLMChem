    "Reason": "The presence of the azodicarbonyl group (C(=O)N=C) in the molecule increases the melting point due to the polar nature of the nitrogen lone pair and the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitrogen. The dipiperidine ring also contributes to the melting point due to its aromaticity and the presence of multiple conjugated double bonds. The molecule's stereochemistry and the presence of a tertiary amine also contribute to its melting point.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
