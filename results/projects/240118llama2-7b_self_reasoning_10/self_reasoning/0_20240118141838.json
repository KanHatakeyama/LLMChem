    "Reason": "The compound d-altrose has a structure composed of a hexose (six-carbon) ring with an oxygen atom at one end and a hydroxyl (-OH) group at the other. The hydroxyl group is a strong electronegative atom that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases the intermolecular interactions and raises the melting point. Additionally, the hexose ring itself has a planar structure that can contribute to the molecular weight and increase the melting point. Starting with a base value of 100 degrees Celsius for a simple hexose (e.g., glucose), the addition of the hydroxyl group might increase the melting point by approximately 20 degrees Celsius due to the increased electronegativity and hydrogen bonding potential.",
