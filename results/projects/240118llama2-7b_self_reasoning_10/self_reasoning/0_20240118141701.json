    "Reason": "The molecule, 4-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzonitrile, has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that contribute to its melting point. We will analyze each group's effect on the melting point:\n- Chlorine: Chlorine is a polar functional group that can form hydrogen bonds, which increases the melting point. Estimate an increase of approximately +20\u00b0C.\n- Nitrile group: Nitriles are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which also increases the melting point. Estimate an increase of approximately +30\u00b0C.\n- Dinitro group: Dinitro groups are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which also increases the melting point. Estimate an increase of approximately +40\u00b0C.\n- Benzene ring: The benzene ring is a planar, aromatic system that can engage in pi-pi interactions, which can increase the melting point. Estimate an increase of approximately +40\u00b0C.\n- Chlorine atom: Being a small linker, its influence is small. However, it adds rigidity to the molecule, so we can estimate a small increase of +5\u00b0C.",
