    "Reason": "The presence of a nitro functional group in the molecule increases the melting point due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group. The ethoxy group also contributes to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and steric hindrance. The aromatic ring in the molecule also contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point. The estimated increase in melting point due to the nitro group is around +50\u00b0C, while the ethoxy group contributes around +30\u00b0C. The aromatic ring contributes around +20\u00b0C. The total estimated increase in melting point is around +100\u00b0C.",
