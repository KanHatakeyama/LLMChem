    "Reason": "The nitro functional group contributes to the melting point due to its electron-withdrawing nature, which stabilizes the molecular charge distribution. The naphthalene ring also contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and aromaticity. The aldehyde group can also contribute to the melting point due to its polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.\n\nBased on the melting points of similar compounds, the nitro group can increase the melting point by around 50 degrees Celsius. The naphthalene ring can increase the melting point by around 100 degrees Celsius. The aldehyde group can increase the melting point by around 20 degrees Celsius.\n\nConsidering the synergistic effect of multiple functional groups, the total estimated increase in melting point can be around 100 degrees Celsius.",
