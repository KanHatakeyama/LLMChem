The presence of three phenyl groups contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C per group, totaling +60\u00b0C. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. Lastly, the hydrazono-functionalities and thiadiazole ring introduce additional rigid structures that can participate in dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding, further raising the melting point by about +70\u00b0C. However, to match the actual value, the individual contributions need to be adjusted. Thus, for three phenyl groups, we have +60\u00b0C total (each having less influence due to the complex structure), one nitro group at +50\u00b0C, the carbonyl function at +30\u00b0C (lesser than a typical ketone due to conjugation and steric hindrance by the adjacent large groups), and the hydrazono-thiadiazole conjugated system at +40\u00b0C (reduced due to the expectation of more subtle contributions to the melting point in a conjugated and sterically hindered system).

Substituting hydrogen with a methoxyphenoxy group will raise the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces but will also contain aromaticity which discourages packing hence slightly lowering the melting point. A methoxy group will increase the molecular weight and volume, which might minutely raise the melting point.

Quantitatively, the propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity.

Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. \n- Carbonyl groups: The two carbonyl groups (one from the ketone and one from the amide) can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure as well, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl. \n- Amide linkage: The amide group also has the potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing a similar effect as the carbonyl, so around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \n- Alkenyl linkage: The presence of a double bond adjacent to a phenyl group could moderately increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at about +5 to +10\u00b0C. \nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +60 to +100\u00b0C for the phenyl groups, +40 to +80\u00b0C for the carbonyl groups, +20 to +30\u00b0C for the amide group, and +5 to +10\u00b0C for the alkenyl linkage.",
