The thioether group is less polar than the thiol group, and thus, the intermolecular forces are weaker. The thioether group is also bulkier, which can disrupt the crystal lattice and further reduce the melting point. The amide group (-N-C=O) in penicillamine can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point.

Then, we account for the following functional group effects: \n- Phenyl groups: The three phenyl rings should significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. \n- Ether linkages: The two ether linkages (\u2013O\u2013) can form weak hydrogen bonds and increase molecular flexibility, which may slightly decrease the melting point.
