The pyrrole ring has a melting point around -65 degrees Celsius due to its planar structure and weak intermolecular forces. The phenylsulfonyl group has a melting point around 100 degrees Celsius due to the presence of a polar sulfonyl group (\u2013SO2) which can participate in hydrogen bonding and has a high molecular weight. The overall melting point of the compound should be significantly higher than the pyrrole ring due to the presence of the phenylsulfonyl group. The melting point increase can be estimated by considering the melting point difference between the pyrrole ring and the phenylsulfonyl group, which is around 165 degrees Celsius. However, the actual increase will be lower due to the steric hindrance between the pyrrole ring and the phenylsulfonyl group. The steric hindrance can be estimated to reduce the melting point increase by around 20%.\n##Prediction: 132.0\n\n\n#Problem",
