The basic unit of analysis is the 1,2-propanediol moiety, which on its own exhibits intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thus increasing the melting point. Substituting hydrogen with a methoxyphenoxy group will raise the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces but will also contain aromaticity which discourages packing hence slightly lowering the melting point. A methoxy group will increase the molecular weight and volume, which might minutely raise the melting point. However, the presence of an ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) has a slight lowering effect because it does not participate in hydrogen bonding as intensely as a hydroxyl group would. Finally, the carbamate group (1-carbam) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. Quantitatively, the propanediol base might be considered to have a melting point around 50 degrees Celsius, based on the fact that 1,2-propanediol itself has a melting point around that value. For the methoxyphenoxy group, let's say it increases it by +20 degrees Celsius due to the increased molecular weight mitigated by the aromaticity. The ether linkage might reduce it very slightly, say -2 degrees Celsius. The methoxy group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the carbamate group can lead to a significant increase, of about +20 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
