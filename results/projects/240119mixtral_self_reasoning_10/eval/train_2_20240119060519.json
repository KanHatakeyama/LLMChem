The basic unit of anthraquinone has a melting point of 286\u00b0C. The addition of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) can increase the melting point due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated to add around +20\u00b0C. The amino group (-NH2) can also increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, but it can also disrupt the packing of the molecules due to its polar nature, which can slightly lower the melting point. The net effect of the amino group can be estimated to be around +10\u00b0C. The overall melting point increase can be estimated as the sum of the effects of the carboxylic acid and amino groups.\n##Prediction: 316.0\n\n\n#Problem",

Then, we account for the following functional group effects: \n- Phenyl groups: The two phenyl rings should significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C. \n- Carbonyl groups: The two carbonyl groups (one from the ketone and one from the amide) can form strong hydrogen bonds and rigidify the structure as well, contributing around +20 to +40\u00b0C for each carbonyl. \n- Amide linkage: The amide group also has the potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing a similar effect as the carbonyl, so around +20 to +30\u00b0C. \n- Alkenyl linkage: The presence of a double bond adjacent to a phenyl group could moderately increase the melting point due to the restricted rotation and planarity it introduces; we can estimate this at about +5 to +10\u00b0C. \nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +60 to +100\u00b0C for the phenyl groups, +40 to +80\u00b0C for the carbonyl groups, +20 to +30\u00b0C for the amide group, and +5 to +10\u00b0C for the alkenyl linkage.",

The basic unit of benzaldehyde has a melting point of 9.5 \u00b0C. The methoxy groups (\u2013OCH3) increase the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the oxygen within the methoxy group also increases hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in benzaldehyde, the additional oxygen atom allows for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. The iodine atom (\u2013I) is a heavy halogen, which increases the molecular weight and size significantly, thus raising the melting point. The iodine atom is also a weak hydrogen bond acceptor, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methoxy groups and iodine atom into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point compared to benzaldehyde.\n##Prediction: 50.0\n\n\n#Problem",
