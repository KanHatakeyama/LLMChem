However, the presence of the amino groups also increases hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are already present in 1,2-ethanediamine, the additional amino groups allow for more hydrogen bond formation, which can further lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the aminoethyl groups into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point compared to 1,2-ethanediamine.",
