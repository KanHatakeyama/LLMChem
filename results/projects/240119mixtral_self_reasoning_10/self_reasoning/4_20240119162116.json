    "Reason": "4-acetanilide has a melting point of 82.0\u00b0C. The introduction of a chlorine atom at the 3' position and a fluorine atom at the 4' position will increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The presence of halogens in the aromatic ring increases the electron density, which can lead to stronger pi-pi interactions. The effect of a chlorine atom is estimated to add approximately 20\u00b0C to the melting point, while a fluorine atom is estimated to add approximately 10\u00b0C.",
