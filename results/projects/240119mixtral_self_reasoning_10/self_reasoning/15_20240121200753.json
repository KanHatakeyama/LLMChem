    "Reason": "1-aminoanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is anthraquinone, which has a melting point of 286 \u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) increases the melting point due to the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds. However, the melting point increase due to a single carboxylic acid group is estimated to be around 10-20 \u00b0C. The amino group (-NH2) can increase the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds, but the effect is generally smaller than that of a carboxylic acid group. The increase due to the amino group is estimated to be around 5-10 \u00b0C.",
