    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene is a derivative of toluene, which has a melting point of -95\u00b0C. The presence of two ethyl groups in the 1,3-positions increases the molecular weight and introduces more van der Waals interactions, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C per group, totaling +20\u00b0C. The methyl group in the 5-position also increases the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing an additional +5\u00b0C.",
