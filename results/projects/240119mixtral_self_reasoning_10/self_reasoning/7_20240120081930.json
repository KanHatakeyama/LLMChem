    "Reason": "1-aminoanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit is the anthraquinone moiety, which has a melting point of 286 \u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which can add approximately +20 \u00b0C. The amino group (-NH2) also increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which can add approximately +20 \u00b0C. However, the amino group can also disrupt the packing of the crystal lattice due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds in multiple directions, which can lower the melting point slightly. Overall, the melting point increase due to the amino group and carboxylic acid group should be approximately +30 \u00b0C.",
