    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane is a simple alkyl fluoride. The melting point of a compound is influenced by several factors, including molecular weight, molecular symmetry, and molecular shape. The melting point of a compound increases with molecular weight. The molecular weight of 1-fluoropentane is 86.10 g/mol, which is higher than the molecular weight of pentane (72.15 g/mol). The melting point of pentane is -129.7 \u00b0C. The presence of a fluorine atom in 1-fluoropentane increases the molecular weight by approximately 19 g/mol. The melting point of a compound also increases with molecular symmetry. The molecular symmetry of 1-fluoropentane is lower than that of pentane due to the presence of a fluorine atom. The melting point of a compound also increases with molecular shape. The molecular shape of 1-fluoropentane is more complex than that of pentane due to the presence of a fluorine atom. The melting point of 1-fluoropentane is estimated to be lower than that of pentane due to the lower molecular symmetry and more complex molecular shape.",
