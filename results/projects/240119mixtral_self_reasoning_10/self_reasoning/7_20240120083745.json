    "Reason": "2-Pyridineacetamide has a pyridine ring, which has a melting point of -41.6 degrees Celsius. The acetamide group has a melting point of 82 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring is a rigid structure, which increases the melting point due to pi-stacking interactions. The acetamide group has a carbonyl group and an amide group, which can form hydrogen bonds. The melting point increase due to the acetamide group is expected to be more significant than the melting point decrease due to the pyridine ring. The net effect is a higher melting point than the basic unit.",
