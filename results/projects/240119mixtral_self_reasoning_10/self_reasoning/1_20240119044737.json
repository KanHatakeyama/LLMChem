    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole is a derivative of anisole (methoxybenzene) with a melting point of 15.5\u00b0C. The presence of a chlorine atom in the para position increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to form stronger London dispersion forces. The chlorine atom can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point. Additionally, the methyl group in the ortho position increases the molecular volume and disrupts the crystal lattice, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -5\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Anisole base (+15.5\u00b0C), chlorine atom (+20\u00b0C), and ortho methyl group (-5\u00b0C).",
