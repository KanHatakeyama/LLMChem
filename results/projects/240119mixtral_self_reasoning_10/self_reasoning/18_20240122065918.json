    "Reason": "1,3-butadiene has a melting point of -108.9\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is cyclobutane, which has a melting point of -120.0\u00b0C. The methylene bridge introduces a double bond, which increases the rigidity and molecular weight, thus raising the melting point. The estimated increase due to the methylene bridge is approximately +10\u00b0C.",
