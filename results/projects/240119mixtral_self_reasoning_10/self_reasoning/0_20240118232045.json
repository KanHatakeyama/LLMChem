    "Reason": "3-hydroxy-4-iodobenzoic acid is an organic compound with three functional groups: a carboxylic acid, a phenol, and an iodine atom. The carboxylic acid group (\u2013COOH) is capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds, which significantly increases the melting point. The phenol group (\u2013OH) also contributes to the melting point increase due to hydrogen bonding. The iodine atom (I) is a heavy halogen, which increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, further raising the melting point. The combined effect of these functional groups on the melting point can be estimated as follows: Carboxylic acid: +50\u00b0C, Phenol: +20\u00b0C, Iodine: +10\u00b0C. The total estimated melting point increase is +80\u00b0C.",
