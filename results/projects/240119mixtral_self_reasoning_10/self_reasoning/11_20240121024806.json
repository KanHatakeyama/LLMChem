    "Reason": "2,5-dichlorothiophene has a basic unit of thiophene, which has a melting point of -38.5\u00b0C. The presence of two chlorine atoms in the 2,5-positions increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for dipole-dipole interactions. Each chlorine atom can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point.",
