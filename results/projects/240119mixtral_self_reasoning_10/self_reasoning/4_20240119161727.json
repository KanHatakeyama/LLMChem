    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane is a perfluorinated compound, which means that all hydrogen atoms in the ethane molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms. The presence of fluorine atoms in the molecule significantly increases the melting point compared to the parent compound, ethane (\u2212182.8 \u00b0C). The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the electronegativity of fluorine also increases the dipole moment and hydrogen bonding potential. Since hydrogen bonds are not present in ethane, the additional fluorine atoms allow for more dipole-dipole interactions, which can further raise the melting point. Taking the effect of the fluorine atoms into consideration, we can predict a significant increase in the melting point compared to ethane.",
