    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a pyrrole ring and a phenylsulfonyl group. The basic unit, pyrrole, has a melting point around -20\u00b0C. The phenylsulfonyl group has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a phenyl group and a sulfonyl group. The melting point increase due to the phenyl group is around +30\u00b0C, and the melting point increase due to the sulfonyl group is around +70\u00b0C. The presence of a pyrrole ring and a phenylsulfonyl group in the same molecule can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The increase due to the pyrrole ring is around +10\u00b0C, and the increase due to the phenylsulfonyl group is around +10\u00b0C. The total increase in the melting point is around +120\u00b0C.",
