    "Reason": "1-(3-methoxybenzoyl)-2-(1-naphthoyl)hydrazine is a compound with several functional groups. The basic unit we can compare to is benzoic acid, which has a melting point around 122\u00b0C. The presence of a hydrazine group (-NH-NH2) can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +20\u00b0C. The 3-methoxybenzoyl group (COc1cccc(c1)C(=O)OCH3) includes a phenyl ring and a methoxy group, which can each add roughly +10\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The 1-naphthoyl group (C(=O)c2cccc3c2cccc3) has a larger fused ring structure, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
