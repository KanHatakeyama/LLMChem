    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is glycine, which has a melting point of 232.4\u00b0C. Penicillamine has a sulfhydryl group (-SH) instead of a carboxyl group (-COOH) in glycine. The sulfhydryl group is less polar than the carboxyl group, which reduces the hydrogen bonding potential and thus lowers the melting point. The presence of the sulfur atom also increases the molecular weight and size, which tends to increase the melting point. The net effect of these changes is a decrease in the melting point compared to glycine.",
