    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole is a derivative of anisole, which has a melting point of 2\u00b0C. The presence of a chlorine atom in the para position increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to form stronger London dispersion forces. This effect is estimated to be around +10\u00b0C. Additionally, the methyl group in the ortho position increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to form weak C-H...\u03c0 interactions. This effect is estimated to be around +5\u00b0C.",
