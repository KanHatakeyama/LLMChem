    "Reason": "The melting point of N-hexadecane can be estimated by considering the melting points of its isomers. The melting point of a straight-chain alkane increases with the number of carbon atoms due to the increased van der Waals forces between the longer chains. The melting point of N-hexadecane is expected to be higher than that of its branched isomers. The melting point of a straight-chain alkane with 16 carbon atoms is approximately 18.2\u00b0C.",
