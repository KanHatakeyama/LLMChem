    "Reason": "1,2-bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone is a derivative of benzene with two amino groups and a ketone group. The melting point of benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two amino groups increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight. Each amino group can contribute approximately +30\u00b0C to +50\u00b0C, totaling +60\u00b0C to +100\u00b0C. The ketone group also increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C to +40\u00b0C. The overall melting point increase is estimated to be around +80\u00b0C to +140\u00b0C.",
