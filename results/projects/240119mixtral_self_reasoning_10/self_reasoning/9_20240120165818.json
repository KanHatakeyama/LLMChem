    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit, benzaldehyde, has a melting point of 9.8\u00b0C. The methoxy groups (OC) can increase the melting point by about +5\u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The iodine atom (I) is a heavy halogen atom, which can increase the melting point by about +20\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for weak dipole interactions. The aldehyde group (CO) can increase the melting point by about +10\u00b0C due to the polar carbonyl interactions.",
