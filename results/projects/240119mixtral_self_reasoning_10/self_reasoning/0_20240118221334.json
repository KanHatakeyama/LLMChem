    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114\u00b0C. The presence of a chlorine atom in the ortho position to the amide group introduces steric hindrance, which can disrupt the crystal lattice and lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The fluorine atom in the para position to the amide group is smaller than chlorine and has a lower electronegativity, which results in less steric hindrance and a smaller impact on the melting point, estimated at around -5\u00b0C. The combined effect of the chlorine and fluorine atoms is a decrease in the melting point compared to acetanilide.",
