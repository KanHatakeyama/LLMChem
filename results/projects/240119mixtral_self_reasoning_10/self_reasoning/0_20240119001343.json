    "Reason": "1-aminoanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid is a derivative of anthraquinone, which has a melting point of 286\u00b0C. The presence of an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group in this compound can significantly affect the melting point. The amino group can form hydrogen bonds with the carboxylic acid group, increasing the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group can also form hydrogen bonds with the anthraquinone core, further increasing the melting point by around +10\u00b0C.",
