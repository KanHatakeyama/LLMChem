    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane is a simple alkyl fluoride with a pentyl chain. The melting point of the parent compound, pentane, is -129.8\u00b0C. The introduction of a fluorine atom in the 1-position slightly increases the melting point due to the electronegativity of fluorine, which can create a weak dipole-dipole interaction. However, the effect is relatively small, estimated at around +1\u00b0C for this structural modification.",
