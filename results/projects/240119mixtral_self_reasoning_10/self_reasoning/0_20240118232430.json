    "Reason": "1,2-Ethanediamine (with a melting point of 8.5\u00b0C) can be used as a basic unit for comparison. The addition of two aminoethyl groups (CH2CH2NH2) to the ethylenediamine molecule will increase the molecular weight and the number of potential hydrogen bonding sites. This will increase the melting point due to the increased intermolecular forces. However, the additional ethylene groups also increase the flexibility of the molecule, which can lower the melting point. The net effect of these modifications is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
