    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate is a derivative of benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122.4\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also increases the molecular volume and reduces the intermolecular forces due to its non-polar nature. The net effect should thus be a slightly increased melting point compared to benzoic acid.",
