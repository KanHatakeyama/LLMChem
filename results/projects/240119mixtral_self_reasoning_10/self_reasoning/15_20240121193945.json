    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane has a basic unit of pentane, which has a melting point of -130.0\u00b0C. The introduction of a fluorine atom can increase the melting point due to the electronegativity difference between fluorine and carbon, which can lead to dipole-dipole interactions. However, the effect is relatively small, estimated at around +1\u00b0C for each fluorine atom.",
