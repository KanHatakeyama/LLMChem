    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane has a single fluorine atom attached to a pentane chain. The basic unit for comparison can be pentane, which has a melting point of -129.7 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a fluorine atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, fluorine has a smaller atomic radius than hydrogen, which can lead to a weaker van der Waals force. The net effect should thus be a slightly increased melting point due to the increase in molecular weight but a decreased melting point due to the weaker van der Waals forces.",
