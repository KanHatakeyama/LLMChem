    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has several functional groups that affect its melting point. The basic unit, benzaldehyde, has a melting point of -26 degrees Celsius. The methoxy groups (OC) increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, adding approximately 10 degrees Celsius each. The iodine atom (I) increases the melting point due to its large size and high electronegativity, adding around 40 degrees Celsius. The aldehyde group (CO) can form hydrogen bonds, adding approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The total increase in the melting point is (10 degrees Celsius x 2 methoxy groups) + 40 degrees Celsius (iodine) + 10 degrees Celsius (aldehyde) = 70 degrees Celsius.",
