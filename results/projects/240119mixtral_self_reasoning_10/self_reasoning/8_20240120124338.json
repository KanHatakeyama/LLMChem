    "Reason": "5-bromoindole has a basic unit of indole, which has a melting point of 52-54 \u00b0C. The bromine atom increases the molecular weight and introduces a halogen bond, which can increase the melting point. The bromine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20-30 \u00b0C due to its molecular weight and halogen bonding.",
