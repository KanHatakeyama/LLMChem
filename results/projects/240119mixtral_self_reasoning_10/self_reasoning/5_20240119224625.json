    "Reason": "1. The melting point of a hydrocarbon can be estimated based on its molecular weight. 2. The melting point of a hydrocarbon increases with the length of its carbon chain. 3. The melting point of a hydrocarbon increases by approximately 5-6\u00b0C for each additional -CH2- group. 4. N-hexadecane has 16 carbon atoms, which is equivalent to 14 -CH2- groups. 5. The melting point of N-hexadecane can be estimated by adding the contribution of each -CH2- group.",
