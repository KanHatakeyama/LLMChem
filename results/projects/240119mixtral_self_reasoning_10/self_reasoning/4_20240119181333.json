    "Reason": "5-bromoindole is a compound with a bromine atom attached to the indole ring. The indole ring itself is a bicyclic structure with a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring. The melting point of indole is 52-53\u00b0C. The bromine atom is a heavy halogen atom, which can increase the melting point due to its larger size and higher molecular weight compared to hydrogen. The bromine atom can also form a weak hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom in the indole ring, which can further increase the melting point. The bromine atom can be expected to increase the melting point by approximately 20-30\u00b0C.",
