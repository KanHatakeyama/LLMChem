    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile is a derivative of benzonitrile, which has a melting point of -13\u00b0C. The trifluoromethyl group (CF3) is a polar and electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point due to the following factors: (1) The polar nature of the CF3 group can increase the dipole moment of the molecule, which can enhance intermolecular forces and raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C; (2) The electron-withdrawing effect of the CF3 group can increase the acidity of the nitrile group, which can lead to stronger hydrogen bonding and further increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Benzonitrile base (-13\u00b0C), polar CF3 group (+10\u00b0C), and electron-withdrawing CF3 group (+10\u00b0C).",
