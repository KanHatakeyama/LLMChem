    "Reason": "4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine has a basic unit we can compare to: piperidine, which has a melting point of 106-107 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine will affect its melting point: (1) The chlorophenyl group (c1cc(ccc1)) increases molecular weight and rigidity, which can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity; (2) The hydroxyl group (O) increases hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point due to the formation of additional hydrogen bonds. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
