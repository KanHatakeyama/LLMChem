    "Reason": "2-pyridineacetamide is a derivative of acetamide, which has a melting point of 82 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring in 2-pyridineacetamide increases the molecular weight and rigidity, which can increase the melting point. However, the presence of the pyridine ring also introduces the possibility of additional hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring and the carbonyl oxygen atom in the acetamide group. This additional hydrogen bonding can decrease the melting point. The net effect of these modifications is a melting point that is higher than acetamide but not as high as the increase due to molecular weight and rigidity alone.",
