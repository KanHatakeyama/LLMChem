    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile has a basic unit of benzonitrile, which has a melting point around -13\u00b0C. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight, electronegativity, and the potential for hydrogen bonding. Each fluorine atom can add approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point. The trifluoromethyl group has three fluorine atoms, which can add approximately +30\u00b0C to the melting point.",
