    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a pyrrole base unit with a melting point around -25 \u00b0C. The presence of a phenylsulfonyl group significantly increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +100\u00b0C. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point increase due to the potential for pi-stacking interactions, which can add around +20\u00b0C.",
