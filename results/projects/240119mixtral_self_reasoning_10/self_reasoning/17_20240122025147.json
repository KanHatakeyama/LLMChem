    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol has a basic unit of ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The methoxy group can be estimated to add approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point.",
