    "Reason": "2,3,4,5-Tetrabromophenol is a derivative of phenol, which has a melting point of 43\u00b0C. The presence of four bromine atoms significantly increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the formation of intermolecular halogen bonds. Each bromine atom can be estimated to add approximately 30\u00b0C to the melting point. The methyl group, on the other hand, tends to lower the melting point due to the disruption of the crystal lattice symmetry. However, the effect of the methyl group is relatively small compared to the impact of the bromine atoms.",
