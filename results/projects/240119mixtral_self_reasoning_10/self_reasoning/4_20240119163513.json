    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a pyrrole ring and a phenylsulfonyl group. The pyrrole ring is a five-membered aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom. The presence of the nitrogen atom in the ring makes it polar, which can increase the melting point. The phenylsulfonyl group is a polar group that can also increase the melting point due to the presence of the sulfur atom and the two oxygen atoms. The melting point of a compound is influenced by the intermolecular forces between its molecules. The polar nature of the pyrrole ring and the phenylsulfonyl group can increase the intermolecular forces, leading to a higher melting point.",
