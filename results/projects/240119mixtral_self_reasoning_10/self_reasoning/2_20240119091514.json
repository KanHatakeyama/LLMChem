    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole is a derivative of anisole, which has a melting point of 25.0\u00b0C. The presence of a chlorine atom in the para position increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to form stronger London dispersion forces. The chlorine atom also introduces a polar effect, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces. The melting point increase due to a chlorine atom in the para position is approximately +10\u00b0C. The methyl group in the ortho position increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to form stronger London dispersion forces. The melting point increase due to a methyl group in the ortho position is approximately +5\u00b0C.",
