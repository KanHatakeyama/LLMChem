    "Reason": "1-aminoanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid is a derivative of anthraquinone, which has a melting point of 286\u00b0C. The presence of an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group can significantly impact the melting point. The amino group can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, adding another +10\u00b0C to the melting point.",
