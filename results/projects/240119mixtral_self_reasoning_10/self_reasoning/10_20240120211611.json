    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene has a basic unit of toluene, which has a melting point around -95\u00b0C. The introduction of two ethyl groups in the 1,3-positions increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the ethyl groups also increase the molecular volume and introduce more asymmetry, which can lower the melting point due to reduced crystal lattice stability. The net effect should thus be a slightly increased melting point compared to toluene.",
