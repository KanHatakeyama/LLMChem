    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups. The basic unit for comparison can be indole-3-one, which has a melting point of 170-172 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a phenyl group (\u2013C6H5) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size which generally raises the melting point. The presence of the nitro group (\u2013NO2) also increases the molecular weight and size, but it can lower the melting point due to the presence of a polar group that can participate in hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a raised melting point due to the phenyl group, but a slightly lower melting point due to the nitro group.",
