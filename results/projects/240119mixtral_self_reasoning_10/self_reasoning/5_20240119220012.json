    "Reason": "1,4-Benzenediol (catechol) has a melting point of 104.0\u00b0C. The introduction of the nitro group (-NO2) and the acetate group (-COOCH3) will significantly alter the melting point. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the intermolecular forces due to dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding. The acetate group, on the other hand, is a weak electron-withdrawing group, but it can participate in hydrogen bonding. The net effect of these two groups is an increase in melting point due to the increased intermolecular forces. However, the exact impact is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
