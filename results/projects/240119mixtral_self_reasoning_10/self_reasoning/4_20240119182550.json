    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole is a derivative of anisole, which has a melting point of 24.8\u00b0C. The presence of a chlorine atom in the para position increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the ability to form weak dipole-dipole interactions. The chlorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10\u00b0C. The methyl group in the ortho position increases the molecular volume and adds to the steric hindrance, which can slightly increase the melting point due to the difficulty in packing the molecules. The methyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 2\u00b0C.",
