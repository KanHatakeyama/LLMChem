    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide has a basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the benzyl group (CH2C6H5) increases the molecular weight and introduces additional van der Waals interactions, contributing approximately +20\u00b0C. The thiosemicarbazide group (NNC(=S)N) has a significant impact due to the presence of the thiocarbonyl group (C=S) and the two amide-like functionalities, which can participate in hydrogen bonding. The thiocarbonyl group is a stronger electron-withdrawing group than a carbonyl, which increases the dipole moment and intermolecular forces, contributing approximately +50\u00b0C. The two amide-like functionalities can each add around +30\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding. The total estimated increase in melting point is +100\u00b0C.",
