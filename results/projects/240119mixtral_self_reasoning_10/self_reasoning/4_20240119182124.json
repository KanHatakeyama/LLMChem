    "Reason": "1-methyl-4-nitronaphthalene is a derivative of naphthalene, which has a melting point of 80.2\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group (\u2013CH3) in place of a hydrogen atom increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group is a non-polar group, and its introduction does not significantly affect the hydrogen bonding potential. The nitro group (\u2013NO2) is a polar group that can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules. The presence of the nitro group increases the hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the melting point. Taking the effect of the methyl and nitro groups into consideration, we can predict a net increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to additional hydrogen bonding. The net effect should thus be a decreased melting point but not as low as the increase observed with ethanol's hydrogen bonding alone.",
