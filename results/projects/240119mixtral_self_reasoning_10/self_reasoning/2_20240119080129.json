    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the oxime group (OC(=NOCC)) and the ether group (OC) will significantly affect the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The oxime group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C due to hydrogen bonding, and the ether group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to dipole-dipole interactions. The chlorine atom (Cl) is a halogen substituent that increases the melting point due to its electronegativity, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The chlorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
