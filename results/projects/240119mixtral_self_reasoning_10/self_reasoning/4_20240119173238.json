    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene is a derivative of toluene, which has a melting point of -95\u00b0C. The introduction of two ethyl groups in the 1,3-positions increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the presence of these alkyl groups also increases the molecular volume and reduces the crystal lattice stability, which can lower the melting point. The net effect of these changes is difficult to predict without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
