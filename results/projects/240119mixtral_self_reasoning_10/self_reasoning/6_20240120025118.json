    "Reason": "1,2-bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone has a basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two amino groups increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +50\u00b0C each. The ketone group also has the potential for hydrogen bonding, contributing around +20\u00b0C. The ethanone group also increases the molecular weight, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Benzene base (+5.5\u00b0C), two amino groups (+100\u00b0C), one ketone group (+20\u00b0C), and one ethanone group (+10\u00b0C).",
