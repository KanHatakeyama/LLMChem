    "Reason": "1-methylnaphthalene has a melting point of 50.0 degrees Celsius. The addition of a nitro group (-NO2) increases the melting point due to the presence of a polar group that can participate in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The nitro group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 30 degrees Celsius.",
