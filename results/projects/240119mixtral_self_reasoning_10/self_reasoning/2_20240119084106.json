    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde is a compound with several functional groups. The basic unit, benzaldehyde, has a melting point of 9.5 degrees Celsius. The melting point of the compound can be estimated by considering the effects of the functional groups: (1) The iodine atom (I) is a heavy halogen atom which increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, contributing around +30 degrees Celsius; (2) The two methoxy groups (OC) increase the molecular weight and volume, which might minutely raise the melting point, but the presence of an ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) has a slight lowering effect because it does not participate in hydrogen bonding as intensely as a hydroxyl group would. The net effect of the methoxy groups is estimated to be around +5 degrees Celsius; (3) The aldehyde group (C=O) can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, contributing around +10 degrees Celsius. The total melting point shift is estimated to be the sum of these contributions.",
