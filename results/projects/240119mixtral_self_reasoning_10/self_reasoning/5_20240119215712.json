    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene is a derivative of toluene, which has a melting point of -95\u00b0C. The melting point of 1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene is expected to be higher than that of toluene due to the presence of two ethyl groups. The ethyl groups increase the molecular weight and introduce additional van der Waals interactions, which can increase the melting point. However, the ethyl groups also increase the molecular volume, which can reduce the packing efficiency in the crystal lattice and counteract the increase in melting point due to the van der Waals interactions. The net effect is a slightly higher melting point than that of toluene.",
