    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol is a derivative of ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. The presence of a methoxy group (-OCH3) increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The methoxy group can be estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
