    "Reason": "4-hydroxypiperidine has a melting point of 110-111\u00b0C. The presence of a 4-chlorophenyl group increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The chlorophenyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
