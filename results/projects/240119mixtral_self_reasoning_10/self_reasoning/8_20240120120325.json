    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene is a derivative of toluene, which has a melting point around -95\u00b0C. The presence of two ethyl groups in the 1,3-positions increases the molecular weight and volume, which raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. However, the ethyl groups also increase the molecular asymmetry, which can reduce the crystal lattice stability. The net effect is a slight increase in the melting point.",
