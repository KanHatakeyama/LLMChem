    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a trimesic acid derivative, which can be considered as a derivative of benzene. The basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Each phenyl group increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity. Each phenyl group can add approximately +30 to +50\u00b0C. The presence of three phenyl groups in 1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl should significantly increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity.",
