    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole is a compound with a phenyl group attached to the imidazole ring. The basic unit for comparison can be imidazole, which has a melting point of 89.6\u00b0C. The introduction of the phenyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the phenyl group also introduces a more rigid structure and increases the potential for dipole-dipole interactions. Taking the effect of the phenyl group into consideration, we can predict an increase due to molecular size and rigidity but a more significant increase due to additional dipole-dipole interactions. The net effect should thus be a significantly increased melting point.",
