    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The molecular structure includes two methoxy groups, which can raise the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C due to additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding. The aldehyde group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point by approximately +50 \u00b0C due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds and increased molecular rigidity. The iodine atom is a heavy halogen, which can increase the melting point by about +20 \u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and London dispersion forces.",
