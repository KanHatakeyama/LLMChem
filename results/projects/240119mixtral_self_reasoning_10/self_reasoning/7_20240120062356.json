    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene can be compared to 1-butene, which has a melting point of -138.4\u00b0C. The cyclopentene ring formation increases the molecular weight and introduces a more rigid structure, which generally raises the melting point. However, the cyclopentene ring also reduces the symmetry of the molecule. The presence of a methyl group in the 1-position increases the molecular weight and size, which further raises the melting point. The net effect should be a higher melting point than 1-butene.",
