    "Reason": "1,2-bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone is a compound with two amino groups attached to a ketone. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the amino groups increases the melting point due to the hydrogen bonding potential and the increased molecular weight. The ketone group also increases the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. The amino groups can form hydrogen bonds with the ketone group, further increasing the melting point. The overall effect is a significant increase in the melting point due to the presence of the amino groups and the ketone group.",
