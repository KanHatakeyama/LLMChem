    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be glycine, which has a melting point of 232.0 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in penicillamine will affect its melting point: (1) The sulfur atom (S) is a larger atom than nitrogen, which can increase the molecular volume and add about +10 to the melting point; (2) The thiol group (\u2013SH) can form hydrogen bonds, which can lower the melting point by about -20 due to the increased intermolecular interactions; (3) The amide group (O=C(O)[C@H](N)) is a polar group that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can lower the melting point by about -30 due to the increased intermolecular interactions; (4) The methyl group (C) is a small alkyl group that can increase the molecular volume and add about +5 to the melting point. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
