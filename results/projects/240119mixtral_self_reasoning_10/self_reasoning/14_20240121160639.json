    "Reason": "Penicillamine has a basic unit of a thiol group (\u2013SH) and an amide group (\u2013CONH2). The thiol group has a stronger hydrogen bonding capacity than the amide group, which can increase the melting point. However, the amide group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, albeit less strongly than the thiol group. The presence of the amide group can thus slightly lower the melting point due to the reduced hydrogen bonding capacity of the thiol group. The molecular weight increase due to the amide group will also contribute to a slight increase in the melting point.",
