    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile has a basic unit of benzonitrile, which has a melting point around -13\u00b0C. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group generally increases the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight, electronegativity, and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +40\u00b0C. The net effect is a significant increase in the melting point due to the trifluoromethyl group.",
