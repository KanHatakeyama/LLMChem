    "Reason": "3-hydroxy-4-iodobenzoic acid has three functional groups: a hydroxyl group, a carboxylic acid group, and an iodine atom. The basic unit for comparison is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122.4\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group also increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +20\u00b0C. The iodine atom increases the melting point due to its large size and high polarizability, which can raise it by approximately +50\u00b0C.",
