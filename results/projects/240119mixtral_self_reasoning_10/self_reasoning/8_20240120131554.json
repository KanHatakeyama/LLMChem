    "Reason": "2-Pyridineacetamide is a derivative of pyridine, which has a melting point of -41.6\u00b0C. The introduction of the acetamide group (\u2013CONH2) increases the molecular weight and introduces hydrogen bonding potential. The acetamide group can form hydrogen bonds with the pyridine nitrogen atom, which increases the melting point due to the additional hydrogen bonding. The acetamide group can also form hydrogen bonds with other acetamide groups, which increases the melting point further. The net effect is a significant increase in the melting point due to the introduction of the acetamide group.",
