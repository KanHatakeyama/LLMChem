    "Reason": "2-pyridineacetamide has a basic unit of pyridine, which has a melting point of -41.6\u00b0C. The introduction of the acetamide group increases the molecular weight and introduces hydrogen bonding potential, which raises the melting point. The acetamide group can participate in hydrogen bonding with the pyridine nitrogen atom, which increases the melting point due to the additional hydrogen bonding. The acetamide group can also form hydrogen bonds with other acetamide groups, which increases the melting point due to the increased hydrogen bonding. The net effect is a significant increase in the melting point due to the introduction of the acetamide group.",
