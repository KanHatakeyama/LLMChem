    "Reason": "1,2-bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone has a basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The compound has two amino groups, which can form hydrogen bonds and increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C each. The ketone group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by around +20\u00b0C. The ethanone group also increases the molecular weight and rigidity, which can add another +10\u00b0C.",
