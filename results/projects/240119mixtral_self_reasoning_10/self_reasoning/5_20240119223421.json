    "Reason": "1,2-dicarboxylic acids generally have a melting point around 200\u00b0C. The presence of a cyclohexene ring introduces a more flexible structure, which can lower the melting point due to a less organized crystal lattice. The cis configuration further reduces the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and reduced planarity compared to the trans isomer. The cis-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid molecule has a more flexible structure than the typical 1,2-dicarboxylic acid, which can lead to a lower melting point.",
