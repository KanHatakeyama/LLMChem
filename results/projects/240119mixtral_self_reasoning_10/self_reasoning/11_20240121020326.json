    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit we can compare to is benzaldehyde, which has a melting point around 9 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde will affect its melting point: (1) The two methoxy groups (OC) can each add approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding; (2) The iodine atom (I) can add approximately +40 due to its large size and the strong van der Waals forces it creates; (3) The aldehyde group (C=O) can add approximately +20 due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
