    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is styrene, which has a melting point of -30.6 \u00b0C. The presence of an acetyl group increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The acetyl group can be estimated to add approximately +50 \u00b0C to the melting point due to increased dipole-dipole interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
