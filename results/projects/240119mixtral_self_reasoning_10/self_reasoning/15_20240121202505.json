    "Reason": "4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine has a basic unit we can compare to: piperidine, which has a melting point of 106.3 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine will affect its melting point: (1) The chlorophenyl group (c1cc(ccc1)) can add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The hydroxyl group (O) can add about +10 due to hydrogen bonding potential. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
