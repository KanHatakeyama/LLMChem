    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene is a derivative of toluene, which has a melting point of -95 \u00b0C. The addition of two ethyl groups in the 1,3-positions increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the ethyl groups also introduce more conformational freedom, which can lower the melting point. The net effect of these changes is a slightly elevated melting point compared to toluene.",
