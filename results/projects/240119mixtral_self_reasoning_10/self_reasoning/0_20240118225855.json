    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide is a compound with several functional groups that can affect its melting point. To estimate the melting point, we can compare it to a simpler compound, such as acetamide, which has a melting point of 82\u00b0C. The additional functional groups and structural features in 4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide will affect its melting point: (1) The benzyl group (c1ccc(cc1)) adds about +20\u00b0C due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The thiosemicarbazide group (NC(=S)NN) can significantly increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding about +50\u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
