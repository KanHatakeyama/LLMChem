    "Reason": "4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. Starting with the basic unit of piperidine, which has a melting point of 34.3\u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The presence of a chlorophenyl group contributes to an increase in molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, with an approximate increase of +20\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group introduces hydrogen bonding, which can significantly increase the melting point due to the formation of strong intermolecular interactions. The hydroxyl group can contribute approximately +50\u00b0C to the melting point. The piperidine ring itself is a rigid structure, which can also increase the melting point due to the reduced conformational freedom. The overall effect of the piperidine ring is estimated to be around +20\u00b0C.",
