    "Reason": "1,3-butadiene has a melting point of -108.9\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is cyclobutane, which has a melting point of -120.0\u00b0C. The methylene- bridge introduces a double bond, which increases the melting point due to increased rigidity and pi-pi interactions. Each double bond can be estimated to add approximately +10\u00b0C to the melting point.",
