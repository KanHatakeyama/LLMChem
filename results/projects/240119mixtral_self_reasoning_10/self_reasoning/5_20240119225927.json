    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole is a derivative of anisole, which has a melting point of -7.5 \u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine atom in the para position increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the ability to form stronger intermolecular forces. The chlorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +15 \u00b0C. The methyl group in the ortho position increases the molecular weight and adds a slight steric hindrance effect, which can increase the melting point by about +5 \u00b0C.",
