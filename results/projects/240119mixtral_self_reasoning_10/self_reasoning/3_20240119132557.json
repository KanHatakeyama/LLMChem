    "Reason": "5-bromoindole is a derivative of indole, which has a melting point of 52-54\u00b0C. The bromine atom is a heavy halogen atom that can increase the melting point due to its large size and strong electronegativity, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The bromine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20-30\u00b0C.",
