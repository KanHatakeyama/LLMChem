    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenol has a melting point of 112-113\u00b0C. The presence of the cyano group (-CN) increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. However, the para-positioning of the cyano group in p-cyanophenol has a more significant effect than the ortho-positioning in 4-cyanophenol due to the increased symmetry and crystal lattice stability. The net effect should thus be a higher melting point for p-cyanophenol compared to 4-cyanophenol.",
