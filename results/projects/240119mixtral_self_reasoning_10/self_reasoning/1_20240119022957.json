    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzotrifluoride, which has a melting point of -39.0\u00b0C. The introduction of a fluorine atom in the ortho position tends to increase the melting point due to the enhanced dipole-dipole interactions and the increased molecular weight. The ortho position is expected to have a more significant impact on the melting point than the meta or para positions due to the increased steric hindrance and the potential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The melting point increase can be estimated to be around +10\u00b0C for the ortho fluorine substitution.",
