    "Reason": "4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine has a chlorophenyl group and a hydroxyl group. The chlorophenyl group increases the melting point due to the electronegativity of the chlorine atom, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The hydroxyl group increases the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. The net effect is a higher melting point than the basic unit, which can be a phenol or a chlorobenzene.",
