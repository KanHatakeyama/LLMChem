    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The xanthene molecule contains two benzene rings fused with a dihydropyran ring. The fusion of the benzene rings increases the rigidity of the molecule, which raises the melting point. The dihydropyran ring also increases the molecular weight and introduces a polar oxygen atom, which can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. The net effect of these modifications is a significant increase in the melting point compared to benzene.",
