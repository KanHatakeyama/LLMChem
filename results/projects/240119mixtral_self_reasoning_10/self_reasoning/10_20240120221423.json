    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is biphenyl, which has a melting point around 69-70\u00b0C. The presence of an acetyl group generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. However, the acetyl group also increases the molecular weight and introduces a rigid structure, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
