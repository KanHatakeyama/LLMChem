    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is glycine, which has a melting point of 232 degrees Celsius. Penicillamine is a derivative of glycine with a sulfhydryl group (\u2013SH) replacing the amino group (\u2013NH2). The sulfhydryl group is more polar than the amino group, which increases the potential for hydrogen bonding. However, the sulfur atom is larger than the nitrogen atom, which may decrease the hydrogen bonding potential. The net effect of these changes is a decrease in the melting point compared to glycine.",
