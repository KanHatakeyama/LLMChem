    "Reason": "2-Methoxyethanol is a derivative of ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1 degrees Celsius. The addition of a methoxy group (\u2013OCH3) increases the molecular weight and volume, which might minutely raise the melting point. However, the presence of an ether linkage (\u2013O\u2013) has a slight lowering effect because it does not participate in hydrogen bonding as intensely as a hydroxyl group would. The net effect of the methoxy group and ether linkage is estimated to be a slight increase in the melting point, around 5 degrees Celsius.",
