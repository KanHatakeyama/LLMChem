    "Reason": "2-methylcyclopentanone is a ketone with a cyclic structure. The basic unit, cyclopentane, has a melting point of -94.0 degrees Celsius. The ketone group (C=O) is expected to increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight. The methyl group (CH3) is a small alkyl substituent that increases the molecular volume and molecular weight, which should slightly increase the melting point. The cyclic structure also increases the molecular rigidity, which should further increase the melting point.",
