    "Reason": "2-pyridineacetamide is a derivative of acetamide, which has a melting point of 82.0 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring in 2-pyridineacetamide increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. The pyridine ring is estimated to add about +20 degrees Celsius to the melting point.",
