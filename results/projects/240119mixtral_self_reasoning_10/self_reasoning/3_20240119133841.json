    "Reason": "1-methyl-4-nitronaphthalene is a derivative of naphthalene, which has a melting point of 80.2\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a methyl group (-CH3) in the 1-methyl-4-nitronaphthalene molecule can influence its melting point. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the melting point due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The methyl group, on the other hand, is an electron-donating group that can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and van der Waals forces. However, the methyl group can also slightly decrease the melting point due to the disruption of the packing arrangement in the crystal lattice.",
