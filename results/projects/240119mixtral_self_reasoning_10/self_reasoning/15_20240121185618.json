    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzyl group increases the molecular weight and introduces pi-stacking interactions, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius. The thiosemicarbazide group has a significant influence due to the presence of a thiocarbonyl group (\u2013CS\u2013) and two amide groups (\u2013CONH\u2013). The thiocarbonyl group has a weaker dipole than a carbonyl group, but it can still participate in hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The two amide groups can participate in strong hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius each. The net effect of these functional groups is a significant increase in the melting point due to the increased molecular weight, pi-stacking interactions, and hydrogen bonding.",
