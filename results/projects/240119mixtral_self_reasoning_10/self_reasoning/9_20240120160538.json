    "Reason": "2-Pyridinecarboxamide, 3-hydroxy- has a basic unit of pyridinecarboxamide, which has a melting point around 210\u00b0C. The presence of a hydroxy group can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise it by approximately +10\u00b0C. However, the 3-hydroxy substitution tends to lower the melting point compared to pyridinecarboxamide, as it creates a more asymmetric structure, reducing the crystal lattice stability, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Pyridinecarboxamide base (+210\u00b0C), hydroxy group (+10\u00b0C), and 3-hydroxy substitution (-10\u00b0C).",
