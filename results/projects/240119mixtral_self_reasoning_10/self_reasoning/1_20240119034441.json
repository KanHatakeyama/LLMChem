    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene is a derivative of toluene (methylbenzene) with two ethyl groups attached at the 1 and 3 positions. The melting point of toluene is -95\u00b0C. The introduction of the ethyl groups increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the ethyl groups also increase the molecular volume and introduce more conformational freedom, which can lower the melting point. The net effect should be a slightly increased melting point compared to toluene.",
