    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzamide, which has a melting point of 43.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a sulfonamide group and a cyclohexyl ring. Sulfonamide groups tend to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. In the case of Zonisamide, we have a sulfonamide group attached to the benzamide ring, which would notably augment the melting point. The cyclohexyl ring also increases the molecular weight and adds to the rigidity of the structure. Each additional structural feature can be estimated to add approximately 50\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
