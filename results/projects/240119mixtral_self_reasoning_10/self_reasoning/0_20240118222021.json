    "Reason": "The basic unit, cyclopentane, has a melting point of -94.0 degrees Celsius. The addition of an octyl chain increases the molecular weight and the potential for van der Waals interactions, which generally raises the melting point. The octyl chain is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20 degrees Celsius for each carbon atom, giving a total increase of (20 degrees Celsius x 8 carbons) = 160 degrees Celsius.",
