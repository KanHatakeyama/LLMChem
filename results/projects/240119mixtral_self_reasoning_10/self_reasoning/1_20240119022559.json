    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a trimesic acid derivative with three benzene rings connected by phenyl linkages. The melting point of benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. Each phenyl linkage contributes to the overall rigidity and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, which can increase the melting point by approximately +30 to +50\u00b0C. Since there are three phenyl linkages, the total contribution would be around +90 to +150\u00b0C.",
