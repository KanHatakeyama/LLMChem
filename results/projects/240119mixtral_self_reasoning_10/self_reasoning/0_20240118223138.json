    "Reason": "##The basic unit, acrylate, has a melting point of -83.6 degrees Celsius. The tert-butyl group is a bulky group which increases the molecular volume and steric hindrance, leading to a higher melting point. The tert-butyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20 degrees Celsius.",
