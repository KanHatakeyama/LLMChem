    "Reason": "The melting point of N-hexadecane can be estimated by considering the melting point of its lower homolog, N-pentadecane, which has a melting point of 5.9\u00b0C. The melting point increases with the molecular weight due to the stronger van der Waals interactions. The melting point increase is approximately +1.5\u00b0C for each additional CH2 group. For N-hexadecane, which has two more CH2 groups than N-pentadecane, the estimated increase is +3.0\u00b0C.",
