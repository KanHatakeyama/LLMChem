    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile is a derivative of benzonitrile, which has a melting point of -13.2 degrees Celsius. The trifluoromethyl group is electron-withdrawing, increasing the compound's overall polarity and dipole moment. This leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise the melting point. The trifluoromethyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius.",
