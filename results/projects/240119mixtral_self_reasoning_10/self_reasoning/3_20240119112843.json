    "Reason": "1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane is a perfluorinated compound, which means that all hydrogen atoms in the ethane molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms. The presence of fluorine atoms in the molecule significantly increases the melting point compared to the parent compound, ethane (\u2212182.8 \u00b0C). The fluorine atoms increase the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. However, the electronegativity of fluorine also increases the dipole moment of the molecule, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces and a further increase in the melting point.",
