    "Reason": "1,3-diethyl-5-methylbenzene has a basic unit of toluene, which has a melting point around -95\u00b0C. The introduction of two ethyl groups in the 1,3-positions increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point due to increased van der Waals interactions. However, the ethyl groups also increase the molecular volume and introduce asymmetry, which can lower the melting point due to reduced crystal lattice stability. Taking the effect of the ethyl groups into consideration, we can predict a net increase due to molecular size but a more significant decrease due to the asymmetry. The net effect should thus be a slightly increased melting point compared to toluene.",
