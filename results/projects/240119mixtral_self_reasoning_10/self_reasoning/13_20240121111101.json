    "Reason": "2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride has a benzene ring with two methoxy groups and a carboxylic acid derivative. The basic unit, benzoyl chloride, has a melting point of 21.0 degrees Celsius. The methoxy groups increase the molecular weight and allow for hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. Each methoxy group can be estimated to add approximately +10 degrees Celsius due to molecular weight and +5 degrees Celsius due to hydrogen bonding, for a total increase of +15 degrees Celsius per methoxy group. The carboxylic acid derivative increases the molecular weight and introduces a polar group, which can increase the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions. The carboxylic acid derivative can be estimated to add approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
