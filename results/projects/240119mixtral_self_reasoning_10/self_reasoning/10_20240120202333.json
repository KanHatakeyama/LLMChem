    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene is a derivative of cyclopentene, which has a melting point of -127.6 \u00b0C. The addition of a methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces a slight increase in molecular flexibility due to the additional carbon-carbon bond. The net effect should be a slightly increased melting point compared to cyclopentene, but not significantly.",
