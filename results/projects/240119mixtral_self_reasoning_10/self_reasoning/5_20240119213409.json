    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point around 5\u00b0C. The presence of the oxime group (OC(=NOCC)) and the ether group (OC) will affect the melting point. The oxime group can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, contributing approximately +30\u00b0C. The ether group can also increase the melting point due to dipole-dipole interactions, contributing approximately +10\u00b0C. However, the presence of the chlorine atom (Cl) in the benzene ring can decrease the melting point due to steric hindrance and the disruption of the crystal lattice, contributing approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
