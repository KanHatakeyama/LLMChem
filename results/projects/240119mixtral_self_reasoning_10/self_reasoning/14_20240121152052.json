    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane is a simple alkyl fluoride. The basic unit we can compare to is pentane, which has a melting point of -130.1 \u00b0C. The presence of a fluorine atom in 1-fluoropentane increases the melting point due to the electronegativity of fluorine, which can increase the dipole moment and allow for weak dipole-dipole interactions. The effect of a single fluorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +10 \u00b0C.",
