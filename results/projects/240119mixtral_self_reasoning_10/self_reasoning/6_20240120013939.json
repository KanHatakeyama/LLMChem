    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a pyrrole base unit with a melting point of -25.0 \u00b0C. The presence of a phenylsulfonyl group significantly increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The sulfonyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +100 \u00b0C. The phenyl group also contributes to the melting point increase due to molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, adding approximately +20 \u00b0C.",
