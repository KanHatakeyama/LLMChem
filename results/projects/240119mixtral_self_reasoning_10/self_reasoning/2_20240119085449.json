    "Reason": "4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid is a compound with a cyclohexene ring and two carboxylic acid groups. The basic unit for comparison is cyclohexene, which has a melting point of -103.2\u00b0C. The presence of the two carboxylic acid groups significantly alters the physical properties compared to cyclohexene. Carboxylic acid groups can form hydrogen bonds, which increase the melting point due to the formation of stronger intermolecular forces. The cis configuration of the double bond also introduces a more rigid structure, which can further increase the melting point. Considering the effect of the carboxylic acid groups and the cis configuration, we can predict a significant increase in the melting point.",
