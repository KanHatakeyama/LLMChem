    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde is a derivative of benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 9.8\u00b0C. The presence of the iodine atom in the ortho position increases the molecular weight and introduces a strong dipole, which can raise the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The two methoxy groups also increase the molecular weight and introduce hydrogen bonding potential, which can further increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
