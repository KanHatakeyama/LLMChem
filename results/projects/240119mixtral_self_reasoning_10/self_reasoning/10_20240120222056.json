    "Reason": "2-Pyridineacetamide has a pyridine ring and an acetamide group. The basic unit for comparison can be acetamide, which has a melting point of 82.0\u00b0C. The pyridine ring has a planar structure and can participate in pi-pi interactions, which increases the melting point. The presence of a pyridine ring can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
