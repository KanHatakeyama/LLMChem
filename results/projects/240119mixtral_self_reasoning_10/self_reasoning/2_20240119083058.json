    "Reason": "1,2-bis(4-aminophenyl)ethanone is a derivative of benzene with two amino groups and a ketone group. The melting point of benzene is 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of two amino groups increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight. Each amino group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 50\u00b0C, giving a total increase of (50\u00b0C x 2 amino groups) = 100\u00b0C. The ketone group also increases the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight, contributing approximately 40\u00b0C. The total increase in the melting point is 100\u00b0C (amino groups) + 40\u00b0C (ketone group) = 140\u00b0C.",
