    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoate is a derivative of benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122.4\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which generally raises the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces a steric hindrance effect, which can slightly lower the melting point due to the difficulty in packing the molecules. The phenyl group in the para position increases the molecular weight and size, which raises the melting point. The phenyl group also introduces a planar structure, which can increase the melting point due to the increased pi-pi interactions. The net effect of these structural modifications is a higher melting point than the base unit.",
