    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole has a basic unit, methylanisole, which has a melting point of -5.0 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom is a halogen which increases the melting point due to stronger electronegativity and dipole-dipole interactions. The chlorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 20 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of 20 degrees Celsius.",
