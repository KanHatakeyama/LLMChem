    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoic acid has a melting point around 120\u00b0C. The methyl ester group increases the molecular weight and introduces a potential for hydrogen bonding, which can raise the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C. The methyl group also introduces a slight asymmetry, which can reduce the crystal lattice stability, but the effect is not significant for a single methyl group.",
