    "Reason": "2-amino-5-chloro-3-fluoropyridine is a compound with a pyridine ring and three functional groups: amino, chloro, and fluorine. The melting point of the base molecule, pyridine, is 25.3\u00b0C. The amino group is a polar group that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point by approximately 50\u00b0C. The chloro group is a halogen substituent that increases the melting point by about 20\u00b0C due to its electronegativity and the resulting dipole-dipole interactions. The fluorine atom is also a halogen substituent, but it has a smaller effect on the melting point, estimated at around 10\u00b0C.",
