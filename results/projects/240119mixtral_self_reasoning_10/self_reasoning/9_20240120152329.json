    "Reason": "1,1':4',1''-Terphenyl is a trimesic acid derivative with three phenyl groups connected by two ether linkages. To estimate the melting point, we can start with the melting point of benzene (5.5\u00b0C) and consider the following contributions:\n- Phenyl groups: The three phenyl groups should significantly increase the melting point due to their ability to enhance \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and overall molecular rigidity. Each phenyl group may contribute around +30 to +50\u00b0C.\n- Ether linkages: The two ether linkages can increase the molecular weight and add some rigidity, but they do not significantly contribute to the melting point. We can estimate this at around +5 to +10\u00b0C for both ether linkages.\nGiven these considerations, we would sum the contributions to benzene's melting point: +90 to +150\u00b0C for the phenyl groups, and +5 to +10\u00b0C for the ether linkages.",
