    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane is a pentane derivative with a single fluorine atom attached to the first carbon atom. The melting point of pentane is -129.8\u00b0C. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and its presence in a molecule increases the overall dipole moment due to the electronegativity difference between fluorine and carbon. The increased dipole moment leads to stronger intermolecular forces, which in turn increases the melting point. The melting point increase due to a single fluorine atom is estimated to be around 10-15\u00b0C.",
