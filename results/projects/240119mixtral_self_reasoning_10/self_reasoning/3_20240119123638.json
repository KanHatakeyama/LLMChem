    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile is a derivative of benzonitrile, which has a melting point of -13.2\u00b0C. The introduction of the trifluoromethyl group (\u2013CF3) increases the molecular weight and introduces a strong electron-withdrawing effect, which increases the dipole moment and intermolecular forces. This leads to a higher melting point compared to the parent compound. The trifluoromethyl group is a relatively small and rigid group, which does not significantly affect the molecular symmetry. The net effect is an increase in the melting point due to the electron-withdrawing effect and the increased molecular weight.",
