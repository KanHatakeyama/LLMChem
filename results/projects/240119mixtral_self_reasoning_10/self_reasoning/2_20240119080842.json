    "Reason": "2-phenylimidazole is a compound with a phenyl group and an imidazole ring. The phenyl group is a benzene ring with a substituent, which increases the melting point due to increased molecular rigidity and pi-stacking interactions. The imidazole ring is a five-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms, which can form hydrogen bonds and increase the melting point. The melting point of benzene is 5.5\u00b0C, and the melting point of imidazole is 90\u00b0C. The melting point of 2-phenylimidazole is expected to be higher than both due to the combined effects of the phenyl group and the imidazole ring. The melting point of 2-phenylimidazole is estimated to be around 150\u00b0C.",
