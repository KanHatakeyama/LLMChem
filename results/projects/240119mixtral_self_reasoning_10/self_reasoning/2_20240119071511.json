    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine and fluorine atoms in the 3' and 4' positions, respectively, will affect the melting point. Halogen atoms are electron-withdrawing groups, and their presence can increase the melting point due to the following factors: (1) The halogen atoms can form hydrogen bonds with the amide group, which increases the intermolecular forces and the melting point; (2) The halogen atoms can also increase the molecular weight and molecular rigidity, which can further enhance the melting point. The chlorine atom is larger and more electronegative than the fluorine atom, so it will have a more significant effect on the melting point. We can estimate the effect of the halogen atoms as follows: (1) The chlorine atom may add around +10 to +20\u00b0C due to its larger size and higher electronegativity; (2) The fluorine atom may add around +5 to +10\u00b0C due to its smaller size and lower electronegativity.",
