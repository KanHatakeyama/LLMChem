    "Reason": "The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl ring connected to a benzene ring and the acetyl group. The additional phenyl ring increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The acetyl group, which is a carbonyl group attached to a methyl group, increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions.",
