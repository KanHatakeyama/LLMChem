    "Reason": "4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine has several functional groups which can influence the melting point. The basic unit for comparison can be piperidine, which has a melting point around -10 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a chlorophenyl group increases the molecular weight and introduces a dipole due to the chlorine atom. The dipole can increase the melting point due to increased intermolecular forces. The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding. However, the hydroxyl group can also increase the melting point due to the potential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which can reduce the molecular symmetry and increase the rigidity. The net effect of these functional groups is a significant increase in the melting point due to the chlorophenyl group and the hydroxyl group.",
