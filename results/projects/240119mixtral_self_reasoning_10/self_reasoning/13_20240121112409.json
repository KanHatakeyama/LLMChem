    "Reason": "1-aminoanthraquinone has a melting point around 240\u00b0C. The introduction of a carboxylic acid group increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +50\u00b0C. The presence of the amino group in the anthraquinone structure can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which might increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
