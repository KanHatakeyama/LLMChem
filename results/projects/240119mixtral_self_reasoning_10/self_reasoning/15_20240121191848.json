    "Reason": "3-hydroxy-4-iodobenzoic acid has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 122.4\u00b0C. The presence of a hydroxy group (\u2013OH) can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, but it can also increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight. The iodine atom (\u2013I) is a heavy halogen atom, which can increase the melting point due to its size and the increase in molecular weight. However, the iodine atom can also increase the melting point due to its ability to participate in halogen bonding, which can be stronger than hydrogen bonding. The net effect of these modifications is a significant increase in the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight, hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, and the presence of a carboxylic acid group.",
