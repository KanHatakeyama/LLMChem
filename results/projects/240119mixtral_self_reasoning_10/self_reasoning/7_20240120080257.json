    "Reason": "5-bromoindole is a derivative of indole, which has a melting point of 52-54\u00b0C. The bromine atom is a heavy halogen atom, which can increase the melting point due to its size and electronegativity. The bromine atom can form a halogen bond with the indole nitrogen atom, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The bromine atom can also increase the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The net effect of the bromine atom is a melting point increase of approximately +30\u00b0C.",
