    "Reason": "The melting point of N-hexadecane can be estimated by considering the melting point of its lower homologues. The melting point increases with the chain length due to the increase in van der Waals forces. The melting point of N-pentadecane (C15H32) is 18.2\u00b0C, and the melting point of N-hexadecane (C16H34) is expected to be higher due to the additional methyl group. The increase in melting point due to the addition of a methyl group can be estimated to be around 1.5\u00b0C.",
