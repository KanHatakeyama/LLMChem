    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenol has a melting point of 102-103\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is phenol, which has a melting point around 43\u00b0C. The introduction of the cyano group (\u2013CN) increases the molecular weight and introduces a strong dipole, which increases the melting point due to the enhancement of intermolecular forces. The cyano group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. However, the cyano group's presence might also slightly disrupt the crystal lattice due to its linear shape, which can slightly lower the melting point. Taking these effects into consideration, the net effect should be a higher melting point than phenol due to the cyano group's influence.",
