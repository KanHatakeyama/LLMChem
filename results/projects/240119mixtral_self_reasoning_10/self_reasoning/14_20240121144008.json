    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison can be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The introduction of a double bond increases the molecular rigidity, which generally raises the melting point due to increased pi-stacking interactions. The presence of a methyl group also increases the molecular weight and size, which can further raise the melting point. The net effect should thus be a significantly increased melting point compared to benzene.",
