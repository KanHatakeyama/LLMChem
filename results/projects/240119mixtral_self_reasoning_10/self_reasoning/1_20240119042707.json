    "Reason": "2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride is a derivative of benzoyl chloride, which has a melting point of 19.2\u00b0C. The presence of two methoxy groups in the 2,6-positions increases the molecular weight and introduces the potential for hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C each. The chlorine atom in the acyl chloride group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which increases the molecule's polarity and dipole moment, further raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.",
