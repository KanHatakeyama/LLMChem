    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one contains several functional groups that influence the melting point. The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of 52-54\u00b0C. The introduction of a phenyl group increases the molecular weight and van der Waals forces, raising the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The nitro group is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The ketone group introduces polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40\u00b0C. The net effect of these functional groups is an increase in the melting point. However, the exact impact of each group is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies.",
