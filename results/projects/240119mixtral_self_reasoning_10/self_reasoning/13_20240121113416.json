    "Reason": "The basic unit for our comparison will be benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C (according to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968-1969). The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phenyl ring and an acetyl group. The phenyl ring, when connected to a benzene ring, tends to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The acetyl group, which is a carbonyl group attached to a methyl group, can increase the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The acetyl group can be estimated to add approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight, dipole-dipole interactions, and potential hydrogen bonding. The phenyl ring can be estimated to add approximately +100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight.",
