    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is methylamine, which has a melting point of -93.4\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a phosphorus atom, a pyrophosphate group, and eight methyl groups. The phosphorus atom has a larger size and more polarizable electrons than nitrogen, which can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces. The pyrophosphate group introduces a more rigid structure and additional polar interactions, which can also increase the melting point. The eight methyl groups increase the molecular weight and add van der Waals interactions, which can further increase the melting point.",
