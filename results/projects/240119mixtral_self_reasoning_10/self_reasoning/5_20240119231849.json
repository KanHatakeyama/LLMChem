    "Reason": "Penicillamine is a derivative of the amino acid cysteine, which has a melting point of 240\u00b0C. The presence of the thiol group (-SH) in cysteine is responsible for its relatively high melting point. In penicillamine, the thiol group is replaced by a thioether group (-S-), which weakens the intermolecular interactions. The thioether group is less polar than the thiol group, and thus, the intermolecular forces are weaker. The thioether group is also bulkier, which can disrupt the crystal lattice and further reduce the melting point. The amide group (-N-C=O) in penicillamine can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point. However, the overall effect of the thioether group is expected to be a decrease in the melting point compared to cysteine.",
