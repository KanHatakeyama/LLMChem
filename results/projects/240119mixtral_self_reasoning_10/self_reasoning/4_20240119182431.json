    "Reason": "1-aminoanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid is a derivative of anthraquinone, which has a melting point of 286\u00b0C. The presence of the amino group (-NH2) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional groups can influence the melting point. The amino group can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point by approximately 10-20\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, but it can also form a dimer, which can lower the melting point. However, the overall effect of the carboxylic acid group is still an increase in the melting point by approximately 10-20\u00b0C. The combined effect of the amino and carboxylic acid groups is an increase in the melting point by approximately 20-40\u00b0C. Therefore, the predicted melting point for 1-aminoanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid is around 306-326\u00b0C.",
