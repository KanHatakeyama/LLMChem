    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a basic unit, pyrrole, which has a melting point around -20\u00b0C. The phenylsulfonyl group has a significant effect on the melting point due to the following: \n- The phenyl group increases the molecular weight and rigidity, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C.\n- The sulfonyl group (-S(=O)(=O)) has a strong electronegativity, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each sulfonyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C.",
