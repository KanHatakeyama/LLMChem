    "Reason": "The basic unit for this compound is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The structural modifications we need to consider are the presence of a second benzene ring fused to the first one and a dimethyl ether group. The fused benzene ring increases the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The dimethyl ether group, while not as impactful as the fused benzene ring, still contributes to the melting point through slight increases in molecular weight and weak dipole interactions. The fused benzene ring can be estimated to add approximately 100\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased pi-pi interactions, rigidity, and molecular weight. The dimethyl ether group can be estimated to add about 5\u00b0C to the melting point due to the slight increase in molecular weight and weak dipole interactions.",
