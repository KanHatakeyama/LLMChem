    "Reason": "2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride has a benzene ring with two methoxy groups and a carboxylic acid derivative. The basic unit, benzoyl chloride, has a melting point of 21.0 degrees Celsius. The methoxy groups increase the molecular weight and allow for hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. Each methoxy group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius, giving a total increase of (10 degrees Celsius x 2 methoxy groups) = 20 degrees Celsius.",
