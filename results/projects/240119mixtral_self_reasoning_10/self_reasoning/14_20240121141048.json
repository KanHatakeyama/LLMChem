    "Reason": "1-methylcyclopentene has a basic unit of a cycloalkene, which can be compared to cyclopentene. The melting point of cyclopentene is -130.0\u00b0C. The introduction of a methyl group in 1-methylcyclopentene increases the molecular weight and molecular volume, which can increase the melting point. However, the methyl group also introduces a slight asymmetry in the molecule, which can slightly lower the melting point due to a reduction in molecular symmetry. The net effect of these modifications is a slight increase in the melting point due to the methyl group.",
