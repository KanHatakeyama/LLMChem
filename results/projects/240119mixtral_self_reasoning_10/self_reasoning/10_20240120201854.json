    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole has a pyrrole ring and a phenylsulfonyl group. The basic unit, pyrrole, has a melting point around -20\u00b0C. The phenylsulfonyl group has a melting point around 100\u00b0C due to the presence of a phenyl group and a sulfonyl group. The melting point of the compound is expected to be higher than the basic unit due to the presence of the phenylsulfonyl group. The phenylsulfonyl group has a higher melting point than the pyrrole ring, which has a lower melting point. The melting point of the compound is expected to be around the melting point of the phenylsulfonyl group.",
