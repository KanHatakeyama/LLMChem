    "Reason": "2-Pyridineacetamide has a pyridine ring and an amide group. The basic unit we can compare to is acetamide which has a melting point of around 82 degrees Celsius. The pyridine ring has a basic nitrogen atom which can participate in hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +10 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure. The amide group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, adding around +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure.",
