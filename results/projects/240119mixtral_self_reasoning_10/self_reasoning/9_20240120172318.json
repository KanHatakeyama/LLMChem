    "Reason": "The melting point of N-hexadecane can be estimated by considering the melting points of its lower homologs. The melting point increases with the chain length due to the increase in van der Waals forces. The melting point of N-pentadecane (C15H32) is 18.2\u00b0C, and the melting point of N-heptadecane (C17H36) is 21.6\u00b0C. The melting point increase from pentadecane to heptadecane is 3.4\u00b0C. The melting point of N-hexadecane (C16H34) is expected to be between these two values.",
