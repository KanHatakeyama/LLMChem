    "Reason": "1-fluoropentane is a compound with a pentane backbone and a single fluorine atom. The melting point of pentane is -129.7 degrees Celsius. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and its presence in a molecule increases the melting point due to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Each fluorine atom is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 15 degrees Celsius.",
