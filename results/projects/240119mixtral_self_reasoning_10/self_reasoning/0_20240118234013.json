    "Reason": "4,5-dimethoxy-3-iodobenzaldehyde has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. Starting with the basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C, we have substantial structural components to consider. The presence of the aldehyde group contributes to an increase in the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +20 \u00b0C. The iodine atom is a heavy halogen, and its presence significantly increases the molecular weight and introduces a large dipole, contributing around +50 \u00b0C. The two methoxy groups also increase the melting point due to the additional molecular weight and the capacity for hydrogen bonding, each adding approximately +5 \u00b0C.",
