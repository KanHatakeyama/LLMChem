    "Reason": "4-phenylbenzoic acid has a melting point of 122-123 degrees Celsius. The methyl ester group (\u2013COOCH3) will increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The methyl group will increase the molecular weight and volume, which might minutely raise the melting point. Quantitatively, the methyl ester group can lead to an increase of about +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group's effect might be around +2 degrees Celsius. The effects are additive.",
