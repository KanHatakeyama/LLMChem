    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide is a derivative of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114 \u00b0C. The presence of a chlorine atom in the 3' position and a fluorine atom in the 4' position will both increase the melting point due to their electron-withdrawing nature and the resulting dipole-dipole interactions. The chlorine atom is larger and more electronegative than fluorine, so it will have a more significant effect on the melting point, estimated at +10 \u00b0C for the chlorine atom and +5 \u00b0C for the fluorine atom.",
