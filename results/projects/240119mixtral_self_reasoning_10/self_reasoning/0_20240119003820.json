    "Reason": "Penicillamine is a derivative of the amino acid cysteine, with a thiol group replacing the carboxyl group. The basic unit for this compound is cysteine, which has a melting point around 240\u00b0C. The thiol group in penicillamine is less polar than the carboxyl group in cysteine, which can lead to a decrease in melting point due to weaker intermolecular forces. The thiol group can form hydrogen bonds, but they are generally weaker than those formed by carboxyl groups. The thiol group might lower the melting point by approximately -20\u00b0C.",
