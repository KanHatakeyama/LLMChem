    "Reason": "2-(dimethylamino)ethyl ether has a melting point of -60\u00b0C. The melting point of the bis(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl) ether is expected to be lower than that of the monomer due to the increased molecular weight and the presence of two ether linkages. The ether linkages contribute to a slight increase in melting point due to weak dipole interactions, but the overall effect is dominated by the increased molecular weight and reduced symmetry, which decrease the melting point. The presence of two ether linkages and the increased molecular weight would lower the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C compared to the monomer.",
