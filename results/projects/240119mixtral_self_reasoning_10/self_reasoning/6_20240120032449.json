    "Reason": "5-bromoindole is a derivative of indole, which has a melting point of 52-54\u00b0C. The bromine atom is a heavy halogen atom, which can increase the melting point due to its large size and strong electronegativity. The bromine atom can form stronger intermolecular interactions, such as London dispersion forces, due to its larger size. The bromine atom can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. The bromine atom is expected to increase the melting point by approximately 20-30\u00b0C.",
