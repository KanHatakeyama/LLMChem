    "Reason": "Anthrone is a derivative of benzene with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the benzene ring. The carbonyl group is polar and can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, which increases the melting point. The benzene ring also contributes to the melting point due to its planar structure and pi-pi interactions. The melting point of anthrone can be estimated by comparing it to benzaldehyde, which has a melting point of 9.5 degrees Celsius. The carbonyl group in benzaldehyde increases the melting point by approximately 100 degrees Celsius compared to benzene. Anthrone has a similar carbonyl group, but it is attached to a benzene ring with a fused cyclohexadiene ring, which increases the molecular weight and rigidity. This structural modification can be estimated to add approximately 50 degrees Celsius to the melting point.",
