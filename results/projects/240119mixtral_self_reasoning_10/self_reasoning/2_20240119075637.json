    "Reason": "4-benzyl-3-thiosemicarbazide is a compound with multiple functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit for comparison is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The benzyl group (\u2013CH2C6H5) will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces, but the alkyl chain will slightly lower the melting point due to its flexibility. The thiosemicarbazide group (\u2013NH\u2013C(=S)NH\u2013NH2) will significantly increase the melting point due to its ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular weight. The amide-like structure of the thiosemicarbazide group will also contribute to hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point.",
