    "Reason": "1-aminoanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The anthraquinone moiety is a rigid, planar structure with extensive \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, which can increase the melting point. The carboxylic acid group can form strong hydrogen bonds, further increasing the melting point. The amino group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, but it is less likely to do so due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group in the carboxylic acid. \n\nTo estimate the melting point, we can consider the melting points of the individual functional groups and structural components. Anthraquinone has a melting point of around 200-250\u00b0C, and carboxylic acids typically have a melting point around 200\u00b0C. Amines, on the other hand, have a lower melting point, around 50-100\u00b0C. Considering the melting point contributions from each functional group, we can estimate the overall melting point to be around 250-300\u00b0C.",
