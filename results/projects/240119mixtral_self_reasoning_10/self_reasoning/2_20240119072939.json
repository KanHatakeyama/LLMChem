    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole is a compound with a pyrrole ring and a phenylsulfonyl group. The basic unit we can compare to is pyrrole, which has a melting point of -25.4 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole will affect its melting point: (1) The phenylsulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1)) is a bulky group which could add about +50 due to steric hindrance and increasing the molecular volume; (2) The sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) is a polar group which could add about +20 due to the increase in dipole moment and hydrogen bonding potential; (3) The pyrrole ring (c1ccc(cc1)) is a planar, aromatic ring which could add about +10 due to the increase in molecular rigidity. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
