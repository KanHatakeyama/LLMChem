    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a basic unit of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine atom introduces a halogen atom, which can increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions. The estimated increase due to the chlorine atom is +10\u00b0C. The fluorine atom also introduces a halogen atom, but due to its smaller size, it has a weaker effect than chlorine. The estimated increase due to the fluorine atom is +5\u00b0C. The net increase due to the halogen atoms is +15\u00b0C.",
