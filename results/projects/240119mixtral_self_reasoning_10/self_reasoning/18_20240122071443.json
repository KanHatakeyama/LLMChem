    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a basic unit of acetanilide, which has a melting point of approximately 114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine and fluorine atoms in the ortho and para positions, respectively, can affect the melting point due to the following factors: (1) The halogen atoms increase molecular weight, which can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces; (2) The halogen atoms can participate in halogen bonding, which can increase the melting point due to additional intermolecular interactions; (3) The halogen atoms can affect the crystal lattice due to their size and electronegativity, which can increase the melting point due to stronger crystal packing. The chlorine atom can add approximately +10\u00b0C due to its molecular weight, and the fluorine atom can add approximately +5\u00b0C due to its molecular weight. The halogen bonding and crystal lattice effects can add approximately +10\u00b0C each.",
