    "Reason": "1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole is a compound with a pyrrole ring fused to a phenylsulfonyl group. The pyrrole ring is a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms, one of which is bonded to the phenylsulfonyl group. The phenylsulfonyl group is a phenyl ring bonded to a sulfonyl group (SO2). The melting point of this compound can be estimated by considering the effects of the pyrrole ring and the phenylsulfonyl group.\n\nThe pyrrole ring is a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms. The presence of the nitrogen atoms in the ring makes it polar, which increases the intermolecular forces and the melting point. The melting point of pyrrole is 27.2\u00b0C.\n\nThe phenylsulfonyl group is a phenyl ring bonded to a sulfonyl group (SO2). The sulfonyl group is highly electronegative, which increases the intermolecular forces and the melting point. The melting point of phenylsulfonyl chloride, a related compound, is 58\u00b0C.\n\nThe melting point of 1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole can be estimated by adding the effects of the pyrrole ring and the phenylsulfonyl group. The estimated melting point is 85.2\u00b0C.",
