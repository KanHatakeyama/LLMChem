    "Reason": "4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid is a derivative of cyclohexene, which has a melting point of -48.5\u00b0C. The introduction of two carboxylic acid groups significantly increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +100\u00b0C each. The cis configuration introduces a more rigid structure, but also reduces the symmetry. This reduction in symmetry and presence of strain usually leads to a higher melting point. However, the exact impact of cis configuration is difficult to quantify without experimental data or detailed computational studies. Cis configuration: +10\u00b0C (This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the exact value for such structural modifications).",
