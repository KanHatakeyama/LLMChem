    "Reason": "2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile has a basic unit of benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a nitrile group increases the melting point due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds and the rigidity it introduces. The trifluoromethyl group also increases the melting point due to the molecular weight and the electronegative fluorine atoms, which can form weak dipole interactions. The nitrile group can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C, and the trifluoromethyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
