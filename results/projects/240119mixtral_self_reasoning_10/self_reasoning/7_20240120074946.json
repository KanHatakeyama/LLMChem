    "Reason": "6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one is a compound with several functional groups. The basic unit we can compare to is indole, which has a melting point of around 52 degrees Celsius. The additional functional groups and structural features in 6-nitro-2-phenyl-3H-indol-3-one will affect its melting point: (1) The phenyl group (c2cccc2) is a large aromatic group which could add approximately +20 due to the increase in molecular weight and rigidity of the structure; (2) The nitro group (N=C(c3ccccc3)C2=O) is a strong withdrawing group that introduces a significant dipole, increasing intermolecular forces and melting point by approximately +50; (3) The ketone group (O=[N+]([O-])) increases the melting point due to polar carbonyl interactions, contributing approximately +40. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
