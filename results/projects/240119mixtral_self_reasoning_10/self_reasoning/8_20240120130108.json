    "Reason": "4-chloro-2-methylanisole is a derivative of anisole, which has a melting point of -6.0\u00b0C. The introduction of a chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and introduces a polar halogen atom, which can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. The methyl group increases the molecular weight and size, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
