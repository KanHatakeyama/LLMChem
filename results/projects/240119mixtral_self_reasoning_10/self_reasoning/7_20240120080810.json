    "Reason": "The melting point of linuron, a pesticide, can be estimated by comparing it to a similar compound, chlorothalonil, which has a melting point of 104.5\u00b0C. The structural differences between linuron and chlorothalonil are: (1) The presence of a urea group (NC(=O)N(C)OC) in linuron, which can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding, adding approximately +20\u00b0C; (2) The absence of a benzene ring in linuron, which can decrease the melting point due to the loss of aromatic interactions, reducing it by approximately -10\u00b0C. Summing these modifications gives us an estimated melting point shift.",
