    "Reason": "4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine contains a chlorophenyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a piperidine ring. The chlorophenyl group increases the molecular weight and introduces a dipole, which raises the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C. However, the piperidine ring is a saturated cyclic structure, which tends to lower the melting point compared to an aromatic ring. This effect might decrease the melting point by approximately -20\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Chlorophenyl (+50\u00b0C), hydroxyl (+20\u00b0C), and piperidine (-20\u00b0C).",
