    "Reason": "1,2-benzenediol (catechol) is a suitable basic unit for comparison, with a melting point of 105.6\u00b0C. The anthrone molecule has a fused benzene ring and a carbonyl group (C=O) compared to catechol. The fused benzene ring increases the molecular weight and rigidity, which generally raises the melting point. The carbonyl group (C=O) can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, further increasing the melting point. The net effect of these structural modifications is a higher melting point compared to catechol.",
