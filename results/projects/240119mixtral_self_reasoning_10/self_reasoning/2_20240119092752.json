    "Reason": "4-hydroxypiperidine has a melting point of 110-111\u00b0C. The presence of a 4-chlorophenyl group will increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and van der Waals forces. The chlorine atom is also electronegative, which leads to stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. The chlorophenyl group is estimated to increase the melting point by approximately 10-15 degrees Celsius.",
