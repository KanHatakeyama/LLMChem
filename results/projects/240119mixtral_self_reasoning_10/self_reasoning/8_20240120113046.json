    "Reason": "2-Pyridinecarboxamide, 3-hydroxy- has a pyridine ring as its basic unit, which has a melting point around -42\u00b0C. The presence of a carboxamide group generally increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, which can raise it by approximately +100\u00b0C. The hydroxy group also contributes to the melting point increase due to hydrogen bonding, which can add around +20\u00b0C. Summing up these changes: Pyridine base (-42\u00b0C), carboxamide group (+100\u00b0C), and hydroxy group (+20\u00b0C).",
