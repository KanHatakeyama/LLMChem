    "Reason": "4-Cyanophenol has a melting point of 102-103\u00b0C. The basic unit for comparison is phenol, which has a melting point around 43\u00b0C. The introduction of the cyano group (\u2013CN) increases the molecular weight and introduces a strong dipole, which increases the melting point due to the enhancement of intermolecular forces. The cyano group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. Taking the effect of the cyano group into consideration, we can predict a net increase due to molecular size, dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding.",
