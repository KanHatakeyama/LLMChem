    "Reason": "2-pyridineacetamide is a derivative of acetamide, which has a melting point of 82\u00b0C. The pyridine ring in 2-pyridineacetamide is a planar aromatic ring that can participate in pi-pi stacking interactions, increasing the melting point. However, the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring is less electronegative than oxygen, which may slightly reduce the hydrogen bonding capability of the amide group. The overall effect of the pyridine ring is an increase in the melting point due to the enhanced pi-pi stacking interactions. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring may also form hydrogen bonds with the amide group, further increasing the melting point. Considering these factors, the melting point of 2-pyridineacetamide is expected to be higher than that of acetamide.",
