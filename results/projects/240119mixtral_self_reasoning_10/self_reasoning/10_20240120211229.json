    "Reason": "3-hydroxy-4-iodobenzoic acid has a carboxylic acid group, a hydroxy group, and an iodine atom. The carboxylic acid group has a strong hydrogen bonding potential, which can increase the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C. The hydroxy group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, but its effect is less than the carboxylic acid group, contributing around +10\u00b0C. The iodine atom increases the molecular weight and size, which can raise the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C.",
