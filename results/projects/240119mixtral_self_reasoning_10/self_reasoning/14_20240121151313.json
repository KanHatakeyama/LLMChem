    "Reason": "2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid has a basic unit, cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, which has a melting point around 40 degrees Celsius. The 2,2-dimethyl group increases the molecular volume and introduces a more rigid structure, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group attached to the carboxylic acid can increase the melting point by approximately +5 degrees Celsius due to the increase in molecular volume and potential hydrogen bonding.",
