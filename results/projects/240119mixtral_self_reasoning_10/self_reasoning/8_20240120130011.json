    "Reason": "1-aminoanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid has several functional groups that can influence its melting point. The basic unit is the anthraquinone moiety, which has a melting point of 286 \u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) increases the melting point due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds. The amino group (-NH2) also increases the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. However, the amino group can also disrupt the packing of the crystal lattice due to its ability to rotate, which can slightly lower the melting point. The net effect of the amino and carboxylic acid groups is an increase in the melting point.",
