    "Reason": "3'-chloro-4'-fluoroacetanilide has a basic unit of acetanilide, which has a melting point of 113-114\u00b0C. The presence of the chlorine atom in the 3'-position and the fluorine atom in the 4'-position can be estimated to increase the melting point due to the enhancement of the crystalline structure and the increase in molecular weight. The chlorine atom can add approximately +10\u00b0C due to its size and electronegativity, while the fluorine atom can add approximately +5\u00b0C due to its smaller size and electronegativity. The total estimated increase in melting point is +15\u00b0C.",
