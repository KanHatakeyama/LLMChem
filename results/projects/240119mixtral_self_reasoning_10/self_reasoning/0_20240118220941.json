    "Reason": "2-(dimethylamino)ethyl ether has a melting point of -70 degrees Celsius. The compound bis(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl) ether is formed by connecting two 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl ether molecules through an ether linkage. The ether linkage is expected to increase the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and the potential for hydrogen bonding. However, the presence of two amino groups (-N(C)C) in the compound can also lower the melting point due to the increased potential for hydrogen bonding. The net effect of these modifications is expected to be a slightly higher melting point than the original compound.",
