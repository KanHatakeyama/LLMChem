    "Reason": "1-aminoanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid is a derivative of anthraquinone, which has a melting point of 286\u00b0C. The presence of the amino group (-NH2) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional groups will affect the melting point. The amino group can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C. The carboxylic acid group can also form hydrogen bonds, but it is more likely to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which can reduce the melting point by approximately -10\u00b0C. The net effect of these modifications is a slight increase in the melting point.",
