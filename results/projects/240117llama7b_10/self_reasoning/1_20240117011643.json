    "Reason": "The compound has a pyrazole ring, which has a melting point of around 120 degrees Celsius. The nitro functional group raises the melting point due to its electron-withdrawing nature, which increases the intermolecular interactions. The methyl group attached to the nitro functional group also increases the melting point due to its bulkiness and steric hindrance. The carboxylic acid group also raises the melting point due to its polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities. The sulfur atom in the sulfide group can also contribute to the melting point due to its high electronegativity and ability to participate in \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking.",
