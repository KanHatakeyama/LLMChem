    "Reason": "The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule can increase the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and rigidity of the molecule. The methyl group attached to the phenyl ring can also contribute to the melting point due to its bulkiness and increased molecular weight. The phenyl group itself has a melting point of around 41\u00b0C, which is significantly altered by the presence of the carbonyl group. The carbonyl group can increase the melting point by +50\u00b0C, due to its rigidity and planarity. The methyl group can contribute +20\u00b0C to the melting point due to its bulkiness. Summing these contributions, the predicted increase over the base value of phenol would be +50\u00b0C (carbonyl group) + 20\u00b0C (methyl group), amounting to a +70\u00b0C increase.",
