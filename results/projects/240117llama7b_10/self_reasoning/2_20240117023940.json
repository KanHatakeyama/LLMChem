    "Reason": "The compound (2E)-2-phenyl-3-(phenylamino)prop-2-enenitrile has a base structure of a prop-2-enenitrile group, which has a melting point of approximately -20\u00b0C. The phenylamino group attached to the alpha carbon adds a further +60\u00b0C due to its increased molecular weight and pi-pi stacking interactions. The phenyl group adds an additional +60\u00b0C due to its increased molecular weight and pi-pi stacking interactions. The total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -20 (base) + 60 (phenylamino group) + 60 (phenyl group) = 140\u00b0C.",
