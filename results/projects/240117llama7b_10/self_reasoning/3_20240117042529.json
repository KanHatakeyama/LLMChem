    "Reason": "The compound 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) has a base structure of aniline, which has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and polarity. The chlorine atoms also participate in intermolecular interactions such as London dispersion forces. Additionally, the electron-withdrawing nature of the chlorine atoms may help stabilize the charge distribution in the molecule. The estimated increase in melting point due to the chlorine atoms is around +50 to +70 degrees Celsius.",
