    "Reason": "- The presence of a large aromatic ring system (phenyl) and a methyl group attached to the ring, which can increase the molecular weight and therefore the melting point.\n- The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which can form hydrogen bonds and increase the polarity of the molecule, leading to a higher melting point.\n- The presence of a sulfur atom, which can form covalent bonds with other molecules and increase the molecular weight, leading to a higher melting point.\n- The presence of a fluorine atom, which can increase the molecular weight and polarity of the molecule, leading to a higher melting point.\n- The presence of a methyl group attached to the phenyl ring, which can increase the molecular weight and polarity of the molecule, leading to a higher melting point.\n- The presence of a nitro functional group, which can increase the polarity of the molecule and lead to a higher melting point.\nBased on these considerations, a rough estimate for the melting point of leflunomide would be around 150-160 degrees Celsius.",
