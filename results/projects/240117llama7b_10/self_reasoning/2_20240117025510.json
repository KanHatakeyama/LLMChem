    "Reason": "The base unit of thiophene has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group typically contributes to a decrease in melting point due to less symmetry and weaker intermolecular forces, like hydrogen bonding, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -20 to -40\u00b0C. The chlorine atom adds to the molecular weight and steric bulk, which can increase the melting point by +50 to +100\u00b0C.",
