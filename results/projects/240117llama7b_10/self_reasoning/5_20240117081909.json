    "Reason": "Aconine has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that contribute to its melting point. The base unit, a 24-carbon chain, contributes a melting point of around 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group adds a significant increase in melting point due to its polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. The carbonyl group also contributes to the melting point due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The methyl group attached to the nitro group may also contribute to the melting point due to its small size and increased molecular weight. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and a conjugated double bond within the molecule also contribute to the melting point due to their rigidity and potential for pi-pi stacking. The overall effect of these functional groups is a significant increase in melting point, estimated to be around +150 degrees Celsius.",
