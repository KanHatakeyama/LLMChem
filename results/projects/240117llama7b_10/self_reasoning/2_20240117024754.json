    "Reason": "The compound benzenecarbothioamide, n-phenyl- has a melting point of 115 degrees Celsius. The presence of a benzene ring and a carbothioamide group contribute to the melting point, with the benzene ring increasing the melting point by 5 degrees Celsius and the carbothioamide group increasing it by 80 degrees Celsius. The presence of a phenyl group also contributes to the melting point, with an estimated increase of 10 degrees Celsius.",
