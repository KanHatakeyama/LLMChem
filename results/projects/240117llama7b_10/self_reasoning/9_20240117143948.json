    "Reason": "The compound 3,5-dichlorophenylhydrazine has a high melting point due to its molecular structure. The presence of a phenyl group, which typically has a melting point of around 41\u00b0C, is significantly altered by the addition of a chlorine atom, which can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. The presence of two chlorine atoms can contribute to a higher melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance. The hydrazine group can also contribute to the melting point due to its potential for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity. A rough estimate for the contribution of each chlorine atom could be +20 degrees, and the hydrazine group could contribute +20 degrees as well. The presence of two chlorine atoms and a hydrazine group can contribute to a higher melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance.",
