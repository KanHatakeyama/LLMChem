    "Reason": "The base compound quinoline has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. Methylation of the quinoline base can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and increased intermolecular interactions such as London dispersion forces. A rough estimate for the effect of a single methyl group might be around +20 degrees.",
