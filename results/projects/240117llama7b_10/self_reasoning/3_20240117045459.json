    "Reason": "Secobarbital is a barbituric acid derivative with a melting point of 120\u00b0C. The barbituric acid group itself contributes to a melting point increase of +40\u00b0C due to its rigidity and polarity. The methyl group attached to the nitrogen atom adds +5\u00b0C due to increased van der Waals interactions. The nitro group contributes +30\u00b0C due to its electronegative nature and ability to participate in hydrogen bonding. The presence of two methyl groups on the phenyl ring adds +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The conjugated double bond within the phenyl ring contributes +10\u00b0C due to increased conjugation and aromaticity. Finally, the presence of a hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring adds +5\u00b0C due to increased hydrogen bonding capability.",
