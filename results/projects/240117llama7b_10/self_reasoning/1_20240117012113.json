    "Reason": "- Chlorine is a halogen atom, which is known to increase the melting point of a compound. We can estimate an increase of approximately +60\u00b0C.\n- Thiophene is a planar, aromatic ring with a high degree of conjugation, which can contribute to a higher melting point. Estimate an increase of approximately +40\u00b0C.\n- Carboxylic acid functional group: Carboxylic acids are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, thus increasing the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +30\u00b0C.",
