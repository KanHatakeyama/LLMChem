    "Reason": "The compound has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that contribute to its melting point:\n- Benzene ring: The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- Thiourea group: Thioureas typically raise the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and polarity. A rough estimate for its contribution could be +50 degrees.\n- Methyl groups: Methyl groups increase the molecular weight leading to higher melting points, although the contribution is typically small. Estimated contribution might be +5 degrees.\n- Bicyclic ring: Bicyclic rings generally increase the melting point due to increased steric hindrance and rigidity. An estimated contribution might be +50 degrees.\n- Cumulative impact: The individual contributions of each group can be summed up, but it's also necessary to consider that the presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 5.5 (for the benzene rings) + 50 (for the thiourea group) + 5 (for the methyl groups) + 50 (for the bicyclic ring) = 110 degrees Celsius. Adding a consideration for synergistic effects, a more refined estimate taking into account the cumulative polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups might be approximated as +80 degrees, leading to a predicted melting point of 190 degrees Celsius.",
