    "Reason": "The compound 3-[(E)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)vinyl]-2-methyl-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-indole has a high melting point due to its molecular structure. The presence of a phenyl group, which typically has a melting point of around 41\u00b0C, is significantly altered by the addition of other functional groups and structural features. The vinyl group, which can contribute to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, tends to increase the melting point, estimated to contribute +50\u00b0C. The presence of a phenyl sulfonyl group, which can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding, estimated to contribute +30\u00b0C. The two chlorine atoms attached to the phenyl group can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding, estimated to contribute +20\u00b0C each. The methyl group attached to the indole base can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance, estimated to contribute +10\u00b0C. The presence of a double bond in the vinyl group can also contribute to the melting point, estimated to contribute +10\u00b0C. Summing these contributions, the predicted increase over the base value of phenol would be +50\u00b0C (vinyl group) + +30\u00b0C (phenyl sulfonyl group) + +20\u00b0C (each chlorine group) + +10\u00b0C (methyl group) + +10\u00b0C (double bond in vinyl group), amounting to a +110\u00b0C increase.",
