    "Reason": "The base compound 2-chloroaniline has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methylene groups and a second chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and introduces additional intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and London dispersion forces. The methylene groups contribute to rigidity and increase the melting point, while the second chlorine atom adds polarity and further increases intermolecular interactions. The estimated increase for each methylene group is +10 degrees Celsius, and the second chlorine atom contributes +50 degrees Celsius.",
