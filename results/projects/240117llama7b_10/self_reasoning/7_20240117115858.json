    "Reason": "The compound has a melting point due to its molecular structure. The benzene ring has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of the boc group (4-boc-piperazine) typically raises the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. A rough estimate for its contribution could be +20 degrees. The piperazine ring contributes to an increase in melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding capability. The methyl group attached to the piperazine can raise the melting point by about 5 degrees. Taken together, the net effect of the functional groups could be estimated to increase the melting point by 70 to 120 degrees.",
