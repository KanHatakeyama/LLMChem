    "Reason": "The compound maprotiline has a structure composed of a phenyl group, a benzene ring, and a tertiary amino group. The phenyl group contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and increased polarity, with a rough estimate of +50 degrees Celsius. The benzene ring has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The tertiary amino group can increase the melting point due to its nitrogen atom, which introduces both inductive and resonance stabilization that increases intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. The presence of multiple polar functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.",
