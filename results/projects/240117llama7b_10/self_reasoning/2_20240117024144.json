    "Reason": "The sulfonamide group is a polar functional group that can increase the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding and polarity. The presence of a chlorine atom on the benzene ring also contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and polarity. The phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its planarity and increased molecular weight. The chlorine atom on the phenyl group can also increase the melting point due to increased polarity.",
