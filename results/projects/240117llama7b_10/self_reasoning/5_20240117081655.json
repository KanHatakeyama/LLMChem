    "Reason": "The presence of a fluorine atom increases the melting point due to its high electronegativity and increased polarizability, which can lead to increased intermolecular interactions and rigidity. The chlorine atom also contributes to the melting point due to its electronegativity and increased polarizability. The purine ring itself has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to its planarity and rigidity. The fluorine and chlorine atoms contribute to the melting point through increased polarizability and electronegativity, estimated at +50\u00b0C and +20\u00b0C, respectively.",
