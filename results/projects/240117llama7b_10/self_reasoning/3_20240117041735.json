    "Reason": "The compound cyclohexanol, 4-chloro-, trans- has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C due to the presence of a benzene ring. The chlorine atom attached to the benzene ring can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C due to increased polarity and intermolecular interactions. The cyclohexyl group, which is a rigid and planar structure, can contribute to an increase in melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased hydrogen bonding capability. The trans-configuration can contribute to a slight increase in melting point due to increased steric hindrance and planarity.",
