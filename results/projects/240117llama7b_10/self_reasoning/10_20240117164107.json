    "Reason": "The base compound 2-chloroaniline has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The presence of two chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and introduces polar functional groups, which can participate in intermolecular interactions such as London dispersion forces. The methylene bridge adds rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The estimated increase for each chlorine atom is around +50 degrees Celsius. The methylene bridge adds +10 degrees.",
