    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of benzoic acid, 2-hydroxy-, 2-hydroxyethyl ester, we consider the known melting point influence of various functional groups relative to benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The hydroxyl group in the benzoic acid contributes to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, estimated to increase the melting point by +5\u00b0C. The presence of an ethyl group in the ester functional group can also contribute to van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The aromatic ring structure in the molecule tends to stabilize it, but considering the complexity of the molecule and the presence of multiple functional groups that generally increase the melting point, the effect of aromaticity might be comparatively minimal, estimated at -5\u00b0C overall. Therefore, we calculate as follows: Benzene (5.5) + Hydroxyl group (5) + Ester group (5) + Aromaticity (5) = 5.5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16.5\u00b0C",
