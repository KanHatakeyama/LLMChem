    "Reason": "The presence of a cyclohexyl group in the molecule can contribute to a higher melting point due to its rigidity and increased molecular weight. The cyclohexyl group can contribute a +50\u00b0C increase to the melting point. The carboxylic acid functional group typically contributes to a decrease in melting point compared to the parent compound due to less symmetry and weaker intermolecular forces, like hydrogen bonding, which might decrease the melting point by approximately -20 to -40\u00b0C.",
