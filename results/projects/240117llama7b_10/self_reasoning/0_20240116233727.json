    "Reason": "The molecule has a basic structure of an indole ring with a phenyl group attached through a vinyl linkage, a 2,4-dichlorophenyl group, and a sulfonyl group. The indole ring itself has a melting point of around -10\u00b0C, while the phenyl group contributes to a higher melting point due to its planarity and increased electron density. The vinyl group and the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group are less rigid and contribute to a lower melting point due to their flexibility. The sulfonyl group is polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point. The total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -10 (base) + 20 (phenyl group) + 40 (vinyl group) + 50 (2,4-dichlorophenyl group) + 20 (sulfonyl group) = 130\u00b0C.",
