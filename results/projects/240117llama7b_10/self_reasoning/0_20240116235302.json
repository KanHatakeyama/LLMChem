    "Reason": "The compound in question contains a benzene ring, a nitro functional group, and a hydroxyl group. The benzene ring has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C, while the nitro group typically raises the melting point by around 30-40\u00b0C due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. The hydroxyl group can also contribute to an increase in melting point due to hydrogen bonding, although the exact contribution depends on the position of the hydroxyl group on the molecule. In this case, the hydroxyl group is located on the 5-position of the benzene ring, which can contribute to a higher melting point due to increased steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding. A rough estimate for the contribution of the hydroxyl group could be around 50-80\u00b0C.\nTaking into account the individual contributions of each functional group and considering the cumulative effect of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule, a rough estimate for the melting point of the compound would be around 130-150\u00b0C.",
