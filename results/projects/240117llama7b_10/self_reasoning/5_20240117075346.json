    "Reason": "The base compound 2-chloroaniline has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methylene groups and a second chlorine atom increases the molecular weight and introduces additional intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and London dispersion forces. The methylene groups contribute to the rigidity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point. The second chlorine atom also contributes to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and polarity. The estimated increase for each methylene group is around +20 degrees Celsius, and the second chlorine atom contributes around +50 degrees Celsius.",
