    "Reason": "The compound 6-chloro-2-fluoropurine has a melting point that is influenced by several factors:\n- Chlorine atom: Chlorine atoms typically increase the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be +50 degrees.\n- Fluorine atom: Fluorine atoms also increase the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be +60 degrees.\n- Purine ring: The base unit purine has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius.\n- Chlorine and fluorine groups: The presence of both chlorine and fluorine groups can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be +30 degrees.",
