    "Reason": "The presence of a phenyl group in the molecule can contribute to a higher melting point due to its rigidity and planarity, which can increase the intermolecular interactions and hydrogen bonding capabilities. The chlorine atoms can also contribute to a higher melting point due to their electronegativity and increased molecular weight. The hydrazine group can also contribute to a higher melting point due to its potential for hydrogen bonding and increased molecular weight. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms can increase the melting point due to increased intermolecular interactions and increased molecular weight.",
