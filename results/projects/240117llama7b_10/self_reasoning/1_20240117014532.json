    "Reason": "The molecule, 6,6-dimethyl-5,7-dioxaspiro[2.5]octane-4,8-dione, has a base melting point of -40 degrees Celsius. The methyl groups add steric bulk and increase molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point. The dioxaspiro ring system has a higher degree of conjugation than a benzene ring, which can contribute to a higher melting point. The carbonyl group on the dioxaspiro ring can form hydrogen bonds, which can also increase the melting point. The total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -40 (base) + 20 (dimethyl groups) + 40 (dioxaspiro ring) + 5 (carbonyl group) = 85\u00b0C.",
