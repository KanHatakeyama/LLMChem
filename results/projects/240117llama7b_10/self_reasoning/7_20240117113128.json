    "Reason": "The base unit of carbonic acid, a simple hydrocarbon, has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a phenyl group in the ester functional group can contribute to a higher melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for pi-pi stacking. Each phenyl group can add roughly +20 to +30\u00b0C to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for pi-pi stacking. The presence of two phenyl groups can contribute to a synergistic effect, potentially raising the melting point by +40 to +60\u00b0C.",
