    "Reason": "The compound 2,2,2-trichloro-1-ethoxyethanol has a melting point that is influenced by several factors. The base structure of ethanol has a melting point of -11.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of three chlorine atoms adds to the molecular weight and polarity, which can increase the melting point. Each chlorine atom contributes to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and polarity. The ethoxy group adds bulkiness and steric hindrance, which can also increase the melting point. The estimated contribution for each chlorine atom is +50 degrees Celsius. The ethoxy group contributes +20 degrees Celsius. The total estimated increase in melting point is: -11.5 (base) + 50 (chlorine atoms) + 20 (ethoxy group) = 61.5 degrees Celsius.",
