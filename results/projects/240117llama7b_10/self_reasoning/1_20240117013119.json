    "Reason": "Aconine has a complex molecular structure with multiple functional groups and structural features that contribute to its high melting point. The presence of a nitro functional group, which is known to increase the melting point due to its electron-withdrawing nature, is estimated to contribute +30\u00b0C to the melting point. The aromatic ring system, which is planar and rigid, contributes to the molecule's high melting point through increased intermolecular interactions, estimated at +40\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group on the nitro functional group may also contribute to the melting point, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The remaining functional groups, such as the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, are expected to have a smaller effect on the melting point, estimated at +5\u00b0C each.",
