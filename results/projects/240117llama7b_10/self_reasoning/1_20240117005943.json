    "Reason": "- The presence of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. Estimated contribution is +50 degrees.\n- The cyclohexane ring provides rigidity and planarity, which can increase the melting point. Estimated contribution is +30 degrees.\n- The trans configuration adds a small degree of stereochemical rigidity, estimated at +5 degrees.\n- The molecule's low molecular weight and simple structure contribute to a lower melting point compared to larger or more complex molecules. Estimated contribution is -10 degrees.\nBased on these considerations, a rough estimate for the melting point of cyclohexanol, 4-chloro-, trans- would be 50 (for the chlorine atom) + 30 (for the cyclohexane ring) + 5 (for the trans configuration) - 10 (for the low molecular weight) = 95 degrees Celsius.",
