    "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by various factors such as the molecular weight, symmetry, intermolecular forces, and polarity. The presence of a fluorine atom can increase the melting point due to its high electronegativity and ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions. The chlorine atom adds to the molecular weight and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also increase the melting point. The purine ring itself has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C. The fluorine atom adds a significant increase to the melting point due to its high electronegativity and ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions. The chlorine atom adds to the molecular weight and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also increase the melting point. The presence of a fluorine atom can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C, and the chlorine atom can contribute +20\u00b0C due to its increased molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding.",
