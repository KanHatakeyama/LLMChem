    "Reason": "- Benzene: The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- Nitro group: The nitro functional group can increase the melting point due to increased electronegativity and the capability for intermolecular interactions, estimated at +30 degrees.\n- Chlorine atoms: Chlorine atoms are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by +5 to +10 degrees.\n- Conjugation: The presence of a conjugated double bond within the molecule can contribute to increased rigidity and potentially higher melting point, estimated at +5 to +10 degrees.\n\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 5.5 (for the benzene rings) + 30 (for the nitro group) + 5 (for each chlorine atom) + 5 to 10 (for conjugation) = 90.5 degrees Celsius.",
