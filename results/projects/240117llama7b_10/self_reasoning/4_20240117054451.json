    "Reason": "- Benzoic acid: Benzoic acid has a melting point of 12.5\u00b0C due to its rigid ring structure and the presence of a carboxyl group, which can participate in hydrogen bonding.\n- Hydroxyl groups: Two hydroxyl groups capable of hydrogen bonding. Estimated to increase melting point by +5 per OH group for a total of +10.\n- Ester functionalities: Two ester functionalities contribute to melting point elevation through dipole-dipole interactions. Estimated at +5 per group, giving an increase of +10.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
