    "Reason": "The base compound quinoline has a melting point of -10 degrees Celsius. Methylation of the quinoline base can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and increased intermolecular interactions. The methyl group itself does not significantly contribute to the melting point, but it can increase the molecular weight and potentially participate in hydrogen bonding. A rough estimate for the effect of methylation could be around +20 degrees.",
