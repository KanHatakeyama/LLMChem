    "Reason": "The compound gestonorone caproate has a complex structure composed of a phenyl group, a furan ring, a methylene bridge, and a caproic acid group. Each functional group can contribute to the melting point in different ways:\n- Phenyl group: A single phenyl group usually raises the melting point of a compound due to its pi-pi stacking interactions and increased molecular complexity. Estimate an increase of approximately +60\u00b0C.\n- Furan ring: Heteroaromatic rings can have variable effects on melting point, depending on the substitution pattern. For this case, considering the conjugation and additional ring, we might estimate an increase of about +40\u00b0C.\n- Methylene bridge: Being a small linker, its influence is small. However, it adds rigidity to the molecule, so we can estimate a small increase of +5\u00b0C.\n- Caproic acid group: Carboxylic acids typically raise the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased polarity. A rough estimate for their contribution could be +50 degrees.",
