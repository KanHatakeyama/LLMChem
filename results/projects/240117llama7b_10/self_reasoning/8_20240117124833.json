    "Reason": "The presence of a phenyl group in the molecule can contribute to a higher melting point due to increased rigidity and planarity. The presence of a chlorine atom on the phenyl ring can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and increased intermolecular interactions. The hydrazine group can also contribute to a higher melting point due to increased polarity and increased hydrogen bonding capability. The presence of a nitrogen atom can also increase the melting point due to increased polarity and increased hydrogen bonding capability.",
