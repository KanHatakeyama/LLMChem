    "Reason": "Benzaldehyde contributes a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of the azide group can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. An estimated contribution could be around 20-30 degrees. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms within the azine ring can also contribute to increased melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. An estimated contribution could be around 10-20 degrees.",
