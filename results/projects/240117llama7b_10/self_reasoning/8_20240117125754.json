    "Reason": "The compound cyclohexanol, 4-chloro-, trans- has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The cyclohexane ring itself has a melting point of around 5.5\u00b0C. The chlorine atom attached to the ring can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and intermolecular interactions, estimated to contribute +50\u00b0C. The presence of a trans configuration can also contribute to a higher melting point due to increased steric hindrance and planarity, estimated to contribute +20\u00b0C.",
