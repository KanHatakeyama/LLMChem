    "Reason": "The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule can increase the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and the increased polarity of the molecule. The methyl group attached to the phenyl ring can also increase the melting point due to its bulkiness and increased steric hindrance. The phenyl group itself can also contribute to the melting point due to its planarity and increased polarity. The presence of a carbonyl group and a methyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +50\u00b0C and +20\u00b0C, respectively. The phenyl group can contribute an estimated +40\u00b0C to the melting point. Summing these contributions, the predicted increase over the base value of phenol would be +50\u00b0C (carbonyl group) + +20\u00b0C (methyl group) + +40\u00b0C (phenyl group), amounting to a +110\u00b0C increase.",
