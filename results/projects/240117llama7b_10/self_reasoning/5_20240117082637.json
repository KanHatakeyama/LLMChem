    "Reason": "The base compound furan has a melting point of around -12 degrees Celsius. The bromine substituent increases the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and polarity. The furan ring itself contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and increased polarity. The presence of a methyl group on the alpha carbon can also contribute to the melting point due to increased steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding potential. The bromine on the alpha carbon can also increase the melting point due to increased polarity and electronegativity. The overall effect of the bromine on the melting point is estimated to be around +70 degrees Celsius.",
