    "Reason": "- Benzene ring: The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- Phenyl group: The presence of a phenyl group increases the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. Estimated contribution could be +30 degrees.\n- Amino group: Amines typically raise the melting point due to strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stability. This can be estimated to contribute about +80 degrees.\n- Nitrile group: Nitriles generally lower the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be -30 degrees.\n- Cumulative impact: The individual contributions of each group can be summed up, but it's also necessary to consider that the presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 5.5 (for the benzene rings) + 30 (for the phenyl group) + 80 (for the amino group) - 30 (for the nitrile group) = 105 degrees Celsius. Adding a consideration for synergistic effects, a more refined estimate taking into account the cumulative polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups might be approximated as +80 degrees, leading to a predicted melting point of 185 degrees Celsius.",
