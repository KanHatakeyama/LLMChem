    "Reason": "The compound sulfamoxole has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule introduces additional steric hindrance and electronegativity, which can increase the melting point. The aromatic ring also contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point. The sulfonamide group (-N=C=O) is polar and hydrogen bonding, which can also increase the melting point. The overall effect of these functional groups is a +100 degrees Celsius increase in the melting point.",
