    "Reason": "- Benzene ring: The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- Alkyl groups: The presence of tert-butyl groups increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance. An estimated contribution could be +50 degrees.\n- Hydroxyl group: Hydroxyl groups contribute to the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be +50 degrees.\n- Azide group: Azides are known to increase the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be +50 degrees.\n- Cumulative impact: The individual contributions of each group can be summed up, but it's also necessary to consider that the presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 5.5 (for the benzene rings) + 50 (for the alkyl groups) + 50 (for the hydroxyl group) + 50 (for the azide group) = 195 degrees Celsius. Adding a consideration for synergistic effects, a more refined estimate taking into account the cumulative polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups might be approximated as +80 degrees, leading to a predicted melting point of 275 degrees Celsius.",
