    "Reason": "The compound 6-nitro-1H-indazole has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups. The indazole base has a melting point of around 105\u00b0C. The nitro group raises the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. An estimated contribution for the nitro group might be +50\u00b0C. The presence of a benzene ring in the indazole base also contributes to the melting point, with a rough estimate of +50\u00b0C. The overall effect of the indazole base can be considered as a baseline, which is increased by the nitro group.",
