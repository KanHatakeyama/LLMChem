    "Reason": "The melting point of 6-nitro-1H-indazole can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The nitro group, which is a polar and electronegative functional group, can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased polarity. An estimated contribution of +50 degrees can be attributed to the nitro group. The indazole ring itself has a melting point of around 100 degrees Celsius due to its planarity and rigidity. The presence of a methyl group attached to the nitro group can increase the melting point due to steric hindrance and increased molecular weight. An estimated contribution of +10 degrees can be attributed to the methyl group.",
