    "Reason": "The compound 2-amino-6-fluoropyridine has a pyridine ring, which has a melting point of approximately -10\u00b0C. The fluorine atom attached to the pyridine ring increases the polarity of the molecule and raises the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding. The amino group adds additional electronegativity and steric bulk, which also raises the melting point. The estimated increase in melting point due to the fluorine atom is approximately +40\u00b0C, and the amino group adds +20\u00b0C.",
