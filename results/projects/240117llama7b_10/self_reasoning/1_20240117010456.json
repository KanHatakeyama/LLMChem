    "Reason": "The presence of a sulfonamide group in the molecule increases the molecular weight and introduces a polar functional group capable of forming hydrogen bonds. The aromatic ring also contributes to the molecular weight and rigidity. The chlorine substituent increases the molecular weight and introduces a polar functional group capable of forming ionic interactions. The phenyl group also contributes to the molecular weight and rigidity.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
