    "Reason": "Aconine is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, including a large aromatic ring, a nitro functional group, and a carbonyl group. Each of these groups can contribute to the melting point of the molecule.\n\n- Aromatic ring: Aromatic rings are known to increase the melting point due to their planarity and the ability of the electrons to delocalize and participate in \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. We can estimate an increase of approximately +20\u00b0C for the aromatic ring.\n- Nitro functional group: Nitro functional groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. Estimate an increase of approximately +10\u00b0C.\n- Carbonyl group: Carbonyl groups are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point. Estimate an increase of approximately +10\u00b0C.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
