    "Reason": "The compound has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that contribute to its melting point:\n\n- Benzene ring: The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- Thiourea group: Thioureas typically have a melting point increase of around 50 degrees due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding.\n- Bicyclic ring: The bicyclic ring system adds rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, estimated to increase melting point by +40.\n- Methyl groups: The three methyl groups contribute to the molecular weight, leading to a higher melting point. Estimated contribution might be +15 degrees.\n- Cumulative impact: The individual contributions of each group can be summed up, but it's also necessary to consider that the presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 5.5 (for the benzene rings) + 50 (for the thiourea group) + 40 (for the bicyclic ring) + 15 (for the methyl groups) = 110 degrees Celsius. Adding a consideration for synergistic effects, a more refined estimate taking into account the cumulative polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups might be approximated as +80 degrees, leading to a predicted melting point of 190 degrees Celsius.",
