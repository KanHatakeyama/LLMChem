    "Reason": "- Benzene ring: The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- Fused aromatic rings: The presence of multiple fused aromatic rings increases the molecular weight and rigidity, leading to a higher melting point. Estimated contribution could be +50 degrees.\n- Carbonyl group: Carbonyl functionalities typically raise the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be +30 degrees.\n- Methyl group: Methyl groups generally increase the molecular weight leading to higher melting points, although the contribution is typically small. Estimated contribution might be +5 degrees.\n- Cumulative impact: The individual contributions of each group can be summed up, but it's also necessary to consider that the presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 5.5 (for the benzene rings) + 50 (for the fused aromatic rings) + 30 (for the carbonyl group) + 5 (for the methyl group) = 90 degrees Celsius. Adding a consideration for synergistic effects, a more refined estimate taking into account the cumulative polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups might be approximated as +80 degrees, leading to a predicted melting point of 170 degrees Celsius.",
