    "Reason": "The compound 2-(1-boc-4-piperidinyloxy)-n-methylacetamide has a melting point that is influenced by several functional groups and structural features. The presence of a piperidine ring, which has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C, is significantly altered by the addition of other functional groups and structural features. The methyl group, which is typically a small contributor to the melting point, can increase the melting point by +5\u00b0C. The Boc group, which is a protective group, can also contribute to the melting point, although the exact contribution is difficult to estimate. The presence of a piperidine ring and the Boc group can contribute to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can significantly increase the melting point, this effect might contribute an estimated +50\u00b0C. The methyl group, due to its bulkiness, increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which would typically raise the melting point; assuming an additive effect, the methyl group can contribute approximately +5\u00b0C to the melting point. Summing these contributions, the predicted increase over the base value of methylacetamide would be 50\u00b0C (piperidine ring) + 5\u00b0C (methyl group), amounting to a +55\u00b0C increase.",
