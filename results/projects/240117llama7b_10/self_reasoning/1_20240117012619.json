    "Reason": "The target compound, propiophenone, 3,3-diphenyl- has a melting point of 105 degrees Celsius. The phenyl groups introduce electron-donating ability and increase the molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point. The presence of a methyl group on the alpha position of the phenyl ring also introduces steric hindrance, which can further increase the melting point.",
