    "Reason": "The base compound benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a dimethylamino group increases the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. The methyl groups contribute to the molecular weight and rigidity, which can also contribute to the melting point. The nitrile group itself has a melting point of around -20 degrees Celsius due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of four methyl groups adds to the molecular weight and rigidity, which can contribute to the melting point.",
