    "Reason": "The basic unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of multiple phenyl groups increases the melting point due to increased steric hindrance and electron-donating ability. Each phenyl group contributes to an increase in melting point by approximately 50 to 80 degrees Celsius due to increased hydrogen bonding capability and rigidity in the molecular structure. The overall effect of the two phenyl groups could be estimated to increase the melting point by 100 to 160 degrees Celsius.",
