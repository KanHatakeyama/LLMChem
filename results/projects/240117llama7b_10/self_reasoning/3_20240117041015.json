    "Reason": "The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, each of which can contribute to the melting point. The base structure of the molecule is an oxazole ring, which has a melting point of approximately -20\u00b0C. The nitro group can increase the melting point by approximately +60\u00b0C due to its polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. The phenyl group can also increase the melting point by approximately +60\u00b0C due to its planarity and increased molecular weight. The furan ring can increase the melting point by approximately +40\u00b0C due to its polarity and conjugation. The methylidene group can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to its increased molecular weight. The total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -20 (base) + 60 (nitro group) + 60 (phenyl group) + 40 (furan ring) + 20 (methylidene group) = 190\u00b0C.",
