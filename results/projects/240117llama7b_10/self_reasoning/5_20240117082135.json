    "Reason": "The base compound, isoxazole, has a melting point of 105 degrees Celsius. The methyl group attached to the base unit increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which can contribute to a higher melting point. A rough estimate for the contribution of the methyl group would be +20 degrees. The carboxylic acid group also raises the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. A rough estimate for its contribution would be +50 degrees.",
