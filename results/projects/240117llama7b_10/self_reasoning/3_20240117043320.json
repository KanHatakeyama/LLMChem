    "Reason": "The presence of the pyrazole ring contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and rigidity, estimated to increase the melting point by +20 to +30\u00b0C. The amino group contributes to the melting point due to its polarity and hydrogen bonding capability, estimated to increase the melting point by +20 to +30\u00b0C. The methylsulfanyl group contributes to the melting point due to its polarity and sulfur's high melting point, estimated to increase the melting point by +20 to +30\u00b0C. The nitro group contributes to the melting point due to its polarity and electron-withdrawing ability, estimated to increase the melting point by +10 to +20\u00b0C. The carbonyl group contributes to the melting point due to its polarity and increased molecular weight, estimated to increase the melting point by +10 to +20\u00b0C. The presence of multiple functional groups can also contribute to synergistic effects, potentially increasing the melting point by +10 to +20\u00b0C.",
