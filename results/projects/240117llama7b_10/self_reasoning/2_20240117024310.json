    "Reason": "The compound 5-fluoro-2-methylbenzyl alcohol has a basic hydrocarbon backbone with a fluorine atom attached to the carbon chain, which increases the melting point due to the increased electronegativity of fluorine. The methyl group adds steric bulk and electron donating ability, which also raises the melting point. The alcohol functional group does not significantly affect the melting point.",
