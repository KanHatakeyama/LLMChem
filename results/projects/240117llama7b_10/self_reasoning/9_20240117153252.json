    "Reason": "To predict the melting point of 7-methylquinoline, we consider the known melting point influence of various functional groups relative to quinoline, which has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. Methylation of a quinoline ring can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C. The presence of a methyl group also contributes to van der Waals interactions, so we add +10\u00b0C for the methyl group. The quinoline ring itself has a melting point contribution of +40\u00b0C due to its planarity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Conjugation and aromaticity within the compound tend to stabilize it, but considering the complexity of the molecule and the presence of a methyl group, the effect of aromaticity might be comparatively minimal, estimated at -5\u00b0C overall. Therefore, we calculate as follows: Quinoline (5.5) + Methyl group (10) = 5.5 + 10 = 15.5\u00b0C",
