    "Reason": "- Cyclohexyl group: This is a large, planar, and electron-rich group, which generally increases the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +40\u00b0C.\n- Benzoic acid: A carboxylic acid group is polar and can form hydrogen bonds, thus increasing the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +30\u00b0C.\n- Total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -40 (base) + 40 (cyclohexyl group) + 30 (benzoic acid) = 110\u00b0C.",
