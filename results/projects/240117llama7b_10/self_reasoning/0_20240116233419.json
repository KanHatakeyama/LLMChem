    "Reason": "The compound has a naphthalene ring, which has a melting point of 120 degrees Celsius. The carboxamide group typically raises the melting point by around 50 degrees Celsius due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. The presence of two hydroxyl groups on the naphthalene ring also contributes to an increase in melting point, estimated to be around 70 degrees Celsius. The n-butyl group, which is attached to the naphthalene ring, can also contribute to a decrease in melting point due to steric hindrance, estimated to be around -20 degrees Celsius. The overall effect of these functional groups can be estimated to be a net increase of around 150 degrees Celsius in the melting point.",
