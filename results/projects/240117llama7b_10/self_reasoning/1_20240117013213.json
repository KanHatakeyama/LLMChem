    "Reason": "The functional groups in 5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxylic acid contribute to its melting point as follows:\n\n- Methyl group: Adds a methyl group to the isoxazole ring, which increases the molecular weight and rigidity, leading to a higher melting point. Estimated increase of +20.\n- Carboxylic acid group: A carboxylic acid functional group typically raises the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. Estimated increase of +50.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of 100\u00b0C for a simple aromatic compound, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
