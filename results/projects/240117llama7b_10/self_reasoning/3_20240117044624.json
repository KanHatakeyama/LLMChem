    "Reason": "- The presence of a nitro functional group can increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions. Estimated increase of +10.\n- The aromatic ring system contributes to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point. Estimated increase of +20.\n- The acetyl group can contribute to the melting point due to its bulkiness and steric hindrance. Estimated increase of +10.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
