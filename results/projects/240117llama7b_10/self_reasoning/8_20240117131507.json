    "Reason": "The presence of a nitro group can increase the melting point due to its ability to participate in pi-pi stacking interactions, potentially raising the melting point by +50\u00b0C. The methylsulfanyl group can also contribute to a higher melting point due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The pyrazole ring itself has a melting point of around 40\u00b0C due to its planarity and rigidity. The carboxyl group can also contribute to a higher melting point due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The presence of a sulfur atom can also contribute to a higher melting point due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10\u00b0C.
