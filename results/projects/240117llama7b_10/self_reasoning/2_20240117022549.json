    "Reason": "- Benzene ring: The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- Hydroxyl group: Hydroxyl groups typically raise the melting point by +5 degrees Celsius.\n- Ester group: Ester functionalities contribute to melting point elevation through dipole-dipole interactions. Estimated at +10 degrees.\n- Cumulative impact: The individual contributions of each group can be summed up, but it's also necessary to consider that the presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 5.5 (for the benzene rings) + 5 (for the hydroxyl group) + 10 (for the ester group) = 10.5 degrees Celsius. Adding a consideration for synergistic effects, a more refined estimate taking into account the cumulative polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups might be approximated as +10 degrees, leading to a predicted melting point of 11.5 degrees Celsius.",
