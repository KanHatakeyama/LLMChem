    "Reason": "Aconine is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups that contribute to its melting point. The base molecule, cocaine, has a melting point of -1.5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group (CNO) increases the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. The methyl group (CH3) adds to the molecular weight and van der Waals interactions, contributing to a higher melting point. The aromatic ring system (C6C5OC) contributes to the melting point due to increased conjugation and stabilization. The presence of a carboxylic acid group (COC) can increase the melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased polarity. The presence of a sulfur atom (C5C1N) can also contribute to the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. The overall effect of these functional groups can be estimated as follows: Benzene (base molecule) -1.5, Nitro group (CNO) +20, Methyl group (CH3) +5, Aromatic ring (C6C5OC) +20, Carboxylic acid (COC) +10, Sulfur (C5C1N) +15.",
