    "Reason": "The basic unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of multiple phenyl groups increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and increased intermolecular interactions. Each phenyl group contributes to an increase in melting point by approximately 50 to 80\u00b0C due to increased hydrogen bonding capability and increased molecular weight. The diphenyl group can contribute to a further increase in melting point due to increased rigidity and reduced rotational freedom. A rough estimate for the diphenyl group might be around 100 to 150\u00b0C.",
