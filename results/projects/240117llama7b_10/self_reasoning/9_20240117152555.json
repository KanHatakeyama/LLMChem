    "Reason": "The base unit indole has a melting point of 5.5\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro functional group can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution might be +50 degrees. The presence of a methyl group attached to the nitro functional group can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. An estimated contribution might be +10 degrees. The presence of a carbonyl group can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution might be +50 degrees. The presence of a methyl group attached to the carbonyl group can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and rigidity. An estimated contribution might be +10 degrees.",
