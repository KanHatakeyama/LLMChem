    "Reason": "The base compound 1-furan-2-ylprop-2-en-1-one has a melting point of -20 degrees Celsius. The bromine atom in the 5-bromofuran-2-yl group increases the molecular weight and electronegativity, which can increase the melting point. The furan ring itself has a melting point increase of around 40 degrees Celsius due to its planarity and conjugation. The methyl group on the 2-endo position can also contribute to the melting point by increasing the molecular weight and rigidity. The total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -20 (base) + 40 (furan ring) + 5 (methyl group) + 50 (bromine) = 75 degrees Celsius.",
