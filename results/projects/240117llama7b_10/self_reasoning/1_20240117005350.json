    "Reason": "- The presence of the phenyl group increases the melting point due to its pi-pi stacking interactions and increased molecular complexity. Estimated increase of +60\u00b0C.\n- The chlorine atoms contribute to the polarity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point. Estimated increase of +20\u00b0C.\n- The hydrazine group can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point. Estimated increase of +30\u00b0C.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of -20\u00b0C for a simple hydrocarbon, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
