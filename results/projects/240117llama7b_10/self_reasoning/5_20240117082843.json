    "Reason": "The nitro functional group contributes to the melting point due to its electronegative nature and the ability to participate in intermolecular interactions. The nitro group can increase the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius. The anthracene base structure has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The presence of a nitro group increases the melting point by approximately +30 degrees Celsius.",
