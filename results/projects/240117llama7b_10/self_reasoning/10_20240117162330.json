    "Reason": "Benzoic acid itself has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a hydroxyl group in the base molecule can increase the melting point due to increased intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The ethyl ester group can contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance. The presence of a hydroxyl group can increase the melting point by +50 degrees Celsius. The ethyl ester group can contribute to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and steric hindrance.
