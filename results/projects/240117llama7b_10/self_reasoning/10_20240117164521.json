    "Reason": "The compound gestonorone caproate has a complex structure composed of a phenyl group, a furan ring, a carbonyl group, and a caproic acid group. Each functional group can contribute to the melting point:\n- Phenyl group: A single phenyl group usually raises the melting point of a compound due to its pi-pi stacking interactions and increased molecular complexity. Estimate an increase of approximately +60\u00b0C.\n- Furan ring: Heteroaromatic rings can have variable effects on melting point, depending on the substitution pattern. For this case, considering the conjugation and additional ring, we might estimate an increase of about +40\u00b0C.\n- Carbonyl group: Being a polar functional group, it can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point. Estimate an increase of +50\u00b0C.\n- Caproic acid group: Caproic acid is a polar functional group that can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point. Estimate an increase of +50\u00b0C.",
