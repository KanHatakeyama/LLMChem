    "Reason": "The compound 2-phenoxypropionic acid has a phenolic hydroxyl group, which is known to increase the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities. The carboxylic acid group also contributes to the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. The presence of a methyl group attached to the benzene ring can also increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight. However, the overall effect of the methyl group is relatively small.",
