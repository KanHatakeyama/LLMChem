    "Reason": "The compound carbonic acid, diphenyl ester, has a structure composed of a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid functional group through an ester linkage. The presence of the phenyl group increases the melting point due to increased hydrophobic effect and resonance stabilization, which can contribute to an increase of approximately 60 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid functional group also contributes to an increase in melting point due to hydrogen bonding and increased polarity, which can be estimated to contribute around 40 degrees Celsius. The ester linkage can be expected to reduce the planarity of the molecule and decrease the melting point by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the estimated shift would be 60 (phenyl group) + 40 (carboxylic acid) - 10 (ester linkage).",
