    "Reason": "The base compound aniline has a melting point of around -6 degrees Celsius. Introducing an iodine substituent increases the melting point since iodine is a heavy atom which contributes significantly to the molecular weight and increases intermolecular interactions such as London dispersion forces. Additionally, the electron-withdrawing nature of the iodine may help stabilize the charge distribution in the molecule. However, on the aromatic ring, the effect of a single iodine on the melting point is limited when compared to more polar functional groups. Given the data for other haloanilines, the effect of the iodine might roughly be estimated between +50 to +70 degrees Celsius.",
