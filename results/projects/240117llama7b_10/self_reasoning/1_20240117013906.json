    "Reason": "Secobarbital is a barbiturate, a class of drugs that were once widely used as sedatives and hypnotics. The molecule has a ring structure with a nitrogen atom at the 1-position, which contributes to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of a methyl group at the 5-position and a methoxy group at the 2-position adds steric hindrance and electronegativity, which can increase the melting point. The ester functional group at the 3-position can also contribute to the melting point through dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nUsing a base melting point of 20 degrees Celsius for a simple long chain hydrocarbon, the estimated melting point of secobarbital is around 100 degrees Celsius.",
