    "Reason": "The basic unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom adds a rigidity to the molecule and increases the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. A rough estimate for the chlorine group could be +50 degrees. The methoxy group can also contribute to an increase in melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding capability and rigidity. An estimated contribution for the methoxy group could be around +30 degrees.",
