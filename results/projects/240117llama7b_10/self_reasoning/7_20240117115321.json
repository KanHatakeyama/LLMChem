    "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by various factors such as the molecular weight, symmetry, intermolecular forces, and polarity. The base structure of the compound is a furan ring, which has a melting point of around -10 degrees Celsius due to its polar nature and ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions. The presence of a bromine atom adds to the molecular weight and polarity, which can increase the melting point. The furan ring itself can engage in pi-pi interactions, adding to the overall stabilization of the solid state. The presence of a methyl group adds to the molecular weight and can potentially increase the melting point due to increased steric hindrance. The bromine atom can also increase the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and polarity. The presence of a furan ring can also increase the melting point due to its polar nature and ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions.",
