    "Reason": "The compound's melting point is influenced by the following factors:\n\n- The presence of a bicyclic ring system, which can contribute to increased melting points due to increased steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding potential. Estimated contribution: +40 degrees Celsius.\n- The thiourea group, which is a polar functional group that can participate in hydrogen bonding, raising the melting point. Estimated contribution: +30 degrees Celsius.\n- The phenyl group, which can contribute to increased melting points due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. Estimated contribution: +20 degrees Celsius.\n- The methyl groups, which can increase the molecular weight and contribute to higher melting points. Estimated contribution: +5 degrees Celsius.\n- The bicyclic ring system's presence can also lead to synergistic effects due to increased steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding potential, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 40 (for the bicyclic ring system) + 30 (for the thiourea group) + 20 (for the phenyl group) + 5 (for the methyl groups) = 95 degrees Celsius. Adding a consideration for synergistic effects, a more refined estimate taking into account the cumulative polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups might be approximated as +80 degrees, leading to a predicted melting point of 175 degrees Celsius.",
