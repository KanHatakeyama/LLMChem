    "Reason": "- Chlorine and fluorine atoms: Both halogen atoms contribute to increased melting point due to their increased electronegativity and polarizability. Estimated increase of +50 for each halogen.\n- Purine ring: A rigid, planar, and aromatic ring system. Estimated increase of +40 due to its presence.\n- Carbon chain: A simple hydrocarbon chain with a melting point of around 20\u00b0C.\n\nStarting with a base value of 20\u00b0C for the carbon chain, the purine ring adds +40, and the halogen atoms add +50 each, for a total estimated increase of +110.",
