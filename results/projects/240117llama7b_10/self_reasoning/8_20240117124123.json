    "Reason": "The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule can increase the melting point due to its rigidity and planarity. The methyl group attached to the phenyl ring can also contribute to the melting point due to its bulkiness and increased molecular weight. The phenyl group itself has a melting point of around 41\u00b0C. The presence of a carbonyl group and a methyl group can increase the melting point by +50\u00b0C and +20\u00b0C, respectively. The overall contribution from these functional groups would be +70\u00b0C.",
