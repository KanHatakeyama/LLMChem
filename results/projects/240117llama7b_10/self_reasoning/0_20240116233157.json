    "Reason": "Gestonorone caproate is a synthetic steroid with a complex molecular structure featuring a 17-alpha-hydroxy group, a methyl group, and a cyclohexyl group. The presence of the hydroxyl group and the methyl group contribute to the molecule's hydrophobicity, while the cyclohexyl group may enhance intermolecular interactions. The aromatic ring system also contributes to the molecule's rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n\nBased on the structural features of gestonorone caproate, the melting point is predicted to be around 100\u00b0C.",
