    "Reason": "The compound 7-methylquinoline has a structure composed of a benzene ring with a methyl group attached to the nitrogen atom. The methyl group increases the melting point due to its electronegativity and increased molecular weight. The quinoline ring itself has a melting point of around 42 degrees Celsius due to its planarity and aromatic character. The methyl group adds an estimated +25 degrees Celsius due to its increased molecular weight and electronegativity.",
