    "Reason": "- Chlorine and fluorine atoms: Both halogen atoms contribute to increased melting point due to their higher electronegativity and increased intermolecular interactions. Estimated increase of +50 for each halogen.\n- Purine ring: A six-membered ring with nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 6 positions, contributing to rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding. Estimated increase of +20.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 40\u00b0C for a simple aromatic hydrocarbon, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
