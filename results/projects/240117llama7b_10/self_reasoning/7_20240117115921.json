    "Reason": "The base compound quinoline has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The methyl group attached to the quinoline ring can increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and increased steric hindrance. The methyl group also contributes to the rigidity of the molecule, which can increase the melting point. The quinoline ring itself has a melting point of -6 degrees Celsius. The methyl group can increase the melting point by +20 degrees Celsius.",
