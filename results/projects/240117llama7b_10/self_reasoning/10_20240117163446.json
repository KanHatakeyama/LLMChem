    "Reason": "The base compound cyclohexanol has a melting point of -5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a chlorine atom increases the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and polarity. Chlorine atoms typically increase the melting point by +50 degrees. The trans configuration of the chlorine adds a small degree of steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point by +10 degrees.",
