The two ethenyl (vinyl) groups each introduce additional steric hindrance and electron donating ability via their alkene double bond, which typically decreases the melting point since they disrupt the crystal lattice and lower intermolecular attractions. However, the release of ring strain that comes with substitution at the meta positions tends to raise melting points. Nonetheless, the overall effect of the vinyl groups is more significant in this case.
