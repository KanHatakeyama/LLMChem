However, the flexible linkages introduced by the hexane-1,6-diol may slightly decrease the melting point because they reduce the planarity and potential packing efficiency of the molecule. Starting with a base value for hexane-1,6-diol around 42 degrees Celsius (as a rough approximation considering butane-1,4-diol has a melting point at 20 degrees Celsius and accounting for the extra two carbons), the addition of four pyridine rings each might introduce an increase of approximately 25 degrees Celsius, due to their aromatic character and ability to participate in \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking.
