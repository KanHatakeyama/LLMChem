Pregnenolone has several functional groups: the ketone (C=O) group, an alcohol (OH) group, and multiple cyclohexane and cyclopentane rings. Each of these will affect the melting point differently. Generally, the ketone group is capable of forming dipole-dipole interactions, which typically could increase the melting point by roughly 20-30 degrees due to stronger intermolecular forces. Hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, which are strong intermolecular forces, potentially raising the melting point by about 40-50 degrees. The presence of multiple ring systems contributes significantly to the rigidity of the molecule and increases the intermolecular forces present, which also raises the melting point; this effect might contribute an additional 20-30 degrees for each ring system present.

The presence of phenol groups as the base unit, with a typical melting point of around 41\u00b0C, is significantly altered by the addition of other functional groups and structural features. The azo (N=N) linkage tends to contribute to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can significantly increase the melting point, this effect might contribute an estimated +50\u00b0C. Each tert-butyl group, due to its bulkiness, increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which would typically raise the melting point; assuming an additive effect, each tert-butyl can contribute approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point. With eight tert-butyl groups present, the overall contribution from the tert-butyl groups would be +160\u00b0C. Summing these contributions, the predicted increase over the base value of phenol would be 50\u00b0C (azo linkage) + 160\u00b0C (tert-butyl groups), amounting to a +210\u00b0C increase.",

We start with the base structure of 1,3-dioxane, which has a melting point of approximately -40\u00b0C. Each functional group will modify this base value. It contains two 2,2-dimethyl groups, a phenyl group attached to a furan ring through a methylene linkage, and two carbonyl groups on the dioxane ring:\n- 2,2-Dimethyl groups: These add steric bulk and increase molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +20\u00b0C for both methyl groups together.\n- Phenyl group: A single phenyl group usually raises the melting point of a compound due to its pi-pi stacking interactions and increased molecular complexity. Estimate an increase of approximately +60\u00b0C.\n- Furan ring: Heteroaromatic rings can have variable effects on melting point, depending on the substitution pattern. For this case, considering the conjugation and additional ring, we might estimate an increase of about +40\u00b0C.\n- Methylene linkage: Being a small linker, its influence is small. However, it adds rigidity to the molecule, so we can estimate a small increase of +5\u00b0C.\n- Two carbonyl groups on the dioxane ring: Carbonyl groups are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, thus increasing the melting point. However, in this case they are within a ring system, which makes them unable to engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Yet, they contribute to the rigidity and electronic distribution in the molecule. We can estimate an increase of approximately +50\u00b0C for both carbonyl groups together. The total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -40 (base) + 20 (dimethyl groups) + 60 (phenyl group) + 40 (furan ring) + 5 (methylene linkage) + 50 (carbonyl groups) = 135\u00b0C.",
