Each additional -OH group contributes to the increase: \n\n- Hydroxyl group: For simplicity, if we consider incremental effects, taking cyclohexanol as a starting point with a melting point of around 25.93\u00b0C, each additional -OH group could contribute roughly (249.5 - 25.93)/5 \u2248 44.7\u00b0C to the melting point as they allow for extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which stabilizes the solid state. However, this is a simplified approximation because the effect of each additional -OH group is not perfectly additive due to steric and electronic considerations.\n\nTherefore: \n- Basic unit (cyclohexanol): 25.93 \n- Six hydroxyl groups (5 additional to the parent compound): 5 * 44.7 \u2248 223.5\nCombined estimated effect: 25.93 + 223.5 \u2248 249.43\u00b0C",
