    "Reason": "- Benzene ring: The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- Nitro group: Nitro groups can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Estimated contribution could be +20 degrees.\n- Bromine atom: Bromine atoms can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Estimated contribution could be +50 degrees.\n- Hydrazine group: Hydrazine groups can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Estimated contribution could be +30 degrees.\n- Cumulative impact: The individual contributions of each group can be summed up, but it's also necessary to consider that the presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 5.5 (for the benzene rings) + 20 (for the nitro group) + 50 (for the bromine atom) + 30 (for the hydrazine group) = 115 degrees Celsius. Adding a consideration for synergistic effects, a more refined estimate taking into account the cumulative polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups might be approximated as +80 degrees, leading to a predicted melting point of 195 degrees Celsius.",
