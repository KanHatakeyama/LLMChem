    "Reason": "The compound in question has several functional groups that influence its melting point:\n- Indole ring: The base unit indole has a melting point of 105 degrees Celsius.\n- Phenyl group: The presence of a phenyl group can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be +20 degrees.\n- Vinyl group: Vinyl groups generally lower the melting point due to their rigidity and the potential for disrupting the crystal lattice. An estimated contribution could be -10 degrees.\n- Chlorine atoms: Chlorine atoms can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be +50 degrees.\n- Sulfonyl group: Sulfonamides generally increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be +20 degrees.\n- Dichlorophenyl group: The presence of two chlorine atoms on a phenyl ring can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. An estimated contribution could be +50 degrees.",
