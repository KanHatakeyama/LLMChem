    "Reason": "- Pyridine ring: A basic unit with a melting point of -12\u00b0C.\n- Fluorine: A highly electronegative atom that can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Estimated increase of +20.\n- Amino group: A basic nitrogen atom that can increase the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Estimated increase of +10.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of -12\u00b0C for pyridine, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
