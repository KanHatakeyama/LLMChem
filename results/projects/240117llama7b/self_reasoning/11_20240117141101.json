    "Reason": "Leflunomide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. Let's consider each group's effect:\n- Benzene ring: The benzene ring itself has a melting point of approximately -80\u00b0C. \n- Carbon chain (Cc2oncc2): The carbon chain adds to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and potential for van der Waals interactions. Let's estimate an increase of +20 degrees. \n- Nitrogen (Nc1ccc(cc1)): Nitrogen-containing compounds typically have a higher melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding potential. Let's estimate an increase of +30 degrees. \n- Carboxylic acid (C(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)): The carboxylic acid group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point. Let's estimate an increase of +20 degrees. \n- Fluorine (F): Fluorine atoms can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point. Let's estimate an increase of +5 degrees. \n- Phosphorus (F): Phosphorus can participate in hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point. Let's estimate an increase of +5 degrees. \nConsidering these functional groups, we can estimate the melting point for leflunomide: -80 + 20 + 30 + 20 + 5 + 5 + 5.",
