    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be aniline (C6H5NH2), which has a melting point of -23.4\u00b0C. Given that 4-dimethylaminobenzonitrile has a nitro group (NO2) and two methyl groups (CH3), which can increase the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance, we can estimate the effect as follows:\n- Nitro group (NO2): +20\u00b0C due to increased hydrogen bonding and potential for increased polarity.\n- Methyl groups (CH3): +10\u00b0C due to increased size and mass, which can reduce the effectiveness of hydrogen bonding on a per-atom basis.\nTherefore: \n- Basic unit (aniline): -23.4\n- Nitro group (NO2): +20.0\n- Two methyl groups (CH3): +10.0\nCombined estimated effect: -23.4 + 20.0 + 10.0 \u2248 53.4\u00b0C",
