    "Reason": "- Inositol is a sugar molecule with a melting point of 220 \u00b0C. \n- The molecular weight of d-inositol is 246.3 g/mol, which is significantly higher than that of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (187.1 g/mol). \n- The molecular structure of inositol contains several hydroxyl (-OH) groups, which are known to increase the melting point of a compound due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds. \n- The molecular structure of inositol also contains several oxygen atoms, which can increase the melting point due to their ability to form strong London dispersion forces. \n- The presence of a ring structure in inositol can also contribute to a higher melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and the formation of stronger intermolecular forces. \nConsidering the individual effects, one might expect the higher molecular weight, the presence of hydroxyl and oxygen atoms, and the ring structure to contribute to a higher melting point.",
