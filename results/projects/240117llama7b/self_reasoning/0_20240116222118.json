    "Reason": "The base structure for the target compound is a spiro[2.5]octane ring, which has a melting point of approximately 120 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two methyl groups on the 6- and 8-positions of the ring can significantly lower the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and reduced symmetry of the molecule, which disrupts the efficient packing in the solid state. Each methyl group is expected to reduce the melting point by approximately 20 degrees, resulting in a total reduction of 40 degrees for the two methyl groups.",
