    "Reason": "The base unit for indazole is indole, which has a melting point of -5.5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group (NO2) adds a significant increase in melting point due to its electronegativity and potential for pi-pi interactions. Let's estimate this effect to be +60 degrees. The indazole ring itself has a slightly higher melting point than indole due to its increased molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding. Let's estimate this effect to be +10 degrees. The nitro group can also increase the melting point due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Let's estimate this effect to be +20 degrees. The methyl group (CH3) can slightly lower the melting point due to the increase in molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding. Let's estimate this effect to be -5 degrees.",
