    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. Given that methyl propyl sulfide has a sulfur atom, which can increase the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding, we can estimate the effect as +30\u00b0C. Additionally, the methyl group (CH3) and the propyl group (CH2CH2CH3) contribute to the melting point, with the methyl group lowering it by -5\u00b0C and the propyl group raising it by +10\u00b0C.\nTherefore: \n- Basic unit (ethanol): -114.1 \n- Methyl group (CH3): -5 \n- Propyl group (CH2CH2CH3): +10 \nCombined estimated effect: -114.1 - 5 + 10 \u2248 -99.6\u00b0C",
