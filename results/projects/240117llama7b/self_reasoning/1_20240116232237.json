    "Reason": "- Basic unit, 2,3-diphenylprop-1-en-1-ol has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. \n- Hydroxy group (-OH): adds significantly since it introduces hydrogen bonding, which greatly increases the melting point. An educated estimate for this effect is +50\u00b0C to +70\u00b0C. \n- Nitro group (NO2): adds to the melting point due to its electronegativity and the polarizability of the nitrogen atom, which increases intermolecular forces. An estimated effect could be around +10\u00b0C to +15\u00b0C due to the polar nature of the C-N bond and potential increase in molecular symmetry. \n- Phenyl groups: add steric bulk and increase molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +20\u00b0C for each phenyl group.",
