    "Reason": "The parent compound for this molecule is 2,3-diphenylpropionol, which has a melting point of 105.5 degrees Celsius. The hydroxyimino group (-NH2) is a polar functional group that can form hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules, which can increase the melting point. The 2-nitrophenyl group (-NO2) is an electron-withdrawing group that can also increase the melting point. The diphenyl moiety contributes to the melting point through London dispersion forces. The overall effect of the hydroxyimino and 2-nitrophenyl groups is estimated to be around 30-40 degrees Celsius, while the diphenyl moiety contributes around 50-60 degrees Celsius.",
