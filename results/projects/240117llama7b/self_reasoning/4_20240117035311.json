    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is butanoic acid, which has a melting point of 12.5 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom adds significant mass and electronegativity, which can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces. The 3-oxo group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The ethyl ester group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding.",
