    "Reason": "- The presence of a phenyl group increases the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and the potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n- The introduction of a chlorine substituent increases the molecular weight and polarity, which can enhance intermolecular interactions and increase the melting point.\n- The hydrazine group can form hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules, which can contribute to the melting point.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of 10\u00b0C for a simple hydrocarbon, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
