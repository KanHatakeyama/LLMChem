    "Reason": "- Ethyl group: A small alkyl group, typically does not significantly affect melting point.\n- Methoxy group: A small oxygen-containing group, which can increase the melting point due to potential hydrogen bonding. Estimated increase of +20.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
