    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is aniline, which has a melting point of 4.4 degrees Celsius. The presence of four methyl groups adds significant steric hindrance, which increases the melting point due to the increased difficulty in packing the molecules in the solid state. Each methyl group adds roughly 10 degrees Celsius to the melting point, and the presence of four groups increases the effect to 40 degrees Celsius.",
