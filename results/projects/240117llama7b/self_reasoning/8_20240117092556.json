    "Reason": "The structure of 2-phenoxypropionic acid consists of a carboxylic acid group, which has a melting point of approximately -5.5 degrees Celsius. The presence of a phenol group adds to the melting point due to its ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which increases the melting point. The estimated contribution of the phenol group to the melting point is approximately 95.1 degrees Celsius.",
