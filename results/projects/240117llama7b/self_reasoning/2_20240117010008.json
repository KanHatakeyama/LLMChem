    "Reason": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. \n- Chlorine: A heavy halogen like chlorine adds significant molecular weight and polarizability to the compound, which could reasonably be expected to increase the melting point due to stronger London dispersion forces. The chlorine group typically raises the melting point by an estimated +20 \u00b0C over unsubstituted benzene. \n- Methoxy group: The methoxy group is a polar and relatively small group that can form hydrogen bonds, which can increase the melting point. The estimated effect of a methoxy group is around +10 \u00b0C. \n- Methyl group: The methyl group is a relatively small and nonpolar group that can reduce the melting point due to the lack of hydrogen bonding potential. The estimated effect of a methyl group is around -5 \u00b0C. \nConsidering the individual effects, one might expect these functional groups to have mostly additive impacts on the melting point, but some deviation from strict additivity can occur due to the disruption of the aromatic system's symmetry by the substituents.",
