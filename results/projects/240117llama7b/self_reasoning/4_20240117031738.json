    "Reason": "The compound 2,2'-(E)-diazene-1,2-diylbis(4,6-di-tert-butylphenol) has a high melting point due to its molecular structure. The presence of phenol groups as the base unit, with a typical melting point of around 41\u00b0C, is significantly altered by the addition of other functional groups and structural features. The azo (N=N) linkage tends to contribute to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can significantly increase the melting point, this effect might contribute an estimated +50\u00b0C. Each tert-butyl group, due to its bulkiness, increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which would typically raise the melting point; assuming an additive effect, each tert-butyl can contribute approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point. With eight tert-butyl groups present, the overall contribution from the tert-butyl groups would be +160\u00b0C. Summing these contributions, the predicted increase over the base value of phenol would be 50\u00b0C (azo linkage) + 160\u00b0C (tert-butyl groups), amounting to a +210\u00b0C increase.",
