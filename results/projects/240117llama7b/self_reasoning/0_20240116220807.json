    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be 1-phenylthiourea, which has a melting point of 105.5 \u00b0C. The presence of two thiourea groups in the molecule increases the melting point due to the increased polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities. The thiourea group itself contributes to the melting point by approximately 60 \u00b0C. The bicyclic ring system in the molecule also contributes to the melting point, as it increases the molecular weight and polarity of the molecule. The presence of two methyl groups on the bicyclic ring also increases the polarity of the molecule, which can contribute to the melting point.",
