    "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-cyclohexylbenzoic acid is benzene, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a cyclohexyl group adds significant bulk and steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and reduced conformational freedom (estimated +20 \u00b0C). The carboxylic acid group (COOH) can form hydrogen bonds and increase the melting point (estimated +20 \u00b0C). The presence of a benzoic acid group can also increase the melting point due to its polarity and potential for pi-pi interactions (estimated +10 \u00b0C).",
