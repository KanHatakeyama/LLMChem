    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is acetone, which has a melting point of -56.4\u00b0C. Methyl groups typically increase the melting point due to their increased molecular weight and the potential for increased hydrogen bonding. Let's estimate a +20\u00b0C contribution from the methyl group. Nitro groups are highly electronegative and increase the melting point due to intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Let's estimate a +40\u00b0C contribution from the nitro group.",
