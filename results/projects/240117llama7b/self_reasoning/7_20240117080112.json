    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be acetone, which has a melting point of approximately -56.0 degrees Celsius. Methyl nitrite has a nitro functional group, which can significantly increase the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The nitro group can also participate in dimerization, which can further increase the melting point. Estimating the contribution of the nitro group to the melting point to be approximately 30 degrees Celsius, and considering the potential for dimerization, we can estimate the total effect to be around 60 degrees Celsius.",
