    "Reason": "The basic unit for indole-5-carbonitrile is indole, which has a melting point of approximately 105 degrees Celsius. The nitrile group typically raises the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions, which can be estimated to contribute about +20 degrees Celsius. The indole ring itself has a melting point of approximately 105 degrees Celsius. The presence of a carbon atom in the nitrile group can also contribute to a higher melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for van der Waals interactions, which can be estimated to contribute about +5 degrees Celsius.",
