    "Reason": "The base unit for comparison could be 2-methyl-2-propanol, which has a melting point of 10.5\u00b0C. The presence of a carboxylic acid group typically increases the melting point due to the polar nature of the C=O bond and the potential for hydrogen bonding. The methyl group adds to the melting point due to its electronegativity and the potential for increased steric hindrance. The isoxazole ring adds to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential for increased hydrogen bonding. The carboxylic acid group can increase the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C due to its polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding. The methyl group can increase the melting point by approximately +5\u00b0C to +10\u00b0C due to its electronegativity and potential for increased steric hindrance. The isoxazole ring can increase the melting point by approximately +10\u00b0C to +20\u00b0C due to its rigidity and potential for increased hydrogen bonding.",
