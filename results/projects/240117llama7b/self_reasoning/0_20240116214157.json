    "Reason": "The compound 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) has a structure composed of two phenyl rings linked by a carbon-carbon chain, with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon atoms. The presence of the chlorine atoms increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which can significantly increase the melting point. The phenyl rings themselves have a melting point of around 41 degrees Celsius, and the addition of the chlorine atoms can increase the melting point by about 20 degrees Celsius due to the increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. The carbon-carbon chain can also contribute to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can further increase the melting point.",
