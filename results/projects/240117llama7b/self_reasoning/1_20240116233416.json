    "Reason": "The melting point of indole-5-carbonitrile can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of 105.5\u00b0C. The nitrile group typically increases the melting point due to the increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Let's estimate a +20\u00b0C contribution from the nitrile group. The carbon chain has a melting point of around 30\u00b0C, and the aromatic ring contributes around 80\u00b0C.",
