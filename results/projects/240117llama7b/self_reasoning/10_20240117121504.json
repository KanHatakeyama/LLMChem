    "Reason": "Benzaldehyde azine has a melting point of approximately 105\u00b0C. The nitro group (NO2) in the molecule can increase the melting point due to its polarity and possible internal charge\u2013charge repulsion. The aromatic ring in the molecule can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The azide group (N3) can also increase the melting point due to its polarity and possible internal charge\u2013charge repulsion. The presence of multiple functional groups can also lead to a synergistic effect on the melting point.",
