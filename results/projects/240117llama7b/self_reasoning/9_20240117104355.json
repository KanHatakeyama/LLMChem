    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be butanoic acid, which has a melting point of approximately -12.5 degrees Celsius. The chlorine atom in the 4-chloro-3-oxo group increases the melting point due to its electronegativity and the potential for increased intermolecular forces. The ethyl ester group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and potential for increased intermolecular forces. The chloro group can increase the melting point by approximately +60 degrees Celsius, and the ethyl ester group can increase the melting point by approximately +20 degrees Celsius.",
