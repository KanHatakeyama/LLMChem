    "Reason": "- Halogen substitution: The two chlorine atoms add +10 to the melting point due to increased electronegativity and polarizability.\n- Hydrazine group: The nitrogen-hydrogen bonding and the potential for hydrogen bonding with other molecules increase the melting point by +20.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
