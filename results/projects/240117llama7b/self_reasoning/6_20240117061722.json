    "Reason": "The basic unit for 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) is aniline, which has a melting point of -10.5 \u00b0C. The presence of two chlorine atoms adds significant mass and induces strong dipole moments due to their electronegativity, which can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces (each chloro group approximately +60 \u00b0C). The methylene bridge (CH2) adds rigidity and potential hydrogen bonding sites, which can increase the melting point (approximately +20 \u00b0C). The presence of two non-equivalent functional groups (chlorines and methylene) in the para position relative to each other may slightly reduce symmetry and possibly decrease the overall effect on melting point slightly when compared to a more symmetrically substituted molecule.",
