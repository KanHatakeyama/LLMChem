    "Reason": "The compound 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. The basic unit for this compound is the aniline ring, which has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The two chlorine atoms on the aniline ring increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. The methylene bridges between the two aniline rings also contribute to the melting point, as they provide additional rigidity and hydrogen bonding opportunities. The overall effect of these functional groups is to increase the melting point by approximately 30 to 40 degrees Celsius.",
