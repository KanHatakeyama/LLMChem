    "Reason": "The compound 2'-Deoxyuridine has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The base unit, a sugar molecule, has a melting point of around 150\u00b0C. The nitrogen atom in the nitrogenous base contributes to the melting point due to its electronegativity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, adding +20\u00b0C. The oxygen atom in the sugar molecule can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group in the sugar molecule can also contribute to the melting point due to its polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions, adding +10\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group can significantly increase the melting point due to its strong electronegative nature and the capability for intermolecular interactions, contributing approximately +30\u00b0C. The overall effect of the functional groups in the compound is estimated to be +20\u00b0C for the nitrogenous base, +10\u00b0C for the oxygen atom, +10\u00b0C for the carbonyl group, and +30\u00b0C for the nitro group.",
