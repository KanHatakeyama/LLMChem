    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. Considering the structural changes leading to methyl propyl sulfide, the following should be noted:\n- The methyl group (CH3) attached to the sulfur atom in methyl propyl sulfide increases the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding, which we can estimate as +30\u00b0C compared to ethanol.\n- The propyl group (C3H7) attached to the sulfur atom in methyl propyl sulfide increases the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for increased hydrogen bonding, which we can estimate as +20\u00b0C compared to ethanol.\n- The sulfur atom in methyl propyl sulfide increases the melting point due to increased polarity and potential for increased hydrogen bonding, which we can estimate as +20\u00b0C compared to ethanol.\nOverall, the addition of the methyl, propyl, and sulfur groups in methyl propyl sulfide gives a predicted melting point.",
