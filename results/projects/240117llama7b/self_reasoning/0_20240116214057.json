    "Reason": "- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. \n- Fluoro group: A heavy halogen like fluorine adds significant molecular weight and polarizability to the compound, which could reasonably be expected to increase the melting point due to stronger London dispersion forces. The fluoro group typically raises the melting point by an estimated +20 \u00b0C over unsubstituted benzene. \n- Methyl group: The methyl group is a relatively small and nonpolar group that does not significantly affect the melting point.\nConsidering the individual effects, one might expect these functional groups to have mostly additive impacts on the melting point, but some deviation from strict additivity can occur due to the disruption of the aromatic system's symmetry by the substituents.",
