    "Reason": "Indole-5-carbonitrile has a melting point that is higher than that of a simple aromatic ring due to the presence of a nitrogen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the melting point. The carbon chain in the carbonitrile group can also contribute to a decrease in melting point due to its rigidity and potential disruption of efficient molecular packing. The nitrogen atom can also increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The carbon chain can also contribute to a decrease in melting point due to its rigidity and potential disruption of efficient molecular packing.",
