    "Reason": "The parent compound for this prediction is phenylhydrazine, which has a melting point of 100 degrees Celsius. The introduction of two chlorine atoms to the phenyl ring is expected to increase the melting point due to the increased polarity and the potential for increased intermolecular forces. The chlorine atoms can also disrupt the crystal lattice, making it more difficult to melt. A conservative estimate for the increase in melting point due to the chlorine atoms is 20 degrees, which is added to the base melting point of phenylhydrazine.",
