    "Reason": "The compound 1-benzyl-4-boc-piperazine has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present:\n- Benzyl group: adds a rigid, planar structure with a high molecular weight, which typically increases the melting point. An estimated effect is +20\u00b0C.\n- Boc group (t-butyl): adds bulkiness and rigidity, which can increase the melting point. An estimated effect is +10\u00b0C.\n- Piperazine ring: has a melting point of approximately -10\u00b0C due to its symmetrical structure and potential for hydrogen bonding.\n- Carbon chain: adds a small effect due to its van der Waals interactions, estimated at +5\u00b0C.\nConsidering these adjustments, the values are summation of the estimated effects.",
