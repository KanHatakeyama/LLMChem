    "Reason": "- Macrocyclic ring structure: Adds rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Estimated to increase melting point by +40 over a basic hydrocarbon backbone.\n- Hydroxyl groups: Six hydroxyl groups capable of hydrogen bonding. Estimated to increase melting point by +5 per OH group for a total of +30.\n- Ester groups: Two ester functionalities contribute to melting point elevation through dipole-dipole interactions. Estimated at +5 per group, giving an increase of +10.\n- Stereochemistry: The molecule's multiple chiral centers allow for denser packing, likely to increase the melting point. Estimated increase of +10.\n\nStarting with a base melting point of around 20\u00b0C for simple long chain hydrocarbons, these adjustments lead to a total estimation.",
