    "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-cyclohexylbenzoic acid is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The presence of a cyclohexyl group adds significant bulk and steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and reduced conformational freedom. The carboxylic acid group can also contribute to the melting point due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The cyclohexyl group can also participate in pi-pi interactions, which can increase the melting point.",
