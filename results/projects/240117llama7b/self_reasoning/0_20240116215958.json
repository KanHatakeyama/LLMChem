    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is 2-methoxyphenol, which has a melting point of 10.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of an ethyl group increases the molecular weight and introduces additional steric hindrance, which can both contribute to a higher melting point. The methoxy group also introduces an oxygen atom, which can participate in hydrogen bonding and increase the polarity of the molecule, further contributing to a higher melting point. The estimated contribution of each group can be as follows: \n- Ethyl group: +10 degrees Celsius (based on the increase in molecular weight and steric hindrance)\n- Methoxy group: +20 degrees Celsius (based on the increased polarity and hydrogen bonding)",
