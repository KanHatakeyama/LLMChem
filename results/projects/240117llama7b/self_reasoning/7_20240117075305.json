    "Reason": "The molecular structure of 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol consists of a phenol backbone with an ethyl group and a methoxy group attached. The phenol backbone has a melting point of approximately -10\u00b0C. The ethyl group adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The methoxy group can contribute to the melting point due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The presence of both functional groups can also increase the melting point due to their ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, estimated at +5\u00b0C.",
