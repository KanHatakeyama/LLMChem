    "Reason": "The base compound, methyl nitrite, has a melting point of approximately -50.5 degrees Celsius. The nitro group (NO2) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. The methyl group (CH3) can also participate in hydrogen bonding and can increase the melting point due to its bulkiness. The nitro group can also increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and potential for pi-pi interactions. The methyl group can also increase the melting point due to its bulkiness.",
