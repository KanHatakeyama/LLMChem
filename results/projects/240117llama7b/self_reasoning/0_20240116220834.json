    "Reason": "The molecular structure of 5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxylic acid has a carboxylic acid functional group, which is known to lower the melting point of a compound due to the increased polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities. The methyl group also contributes to a higher melting point due to increased steric hindrance and rigidity. The isoxazole ring itself has a moderate effect on the melting point due to its planarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.",
