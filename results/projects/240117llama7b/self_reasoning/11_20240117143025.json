    "Reason": "The base structure for indole-5-carbonitrile is indole, which has a melting point of 105 degrees Celsius. The nitrile group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which tends to increase the melting point. The presence of a nitrogen atom also adds to the melting point due to its ability to form strong dipole-dipole interactions. The carbon chain in the nitrile group can also contribute to the melting point due to its rigidity and potential for van der Waals interactions. Considering the effects of each group, we estimate an increase of approximately 20 degrees for the nitrogen atom and 10 degrees for the carbon chain.",
