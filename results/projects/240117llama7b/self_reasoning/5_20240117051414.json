    "Reason": "The molecular structure of 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol consists of a phenol backbone with an ethyl group and a methoxy group attached. The phenol backbone has a melting point of approximately -10\u00b0C. The ethyl group adds approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and van der Waals interactions. The methoxy group adds approximately +10\u00b0C due to increased molecular weight and potential hydrogen bonding. The presence of both groups can also contribute to increased rigidity and crystalline packing, potentially increasing the melting point further.",
