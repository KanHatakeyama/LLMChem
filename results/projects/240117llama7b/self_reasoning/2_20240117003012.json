    "Reason": "The compound trans-4-chlorocyclohexanol can be broken down into the contributions of its functional groups to predict its melting point: \n\n- Basic unit, cyclohexane has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. \n- Chloro group (Cl): adds to the melting point due to its electronegativity and the polarizability of the chlorine atom, which increases intermolecular forces. An estimated effect could be around +10\u00b0C to +15\u00b0C due to the polar nature of the C-Cl bond and potential increase in molecular symmetry for the trans isomer.\n- Trans isomer: tends to have a higher melting point compared to the cis isomer due to better packing in the solid state. The effect can be estimated at around +5\u00b0C.\nConsidering these adjustments, the values are summation of the estimated effects.",
