    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be acetone, which has a melting point of -55.5\u00b0C. Methyl nitrite has a nitro group, which can increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Let's estimate an increase of +20\u00b0C for the nitro group.",
