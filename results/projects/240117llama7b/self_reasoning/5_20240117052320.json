    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be acetone, which has a melting point of approximately -56.0 degrees Celsius. Methyl nitrite has a nitro functional group, which can significantly increase the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The nitro group can also participate in dimerization, which can further increase the melting point.\n\nBased on the effects of a nitro group in a similar compound, such as nitromethane, we can estimate the contribution of the nitro group to be approximately 30 degrees Celsius. The methyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its increased steric hindrance and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Estimating the effect of the methyl group to be approximately 10 degrees Celsius, we get a total estimated effect of approximately 40 degrees Celsius.",
