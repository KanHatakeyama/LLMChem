    "Reason": "The compound diphenyl carbonic acid can be broken down into the contributions of its functional groups to predict its melting point: \n- Basic unit, carbonic acid has a melting point of 10.5\u00b0C. \n- Phenyl group: adds significantly since it introduces conjugation and potentially increases the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and electronegativity. An educated estimate for this effect is +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C. \n- Ester group: adds to the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and the polar nature of the ester bond. An estimated effect could be around +10\u00b0C to +15\u00b0C. \nConsidering these adjustments, the values are summation of the estimated effects.",
