    "Reason": "The molecular structure of 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol consists of a phenol backbone with an ethyl group and a methoxy group attached. The ethyl group adds a small increase in melting point due to its additional mass and potential for van der Waals interactions. The methoxy group, on the other hand, can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. The phenol backbone itself has a melting point of approximately -10\u00b0C.",
