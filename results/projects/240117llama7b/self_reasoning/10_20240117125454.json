    "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-phenoxypropionic acid is propanoic acid, which has a melting point of 10.5 \u00b0C. The phenoxy group (C6H4OH) adds significant bulk and polarity, which can increase the melting point due to stronger intermolecular forces. The carboxylic acid group (COOH) adds to the melting point due to its electronegativity and polarizability, which can increase the melting point. The presence of a phenoxy group in the para position can slightly reduce symmetry and possibly decrease the overall effect on melting point compared to a more symmetrically substituted molecule.",
