    "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-phenoxypropionic acid is propionic acid, which has a melting point of approximately 130 degrees Celsius. The addition of the phenoxy group generally raises the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and possible disruption of efficient molecular packing, typically raising the melting point by about 10 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid group in the propionic acid structure does not provide an additional change to the melting point in this case.",
