    "Reason": "2'-Deoxyuridine is a simple molecule with a melting point that can be predicted based on the functional groups present. The base unit, a sugar molecule, has a melting point of around 150\u00b0C. The nitrogen atom in the nitrogenous base contributes to the melting point due to its electronegativity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, adding +20\u00b0C. The oxygen atom in the sugar molecule also contributes to the melting point due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, adding +10\u00b0C. The presence of a carbonyl group in the sugar molecule can also increase the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and the potential for intermolecular interactions, adding +10\u00b0C. Finally, the presence of a hydroxyl group in the sugar molecule can also increase the melting point due to the increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, adding +5\u00b0C.",
