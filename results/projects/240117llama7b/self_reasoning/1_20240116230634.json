    "Reason": "The compound 2-chloro-1-phenylsulfonamidobenzene has a basic benzene ring with a chlorine atom attached, a sulfonamide group, and a phenyl group. The chlorine atom increases the melting point due to its high electronegativity and the resulting increased intermolecular forces. The sulfonamide group can also increase the melting point due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its conjugation and potential for pi-pi interactions.",
