    "Reason": "The melting point of indole-5-carbonitrile can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of 105.5\u00b0C. The nitrile group typically increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity. Let's estimate a +20\u00b0C contribution from the nitrile group. The aromatic ring in indole contributes to a higher melting point due to increased rigidity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Let's estimate a +10\u00b0C contribution from the aromatic ring. The carbon chain contributes to the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for van der Waals interactions. Let's estimate a +5\u00b0C contribution from the carbon chain.",
