    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is acetone, which has a melting point of approximately -56.0 degrees Celsius. Methyl nitrite has a nitro functional group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and electronegativity. The nitro group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point.\n\nBased on the effects of a single nitro group, we can estimate a contribution of approximately 20 to the melting point. Since methyl nitrite has two nitro groups, the total estimated increase would be approximately 40 degrees Celsius.",
