    "Reason": "- Base unit (benzaldehyde): The benzaldehyde unit has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C, based on the known trend for simple aromatic compounds.\n\n- Nitro group: The nitro group is highly electronegative and will increase the melting point due to intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. We'll add +40\u00b0C for this functional group.\n\n- Hydroxyl group: The hydroxyl group is polar and can contribute to a higher melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding capability. Let's add +20\u00b0C for this effect.\n\nAdding up all these contributions, we predict a melting point higher than that of a simple aromatic ring but considering the small size and the potential steric hindrance that might prevent tight packing, which could limit the increase in melting point.",
