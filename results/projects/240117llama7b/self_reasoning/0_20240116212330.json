    "Reason": "- Benzene rings: The base unit benzene has a melting point of 5.5 degrees Celsius.\n- Sulfoxide group: Sulfoxides are known to have a significant impact on the melting point due to the presence of a polar functional group. A rough estimate for its contribution could be +50 degrees.\n- Alkene group: Alkenes generally have a less significant impact on melting points compared to benzene rings, sulfoxides, or other polar functional groups, but could increase the melting point due to rigidity in the structure. An estimated contribution might be +10 degrees.\n- Cumulative impact: The individual contributions of each group can be summed up, but it's also necessary to consider that the presence of multiple polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups in one molecule can lead to synergistic effects, amplifying the increase in melting point beyond the sum of individual contributions.\nBased on the above considerations, a rough estimate would be 5.5 (for the benzene rings) + 50 (for the sulfoxide group) + 10 (for the alkene group) = 65 degrees Celsius. Adding a consideration for synergistic effects, a more refined estimate taking into account the cumulative polar and hydrogen bonding functional groups might be approximated as +60 degrees, leading to a predicted melting point of 125 degrees Celsius.",
