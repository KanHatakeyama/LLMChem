    "Reason": "The compound gestonorone caproate has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. The base unit, caproic acid, has a melting point of approximately -10\u00b0C. The ester group (C(=O)O) adds rigidity and increases the melting point due to increased van der Waals forces. The phenyl group (C6H5) adds a significant contribution to the melting point due to its electronegativity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The nitro group (NO2) adds a further increase in melting point due to its high electronegativity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of multiple functional groups in the molecule can also increase the melting point due to increased steric hindrance and potential for intermolecular interactions.",
