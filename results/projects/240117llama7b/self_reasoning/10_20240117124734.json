    "Reason": "The compound in question has a benzene ring, which has a melting point of approximately -8.5 degrees Celsius. The trichloromethyl group (chloroform) adds significant rigidity and polarity to the molecule, which can increase the melting point due to increased intermolecular hydrogen bonding and potential for dipole-dipole interactions. Let's estimate a +40 degree increase for the chloroform group.",
