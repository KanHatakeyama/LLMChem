    "Reason": "- The basic unit here is citrate (C6H5O7), which has a melting point of -12.5\u00b0C. When considering the structural changes leading to tri-n-butyl citrate, the following should be noted:\n- The addition of three methyl groups (CH3) to the citrate molecule increases the size and mass of the molecule, which can reduce the effectiveness of hydrogen bonding on a per-atom basis, and we can estimate this as -10\u00b0C.\n- The ester linkage (C=O) between the carboxyl group and the methyl group in the tri-n-butyl citrate molecule increases the steric hindrance between the carboxyl group and the methyl group, which can reduce the effectiveness of hydrogen bonding on a per-atom basis, and we can estimate this as -5\u00b0C.\nOverall, the addition of the methyl groups and the ester linkage gives a predicted melting point for tri-n-butyl citrate.",
