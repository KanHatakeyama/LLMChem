    "Reason": "- Furan ring: The furan ring in this molecule is a planar, aromatic system with a melting point of -10\u00b0C.\n- Bromine substituent: The bromine atom adds a degree of steric hindrance and electronegativity, which can increase the melting point by +50\u00b0C.\n- 5-Bromofuran-2-yl group: This functional group adds additional steric hindrance and electronegativity, which can increase the melting point by +20\u00b0C.\n- 1-Furan-2-ylprop-2-en-1-one group: This functional group adds additional steric hindrance and electronegativity, which can increase the melting point by +10\u00b0C.\n- Double bond: The presence of a conjugated double bond in the molecule can increase the melting point by +10\u00b0C.",
