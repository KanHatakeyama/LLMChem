    "Reason": "Isatin is a heterocyclic aromatic compound with a melting point of approximately 105\u00b0C. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the base structure of isatin can increase the melting point due to the increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The acetyl group (\u2013COCH3) can also contribute to the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and increase the rigidity of the molecule. The presence of multiple aromatic rings in the structure of isatin can also contribute to the melting point due to their ability to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The modification may involve adding a few degrees for each aromatic ring due to the increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, as well as the increased rigidity of the molecule due to the acetyl group.",
