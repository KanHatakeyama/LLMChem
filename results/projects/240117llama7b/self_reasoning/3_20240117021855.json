    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be ethanol, which has a melting point of -114.1\u00b0C. Considering the structural changes leading to methyl propyl sulfide, the following should be noted:\n- The addition of a methyl group (CH3) to the side chain of a propane molecule (C3H7) increases the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding, which we can estimate as +20\u00b0C compared to ethanol.\n- The sulfur atom in methyl propyl sulfide increases the melting point due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding, which we can estimate as +40\u00b0C compared to ethanol.\n- The methyl group in methyl propyl sulfide also increases the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding, which we can estimate as +20\u00b0C compared to ethanol.\nOverall, the addition of the methyl group and the sulfur atom in methyl propyl sulfide gives a predicted melting point for this compound.",
