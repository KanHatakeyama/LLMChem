    "Reason": "The compound (1Z,3Z)-3-(hydroxyimino)-1-(2-nitrophenyl)-2,3-diphenylprop-1-en-1-ol has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that contribute to its melting point. The base structure of 2,3-diphenylprop-1-en-1-ol has a melting point of approximately -40\u00b0C. The hydroxyimino group (-NH2) adds a significant increase in melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can be estimated at around +50\u00b0C to +70\u00b0C. The nitro group (NO2) adds to the melting point due to its electronegativity and polarizability, which can be estimated at around +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C. The phenyl groups (C6H5) add to the melting point due to their bulkiness and potential for pi-pi stacking, which can be estimated at around +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C. The presence of two phenyl groups in a trans configuration can increase the melting point due to better packing in the solid state, which can be estimated at around +5\u00b0C.",
