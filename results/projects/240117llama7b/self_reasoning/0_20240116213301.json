    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is nitric acid, which has a melting point of -42.5 degrees Celsius. The introduction of a methyl group generally lowers the melting point because it can disrupt the crystal lattice of the molecular solid, making it easier to melt. In this case, the addition of a methyl group to the central carbon of nitric acid is expected to reduce the melting point by approximately 50 degrees, reflecting the changes in intermolecular forces and the reduced symmetry of the molecule which disrupts the efficient packing in the solid state.",
