    "Reason": "The compound 1-benzyl-4-boc-piperazine has a melting point of approximately -20\u00b0C. The basic unit is piperazine, which has a melting point of -20\u00b0C. The benzyl group adds steric bulk and increases molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point. We can estimate an increase of approximately +20\u00b0C for the benzyl group. The boc group (benzyloxycarbonyl) adds a small rigidity to the molecule, so we can estimate a small increase of +5\u00b0C. The total estimated impact on the melting point from all functional groups is: -20 (base) + 20 (benzyl group) + 5 (boc group) = 45\u00b0C.",
