    "Reason": "The compound (1Z,3Z)-3-(hydroxyimino)-1-(2-nitrophenyl)-2,3-diphenylprop-1-en-1-ol has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. The base structure is 2,3-diphenylprop-1-en-1-ol, which has a melting point of approximately -10\u00b0C. The functional groups include:\n- Hydroxyimino group (NH2): adds a hydrogen bonding ability, which significantly increases the melting point. An educated estimate for this effect is +50\u00b0C to +70\u00b0C.\n- Nitro group (NO2): adds polarity and electronegativity, which can increase intermolecular forces and raise the melting point. An estimated effect could be around +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C due to the polar nature of the nitro group.\n- Phenyl groups (2 and 3): add steric bulk and increase molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point. Each phenyl group can contribute approximately +20\u00b0C to the melting point.\n- Diphenyl linkage: adds rigidity and planarity to the molecule, which can increase the melting point. An estimated effect could be around +20\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C due to the increased molecular symmetry and rigidity.\nConsidering these adjustments, the values are summation of the estimated effects.",
