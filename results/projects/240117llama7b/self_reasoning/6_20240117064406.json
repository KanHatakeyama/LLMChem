    "Reason": "The base structure for the target compound is a fused aromatic ring system, which significantly increases the melting point due to the rigidity and potential for strong intermolecular interactions. The indole ring itself has a melting point of around 55 degrees Celsius, and the carbonitrile group can contribute to the melting point due to its polarity and potential for dipole-dipole interactions. The presence of a nitrogen atom can also increase the melting point due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and potential for pi-pi stacking. Considering the overall structure, an estimated increase of +50 is reasoned for the melting point, accounting for the combined effect of the fused aromatic rings and the carbonitrile group.",
