    "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by several structural factors including molecular weight, symmetry, and the strength of intermolecular forces. For 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene, several functional group effects should be considered: \n- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. \n- Bromo group: A heavy halogen like bromine adds significant molecular weight and polarizability to the compound, which could reasonably be expected to increase the melting point due to stronger London dispersion forces. The bromo group typically raises the melting point by an estimated +20 \u00b0C over unsubstituted benzene. \n- Nitro group: The nitro group is an electron-withdrawing group that increases the polarity of the molecule and can allow for stronger dipole-dipole interactions and potentially hydrogen bonding with protic solvents. However, in a nonprotic crystalline state, its main effect would be on the polarity and rigidity of the compound. The contribution to the melting point could be estimated at +15 \u00b0C over benzene. \nConsidering the individual effects, one might expect these functional groups to have mostly additive impacts on the melting point, but some deviation from strict additivity can occur due to the disruption of the aromatic system's symmetry by the substituents.",
