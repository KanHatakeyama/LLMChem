    "Reason": "Indole-5-carbonitrile is a small molecule with a basic structure of a benzene ring and an indole ring. The indole ring itself has a melting point of around 100\u00b0C due to its planarity and the presence of nitrogen, which can form hydrogen bonds. The benzene ring contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and conjugation, which can increase the melting point by around 20\u00b0C. The nitrile group can also contribute to the melting point due to its electronegativity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point by around 10\u00b0C.",
