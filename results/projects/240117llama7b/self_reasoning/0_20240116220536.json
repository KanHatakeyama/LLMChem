    "Reason": "- Basic unit, acetyl group has a melting point of -25\u00b0C. \n- Isatin group: adds significantly since it introduces aromaticity and nitrogen lone pair, which greatly increases the melting point. An educated estimate for this effect is +100\u00b0C to +120\u00b0C. \n- Carbonyl group (C=O): adds to the melting point due to its electronegativity and the polarizability of the C=O bond, which increases intermolecular forces. An estimated effect could be around +10\u00b0C to +15\u00b0C due to the polar nature of the C=O bond and potential increase in molecular symmetry.",
