    "Reason": "Leflunomide has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that can affect its melting point. The base structure is a fused aromatic ring system, which can contribute to a higher melting point due to increased rigidity and potential for intermolecular interactions. The nitrogen atom in the ring can participate in hydrogen bonding, which can also increase the melting point. The fluorine atoms can increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and ability to participate in dipole-dipole interactions. The phenyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its aromaticity and potential for intermolecular interactions. The methyl group can decrease the melting point due to its small size and lack of potential for intermolecular interactions. The overall structure is relatively rigid and planar, which supports a higher melting point.",
