    "Reason": "The base unit, uridine, has a melting point of 100\u00b0C. The deoxy group (-OH) adds to the melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding potential, estimated at +20\u00b0C. The nitrogen atom in the base unit can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might increase the melting point by +10\u00b0C. The carbonyl group in the base unit can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which might increase the melting point by +10\u00b0C. The presence of a sugar ring tends to increase the melting point due to increased molecular weight and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated at +50\u00b0C. The presence of a nitro group can significantly increase the melting point due to its strong electronegative nature and the capability for intermolecular interactions, contributing approximately +30\u00b0C. The presence of a carbonyl group can also increase the melting point due to its electronegativity and the potential for intermolecular interactions, estimated at +10\u00b0C. The overall effect of the deoxyuridine structure is estimated at +50\u00b0C for the sugar ring, +30\u00b0C for the nitro group, and +10\u00b0C for the carbonyl group.",
