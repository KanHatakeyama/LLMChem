    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison could be 2-methyl-2-methylene-propanoic acid, which has a melting point of 125.5 \u00b0C. The chlorine atom in the target compound increases the molecular weight and polarizability, which can enhance the intermolecular interactions and raise the melting point. The carboxylic acid group also contributes to the melting point due to its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding.\n\nConsidering the functional groups, the chlorine atom adds +20 \u00b0C to the melting point, and the carboxylic acid group adds +30 \u00b0C. The overall effect of these functional groups on the melting point is estimated to be +50 \u00b0C over the basic unit.",
