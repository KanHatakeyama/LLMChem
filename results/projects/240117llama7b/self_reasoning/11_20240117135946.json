    "Reason": "The base structure for the target compound is a simple alkylamine with a melting point of approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The presence of an octyl group (n-octyl) adds significant bulk and steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and rigidity. The nitrogen atom in the amine group can form hydrogen bonds, which can also contribute to the melting point. The estimated effect for the octyl group is around +40 degrees, and the nitrogen atom can contribute +5 degrees.",
