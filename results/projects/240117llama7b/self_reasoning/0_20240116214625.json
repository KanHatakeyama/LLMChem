    "Reason": "Leflunomide is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, including a phenyl ring, a methylene bridge, and a fluorine atom. The phenyl ring is polar and planar, which can contribute to the molecule's rigidity and increase its melting point. The methylene bridge is flexible and can disrupt the crystal lattice, leading to a lowering of the melting point. The fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and can increase the molecule's polarity, which can also contribute to a higher melting point. However, the presence of multiple functional groups in different parts of the molecule can also lead to a decrease in the overall symmetry of the molecule, which can reduce the effect of the functional groups on the melting point.\nBased on these considerations, we estimate that the melting point of leflunomide is around 170-180 degrees Celsius.",
