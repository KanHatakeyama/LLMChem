    "Reason": "- The basic unit for comparison could be cyclohexanol, which has a melting point around 25.93\u00b0C. Given that trifenmorph has three hydroxyl (-OH) groups compared to one in cyclohexanol, the extensive hydrogen bonding possible due to these groups significantly increases the melting point. Each additional -OH group contributes to the increase: \n\n- Hydroxyl group: For simplicity, if we consider incremental effects, taking cyclohexanol as a starting point with a melting point of around 25.93\u00b0C, each additional -OH group could contribute roughly (249.5 - 25.93)/5 \u2248 44.7\u00b0C to the melting point as they allow for extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which stabilizes the solid state. However, this is a simplified approximation because the effect of each additional -OH group is not perfectly additive due to steric and electronic considerations.\n\nTherefore: \n- Basic unit (cyclohexanol): 25.93 \n- Three hydroxyl groups (3 additional to the parent compound): 3 * 44.7 \u2248 133.1\nCombined estimated effect: 25.93 + 133.1 \u2248 159.0",
