    "Reason": "The compound maprotiline has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. The base unit, a phenyl group, has a melting point of approximately 80\u00b0C. The addition of a nitro group increases the melting point by approximately +20\u00b0C due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of a methyl group adds +10\u00b0C due to increased van der Waals forces. The tert-butyl group contributes +40\u00b0C due to increased bulkiness and steric hindrance. The phenyl ring in the 3-position has a higher melting point than a simple phenyl group due to increased conjugation and potential for hydrogen bonding. The methyl group in the 4-position reduces the melting point slightly due to increased flexibility. The overall effect of the functional groups on the melting point is approximately +100\u00b0C.",
