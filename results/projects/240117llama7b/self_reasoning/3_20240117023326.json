    "Reason": "The melting point of indole-5-carbonitrile can be predicted by considering the functional groups present in the molecule. The basic unit for comparison is indole, which has a melting point of 105.5\u00b0C. The nitrile group typically increases the melting point due to the potential for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity. Let's estimate a +20\u00b0C contribution from the nitrile group. The aromatic ring in indole also contributes to the melting point due to its planarity and increased stability, which can be estimated at +30\u00b0C. The carbon chain in the carbonitrile group can also contribute to the melting point due to its length and potential for van der Waals interactions, which can be estimated at +10\u00b0C. Finally, the methyl group can slightly increase the melting point due to its small size and potential for hydrogen bonding, which can be estimated at +5\u00b0C.",
