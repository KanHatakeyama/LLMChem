    "Reason": "The structure of 5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxylic acid consists of a basic isoxazole ring, which has a melting point of approximately -10 degrees Celsius. The methyl group adds rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can increase the melting point. The carboxylic acid group can also participate in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and can dimerize, which can further increase the melting point. The estimated contribution of each carboxylic acid group to the melting point is approximately 213.8 degrees Celsius, allowing for the inclusion of the strong hydrogen bonding effects and dimerization.",
