    "Reason": "The compound N',N'''-(1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-diyl)bis[1-phenyl(thiourea)] has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. The bicyclic ring system contributes to the rigidity and potential for intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which increases the melting point. The phenyl group adds a conjugated double bond and an aromatic-like structure, which can participate in \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and increase the melting point. The thiourea group can participate in hydrogen bonding and can also increase the melting point due to its polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions. The trimethyl groups on the bicyclic ring can increase the melting point due to their bulkiness and potential for intermolecular interactions.",
