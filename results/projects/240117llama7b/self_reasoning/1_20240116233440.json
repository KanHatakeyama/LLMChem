    "Reason": "The basic unit for comparison is acetone, which has a melting point of approximately -56.0 degrees Celsius. Methyl nitrite has a nitro functional group, which can increase the melting point due to the increased steric hindrance and electronegativity. The nitro group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point.\n\nBased on the effect of a single nitro group on the melting point of acetone, we can estimate that the methyl nitrite melting point is increased by approximately 20 degrees Celsius.",
