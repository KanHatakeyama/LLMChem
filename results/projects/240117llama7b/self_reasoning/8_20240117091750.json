    "Reason": "The basic unit for 5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxylic acid is isoxazole, which has a melting point of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The methyl group attached to the base unit increases the molecular weight and can potentially disrupt efficient molecular packing, which would lower the melting point by about 20 degrees Celsius. The carboxylic acid group can also contribute to a higher melting point due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, estimated to be around +20 degrees Celsius.",
