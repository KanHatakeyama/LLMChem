    "Reason": "The compound 3-[(E)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)vinyl]-2-methyl-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-indole has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that affect its melting point. The basic unit, indole, has a melting point of 6.5\u00b0C. The phenyl group contributes significantly to the melting point due to its aromaticity and the potential for pi-pi interactions. An estimated effect for the phenyl group is around +30\u00b0C. The sulfur atom in the sulfone group can form hydrogen bonds, which tend to increase the melting point. An estimated effect for the sulfone group is around +20\u00b0C. The two chlorine atoms in the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group increase the melting point due to their electronegativity and polarizability, which increase intermolecular forces. An estimated effect for the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group is around +15\u00b0C. The vinyl group can contribute to the melting point due to its conjugation and potential for pi-pi interactions. An estimated effect for the vinyl group is around +10\u00b0C. Finally, the methyl group can contribute to the melting point due to its increased molecular weight and potential for van der Waals interactions. An estimated effect for the methyl group is around +5\u00b0C. Considering these adjustments, the values are the summation of the estimated effects.",
