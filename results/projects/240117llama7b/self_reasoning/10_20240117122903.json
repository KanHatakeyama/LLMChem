    "Reason": "The melting point of a compound is influenced by several structural factors including molecular weight, symmetry, and the strength of intermolecular forces. For 4-dimethylaminobenzonitrile, several functional group effects should be considered: \n- Basic unit, benzene, has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. \n- Dimethylamino group: The nitrogen atom in the amino group can form hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules, which can increase the melting point. The estimated effect for a simple amino group might be around +10 \u00b0C. However, the presence of two methyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and polarizability, as well as the potential for increased hydrogen bonding. The estimated effect for the methyl groups might be around +5 \u00b0C each. \nConsidering the individual effects, one might expect these functional groups to have mostly additive impacts on the melting point, but some deviation from strict additivity can occur due to the disruption of the aromatic system's symmetry by the substituents.",
