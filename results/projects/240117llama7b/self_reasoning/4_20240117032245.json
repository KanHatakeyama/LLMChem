    "Reason": "The basic unit for 2-cyclohexylbenzoic acid is benzoic acid, which has a melting point of 5.5 \u00b0C. The addition of a cyclohexyl group adds significant bulk and steric hindrance, which can increase the melting point due to the increased molecular weight and reduced conformational freedom. The presence of a carboxyl group also adds polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which can further increase the melting point. The cyclohexyl group can also contribute to the melting point due to its ring structure and potential for pi-pi interactions.",
