    "Reason": "The compound 1-benzyl-4-boc-piperazine has a melting point that can be predicted by considering the functional groups present:\n- Benzyl group: adds a rigid, planar structure with increased molecular weight, which typically raises the melting point. Estimate an increase of approximately +20\u00b0C.\n- Boc group (t-butyl): adds bulkiness and rigidity to the molecule, which can increase the melting point. Estimate an increase of approximately +10\u00b0C.\n- Piperazine ring: Heteroaromatic rings can have variable effects on melting point, depending on the substitution pattern. For this case, considering the conjugation and additional ring, we might estimate an increase of about +20\u00b0C.\n- Carbon chain: Being a small linker, its influence is small. However, it adds rigidity to the molecule, so we can estimate a small increase of +5\u00b0C.",
