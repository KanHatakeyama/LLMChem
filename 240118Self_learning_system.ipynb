      "The compound has a melting point of 5.5°C, which is the melting point of the parent compound, benzene. The carboxylic acid ester functional group is present, which typically decreases the melting point by approximately -20 to -40°C due to less symmetry and weaker intermolecular forces, like hydrogen bonding. Each of the two hydroxy groups contributes to an increase in melting point due to increased hydrogen bonding capability. The hydroxy group on the benzene can raise the melting point by about 50 to 80°C because it participates in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds due to its position on the rigid benzene ring. In contrast, the hydroxy group on the ethyl chain might contribute a smaller increase because of its greater rotational freedom and the flexibility of the chain, potentially around 20-40°C. Taken together, the net effect of the two hydroxy groups could be estimated to increase the melting point by 70 to 120°C.\n",

The methylene bridges (CH2) between the cyclohexane rings contribute to the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, which can significantly increase the melting point, estimated to contribute +50°C. Each methyl group, due to its bulkiness, increases the molecular weight and steric hindrance, which would typically raise the melting point; assuming an additive effect, each methyl can contribute approximately +20°C to the melting point.

The basic unit of heroin is a benzene ring, which has a melting point of 5.5°C.

The presence of multiple methyl groups (-CH3) can contribute to a further increase in melting point due to their bulkiness and steric hindrance, estimated at +20°C each.
